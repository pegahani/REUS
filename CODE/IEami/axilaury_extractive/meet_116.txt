Hello  Hello 

you all read what we are going to do or not 

Were gonna make a remote control 

I just made a a simple uh presentation 

thats my name  
Uh were going to make uh a remote control 

are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting 
You know  this is about twenty five minutes  this meeting 

it has to be original  trendy  userfriendly

Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control 
Fir the first thing is th the functional design 

We have to look what the needs are  the effects of the functional design  and and how the mm the the remote control works  so thats where were going to look in the functional design 

The the second thing is the conceptual design 

thats uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface 
And we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market 
And the third thing is uh the detailed design

its exactly how it looks and whatever 

these are two smartboards  with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one 
And you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map 

what were going to do first is um

You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard

and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen 

and um and say why its your favourite animal 

first have to show you 
maybe you can come here to have a look how it works 

Use pen format 
and a different colour can use here

line width ten 

Just draw slowly 
because otherwise it wont work 
Its a very nice elephant  you can see 

Its a bit slow you can see 
this is a bit annoying 

and then uh whats the colour 
How do I do

Its in format 

Just make a new blank new blank page 

Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back 

lets make it um a dog 

I make a cat of it 

I just draw too quick I think 

I thought these pens would be just um uh you write it down and you download it to Word 

but you actually got to write on the paper 

but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word 

but its just a picture 

Y you can you cant edit in the edit it in Word 

its not that cool as I th thought it would be 

Now we just have to save everything 

what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros 

And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros 
so we have to uh use a big market in Europe 
The production cost are about half the price of selling price 

can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million 

were gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything 

You have to put it exactly on the on the

My laptop is crashing 

Uh actually my laptop doesnt work 

Okay  I think it works 

How does this work 

Press F eleven 

my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control 

thats a good question 

Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television  we sell it uh apart 

Yeah  it probably would be universal 

I dont think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros 

I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros

we we just say we just say thats universal remote control 

And uh also for the VCR and uh DVD player

so a lot of buttons on the remote control 

what what whats a remote control 
its just a black thing with some buttons on it 

we can try to make it special 

Um if we uh control the VCR and the DVD player player with it uh it has to be clear 

And how big should it be 

It shouldnt be too big 
but I dont think we can make it too small 

We cant make it smaller than the things we see now I think 

Or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem 

maybe more trendy 
Fold open 
where you can see uh more options  I think

something uh on top  just dren general things like volume and TV channels and inside things you dont use that often 

O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control 

Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control 

or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small 

But its not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it 

And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control 
because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken 

And if you have a touch screen in it  its definitely too too fragile uh fragile 

You can put games on your remote control  Whatever 

And uh how about the batteries 
Uh should you put it in a recharger

Ma maybe a home station 

but yeah  we have to look at the price now I think 

uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger 

if you buy it uh separately from your phone its probably expensive 
but I dont know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing 

because maybe its too expensive 

Uh if you th look at the market  its probably its still the best way just to put batteries in it 

but a home station is uh a really good idea 
because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and dont know where it is 

Maybe uh use it as a separate option  Sell it uh separately 

and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station 
or you can change your batteries 

The option  just the option  thats cool 

Uh I I set something on paper already  size  looks  uh usable 
uh the buttons on usable places 
uh the the on off button must be on top 
uh it has to lay good in the hand 

does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control

uh if if we want to make it special  we probably have to do a lot of testing  if it really works 

you can um have uh the basic things on the same place  like on off button on top and the TV channels one two three four as a block  and then the volume uh obviously on t on top  so you can see 
But the rest is uh you dont use that often 
so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it  it should be clear as well 

And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open 

Uh on on top are the the basic options on top 

basically when Im watching TV Im just using like five buttons or so 

maybe its very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like its very uh uh

Mm  If you if if you make to fold open its or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control 

So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square  just normal remote control 
Just think about it 
We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting 

We have uh another thirty minutes 
so then were going to meet again 

Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert  the user requirements uh specification  do I need to think as a user 

whats in the market 

I think this if you you have to n know if its for s a TV  a DVD player  all that things 

uh what kind of uh buttons do you have 

Theres already a document in the folder about it 

I already wrote some down  some ideas 

see you in thirty minutes
