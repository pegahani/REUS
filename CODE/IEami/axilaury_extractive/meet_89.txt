so weve got new project requirements 

So basically weve got three things 
and weve got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options 

W I I got um or or three things basically  um relating to the remote being only for TV 
We discussed that last time

Um weve got uh teletext outdated 

Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing 
So I I got that in email form 

Okay Im gonna be looking at the working design 

Um Ive just got three sections 
first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um 
And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote 
Um so having researched the existing models within the market  um I found my research off the internet  Um Ive established what the components required for the remote control to function  actually are 
And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do

Um the basic components are an energy source
which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply 

We then have the user interface  which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote 
Um the various functions used for changing channel  uh channel up and down  volume  things like that 
Um theres also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things 
And then the sender  which um is usually  Ive found  an infrared device which sends a signal to the actual television 
Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system

because thats obviously found in the television 

Um Im gonna have to actually draw on the board
because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working 

a power supply
we then have a particular button 

thats obviously theres lots and lots of different buttons 

after you press that that sends the message to the chip 

and then sends the appropriate message to the sender 

thats the components of the remote

So this is the uh user interface 

And then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver 

which then  and thats the thats the infrared sender 

going on to personal preferences  Ive said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote 
just because of the size 

and infrared um has been used quite successfully 

Um and then the sender 

Um  Okay so Im gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design 

Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set  so that a desired function is performed 

Um here are two example remotes 
Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward  rewind functions 
so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we wont have to worry about 
Uh but as you can see  the left remote is quite um quite busy looking  quite complicated 
Um whereas the right remote is much simpler 
it looks much more user friendly 
Um so my personal preference would be the right remote 

its got a very limited number of buttons 

So  its got nice big buttons 

Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that 
So its very very user friendly 

But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan 

Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme 

Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here  the the sort of circular section 

So we could dispense with that little bit as well

because that seems to be for a video as well 

and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume 

And I dont really think that you need nine numbers 
I mean how often do you use seven  eight and nine 
I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough 

Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time 
and wed have to have some room for uh future such channels 

but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place  certainly the button up and down 

and uh theres uh I dont know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others 

Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels

Um some remotes have kind of favourite options

Yeah  I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if youve got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred  you could go one to one to ten  ten to twenty
and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want

But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff  that would be tuned to one channel 
and then youd have another remote for all of those channels 

Limit the number of buttons 

But I suppose nines not really excessive 

you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever 

How many buttons have we got 
Weve just got ten  eleven twelve th

Well weve weve got um that its remote for TV only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations 

weve done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control 

and um how do people use it 
We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them 

And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that wed prepared and asking them to fill in the answers 
And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly
and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control
And that of all the buttons on the remote control  the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings  um they werent used very often at all 
People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons 
Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control 
And young people were quite receptive to this 
but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older  people people werent quite so keen on speech recognition 
Theres a lot more th theres a lot lot more older people who didnt know whether they wanted it or not as well 

and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldnt find it 
And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control  it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions  and to find your way around it 

My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high hightech

Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market 
and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power  and also volume and that sort of thing  as as Louisa said 
Um we could maybe come up with a menu  a sort of a an LCD menu for other functions on the remote control 

Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well 
because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a hightech design 

And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if its lost in a room  rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels 
Cause theres a problem with that in that the television makes noise 
so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel 

What was that last wee bit there 

Um about speech recognition 

But that was only for young people that preferred it  older people didnt 

and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for for the speech recognition  Um 
And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have
You know with your mobile phone  you lose that and you can ring it 
Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two 
So you can press a button which is always kept in one place
and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else  wherever the remote actually is 

Yeah  wed have t that would mean wed have to put two products together as well 

Theres key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at 

and then they whistle back  or something like that 
Thatd probably be really simple 

Well if youre trying to avoid having a second product cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing  you know without sound recognition 

or like the same technology could be put inside the inside the remote 

I mean obviously if youve got voice recognition then you can do it in that way

Um I was gonna say a sharp noise  you know a clapping of hand or whatever 

a set command whatever that happened to be 

and you can give it a command 

because itll recognise the voice

you could have an option to turn it off  Or

So that would solve the problems with the TV kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels 

Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control 

Well if it does then we cant 

and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out 
So anything that uh is to be added  such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick
because time to market is is critical  S

But probably quick and simple is primary rather than added extras 

Uh d d I think I think first and foremost weve gotta get to the end
and then get to the end with um added extras if possible 

But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions
and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person thats got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is 

And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting  if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time youd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process  then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting 

If you get the information just before the next meeting thats fine 

But if you get it well before the next meeting  let everybody else know

Well  so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be
On the basis that if weve got if were catering to the whole age range  you want something thats easy to do 

Well I think itd be really easy and itd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function 

I dont really know about the voice recognition thing 

clapping  I think clapping 

Kay weve already decided that we dont need a teletext button  havent we 

Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers
and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together 

I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number 

Ill put delay to allow um multiple numbers 

Uh we could possibly put an L a sort of a LCD menu in 
but that again is probably an expense that

you only have to probably tune in the TV once 

So and if finally the TV breaks  you get a new one  youre gonna have to be able to tune it 

the the product weve got is something thats at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale 
so were not really going for something thats uh terribly hightech 

I mean were maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions 
so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in 

Would you maybe have like one menu button  then youd use the other buttons  maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions 

Yeah  cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well 

Well  if were trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well  have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down  so theres kind of um everything else revealed 
So you dont use it that much 

That is that is a good idea actually 

So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back 

And thatll be better for the older generation as well

So um were gonna have to have to work out whats gonna be on these other functions as as well 

The detailed ones would be sort of brightness 

So on front 

about the number 
Um the volume up and down 

A mute button as well 

And probably a power one as well 

I know its probably like um not an issue to raise here  but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity 

Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby 
Yeah  its maybe too much of a big issue for here 

But then they might not buy it if they havent got one 

So so are you having the standby on the front  then 

Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons 

Um cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick  so 

So weve got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there 

Numbers is ten 
volume is twelve 

And a mute  yeah 

And then at the back 

Youve got brightness and contrast 

Maybe if were gonna run out of time  one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what theyre gonna be 

Uh theres audio functions 

Youre also gonna have the channel tuner  as it were 

And then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know  saying that you want that particular thing tuned in 

So I think um theres quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio  surround sort of things 

Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products  then 

Um I think theyve got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel 

Yeah I suppose if weve got their if theyve got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple 

Right so Ill do the minutes of uh this meeting 

Well shall we look into that and just get back together
