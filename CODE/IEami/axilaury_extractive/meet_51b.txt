um we decided to use a kinetic charger 
standard chip  um cause it can come in various different sizes 

We wanted a standby function 
The case material is gonna be soft  rubbery  changeable 
Um buttons with a combination of LCD and rubber according to the design 
Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit  keeping with the hip kind of feel 
Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that 

Prototype presentation 

Um and the rubber buttons that well use will be antiRSI 

Me and William worked on a prototype 
and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that 

I can hold it like

and Ill Ill show you the presentation 

And well first look at the exterior of what weve uh come up with over there  Um
Its gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour  either were thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something 
This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing
um which thered be sort of a wide choice

Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns 

Um its obviously an a sort of clamshell design
and uh the um the top LCD screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um how do you say  its yeah yeah  it would be sort of inset into the into the top

The black and white touch screen

and the buttons at the bottom would d

so so itll fully close flat 

weve um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries 
which actually  thinking about it now  could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well 

So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections 

Um we decided that um the voice recognition system  it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in
and they were fairly easy to get ahold of 
so we presumed that theyd also be quite cheap 
So youd have something like where youd shout out  where where is the remote and itll shout back  Im here  or something 

Um the standard  theres be a standard transmission with the TV using using all the standard chips that weve talked about 

obviously cause its split over two two different layers 
it would need two separate PCBs 
so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling 
And uh because  obviously  all TVs use this  the same infrared medium 
wed just be using using the same thing to transmit the data 
And the infrared um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer  just at the front of the

So when youve actually got it open  it would be facing the TV 
And then finally um on to the interface 
The top screen  as we said  is would be an inset um black and white LCD s touch screen
which yeah would uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it 
uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons  like the vo volume up and down  channel up and down  power on and off  and uh things to that effect 
And now weve we also decided on the inside  we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled uh logo on it  or something inset  or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top 

But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product

And finally thats how we put the fashion back into electronics 
as that is thats the company logo 

Um Ive now got evaluation criteria 

This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research 

the collection of the criteria  as we saw in our previous meeting  was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company 

are we actually meeting those trends and requirements 

So its what weve discussed in the last meeting 

The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel  technological innovation  it should be easy to use  it should incorporate current fashion trends 
and those the two main ones  they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours 
The design should minimise RSI
and be easy to locate
and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there 
though that did seem to be the favoured strategy 

Were going to use a seven point scale 
where one is true
and seven is false 

and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here 

Is it everybody is going to evaluate  or just the Market

w well discuss each one
and well come to a consensus rating between one and seven 

I wont write all of that out again 
It will just be criteria one  two  three  four  five  six 

Actually  it might be an idea  if we each did give our own individual rating 
and we could take an average at the end 

So Ill just separate the ratings by obliques 
and if we go one  two  three  four  we know whos who 

Criteria A  the fancy look and feel 

My own rating for that would be a two 

Two and three quarters 

criteria B  criterion B  technologically innovative 
I would give that a three 

Id give it a one 

Its just two point five for that one 

ease of use 

Based on what youve said there  I would say a one  true 

I would say a two  I would say a two 
One point seven f five 

it incorporates current fashion trends 

Im just thinking  before I give it my rating  you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here 
Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use 

the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue 
but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th its full sort of customised 

So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and thats what were intending to do 

cause th thats thats the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it 

In that case its got to be a one for me 

Yeah  Ill give it a one as well 

to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury 

I dont think weve really touched on that a lot 

we havent really come up with anything that we felt could feasibly reduce that 

but the very use of a remote control  if youre someone whos zapping  whos sitting like that  and we found so many people did  how do you minimise that on such a small device 

the type of button that were gonna use in the bottom half  the material  minimises RSI

but with the amount of stuff were putting on it isnt that much 

I think Im gonna have to be neutral on that
and give it a four 

Id uh Id f Id go for a five  actually 

And finally  last but not least  easy to locate 
Now we talked about voice recognition 
we talked about a beeper 

Yeah  it was it was uh a voice voice recognition 

have the designers come to any dec real decision on that 

And are we happy with the costs on that  That is going to be feasible  costwise 

Yeah  yeah  that yeah  thats feasible 

And if you didnt hear it in the room that you were standing in  then youd realise that it wasnt in that room  youd go into another room 

it would be quite loud 

Thats a one for me 

I do realise that we might be being fairly biased 
cause it is our product 

Weve got our our weve got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there  That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate 
The lowest rating weve got  which is really n its not terribly low 
i its close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury 
Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it 
or do we have to make further modifications 

I dont think so 

We happy to go ahead 

I think we yeah  I think were set 

I think for most of those ratings that its high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that 

Ill just leave it there 

Ive got finance here now 

We just type numbers into this
and we come out with the final value 
So are we still on for kinetic 

Yeah 

See  it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning 
Um it might have influenced our choice 

It was a regular chip on print

you youve put in three for the number of kinetic cells 
there should just be one 

one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker 

One double curve 

cause its two 

whats a single curve then 

It would just be a flat bottom with one curve  like a domed thing 

Um weve got plastic and rubber 

I think rubber  since its being used just as a casing 

See  it says case material 

were not actually using plastic in the case 

Theres nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing 
So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there 

Or sh we should just put it in as one 
because the plastic is zero anyway 

special colour  do we need that 

Might do  if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours 

the pushbuttons one

and LC display one 

I think we could change the battery also 
Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery 

and I really doubt if on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities  we could actually do much more to minimise that 

and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing 
is that going to make a difference 

so the highest weve got is the electronics here  Um and the interface 

If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries  would that make a huge difference 

it um it would make one difference 

What I feel is  customers never said anything about the battery 

but if you take away the voice recognition  then youve got it 

If you took away that  thatll make it twelve point three five 

If we change it to the battery its thats minus three 

We could do the voice recognition for  you know  business class or something  you know  like an upgraded version 

I dont see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now 
because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product 

We can put in our recommendations 
If we if were working to head office specifications as this is what this project teams working for  we can put in our recommendations for what weve weve found and what we the consensus that weve come to as a result of the meetings 

Um as you say  we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers

So if we take voice recognition out

Thatll do it  Twelve point three five 
Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty 

we are close to the budget 

So we are under the budget 

Product evaluation 
Weve done room for creativity 

Because weve got decisions that we would have made that we werent didnt feel able to make  Um
I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork 

Although we had our separate tasks 

I think we had a nice time 

there was so much interaction 
so much that we needed to um bounce off each other 

in that in relevant areas weve been able to  you know  give and take
and adjust our remit where necessary 

Yeah  I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody 

We came to a very predic creative design  yeah 

And Sarah  you coordinated the work very well 

I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if wed seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out  I think maybe it wouldve come out a d little different 

although we didnt quite make the voice recognition in there 
but thats thats good 

I liked the fact that we could say an idea and itd be suggested that that wasnt the best idea  but no one felt like shot down 

you two created that wonderful specimen of a PlayDoh model 

Um means  whiteboard  digital pens  etcetera  what does that mean  Any ideas 

How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information 
Could itve been better 

I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more  had we actually had had more time and if wed been separated more 

I think its new ideas in general 

Its really borrowing from other areas  its  you know  bringing things from other areas in 

Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones  like a real want to see a new launch or something like that 

but nobody giving uh much idea to this 

I think its really good that this has been very market research based 
because just going back to mobile phones  I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really  you know  say is is obvious and visible 
We see it in mobile phones a lot 
and tha thats where weve borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from 
There are innovations in that that people dont really want 

and I think its wonderful our companys so R and D based 

Um our costs are below budget
with recommendations that they the budget be increased 

Do you think thats takes into account um overheads like us being well paid kind of a thing  And the heating for the building  do you think our budget includes everything  all the costs that are going out 

I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone 

I think weve done very well to get within budget

Um and weve got the meeting survey and questionnaire 

Theres a final questionnaire 

weve got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with 

I think Ive got minutes for two of the meeting and the last thingy
