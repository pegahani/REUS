I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes  minute 

were going to talk about the conceptual model 

we just talked about it looks 
Has to look nice 
Usability is very important 
People dont want to spend money on something thats similar to cheaper ones  Um
It has to be very basic 
not too many buttons 
Light switches on if you use a button 
Uh text TV still has to be a possibility 
And it has to be easy to learn 

And the functions are volume  channel to choose channels  an onoff  a mute uh button  and a text TV button  That are the functions 

I just want to give you uh Mike again  the first uh presentation

I received an email

uh and uh I searched uh on this d document  recent investigation of the remote control market 
It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in uh another country in Europe 

Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy lookandfeel  instead of the current functional look and feel 
So its very important for us to create something new 

Fancy stands for an original lookandfeel of the case and interface 
Uh this uh aspect is the most important one 

It uh is twice important as the following 
The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative 
Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features 
And then uh that uh This is a point of discussion 
because we just decided that we dont make use of uh LCD or uh speech recognition 

But we already have the flashing flashing light

Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use 

We already discussed that 

Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy 
So I took uh that part of the webpage 
And it says uh fashionwatchers of uh uh Pari uh France and uh Italy  yeah  uh have detected the following trends 
This trends I th uh trend I think its not um that meaningful for us  maybe 
But its about uh clothes and shoes 
But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year  the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy 

Spongy  like sponge 

So rubber  kind of 

Uh soft materials 

But maybe th thats al definitely a good idea 
because youve youre you drop y your remote control very often on the ground 

But I didnt knew uh knew what it means 

its also a stressball 

Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control 
I think about changeable fronts 
Uh maybe a seethrough one in a a fruit front 

And uh some basic uh colour fronts 

Uh maybe an extraordinary shape  like a sponge 

just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has 

We have to discuss about that 

Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative 

how do we do that 
Maybe speech 
We ma must have some kind of gadget 

Its very uh difficult to to to do it 
Because its only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control 

thats the problem  Thats the main problem 

Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations 

actually we have dont have an idea how much its gonna cost 
But maybe its cheap
and its easy to implement 

if we implement uh speech recognition  I think it would be better to implement LCD as well 
Since you have to uh configure speech thing 

But a telephone also have a LCD and and its about t two hundred Euros 

We have to decide on that 

I got an email uh
And it says uh the chip can be uh simple  regular or advanced 

They say uh a display requires an advanced chip 
And this is more expensive than all the other chips 

And speech recognition 

Yeah  probably too 
I I havent got anything about speech recognition 

I had uh to make a sort of a design 

I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls 

So I did some searching on the internet 

This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment 
I think we should go more to the iPod and MP three players  Mobile phones 

just modern modern but still uh basic 

Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller 
Cause remote con control  you can see it here  you have to bo reach both out both sides 
And here you just have one  few buttons 

uh I definitely think we should go like this 
And then changeable fonts 

Its the most important part  I think 

And the home base is something like that  something simple 

and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit 
Uh basic buttons  Onoff  mute  And th maybe two others  I dunno  Text buttons 

And then the colour buttons  if we want it on 
I dont find it very usable 

and then yeah we saw the the pla display  in the the iPod 
They can put the basic buttons  one  two  three  four  And uh f above ten 

Thats on on the display 

That th there is no display there 
But its on the place of the display 
And I think we should uh light this up much more than that part 
So the focus is on these two parts 
So you dont see all the buttons you else need 

But it sounds very difficult to use 
Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it 
So you cant use your thumb for it 

here we have also side scrolls 
I dunno if we can use that  Do we want to use

for volume  For volume  or a channel 

then we can even simplify it more 
By just putting the volume on the side 
And and just channel buttons here 

The channel buttons are often used 
And you cant use them now with your thumb 

m maybe we cho should put that on top 
and buttons we we dont use on  in the bottom 

Yeah  just th th th other buttons like text TV  Put that on the button bottom 

You mean uh these to the low 

Except from the onoff button 

But I I think w youll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons  like one two three 
So maybe we can put that on the bottom 

I think its pretty standard  these rubber buttons on the top 

I think its modern to light this area up  and to light this area up 

I think th the the top buttons are okay  They sh Those should be on top 
But uh we we can switch those two 

my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look  MP three player 

if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something  we I dont think we should put it on top then 
I think that  if were gonna put in more technology  that you need to be able to uh switch it open 

if you put in uh speech recognition  you need so more uh many more buttons 

the component design 
I looked at uh some similar devices  and uh my own common knowledge 

this was on the web site 
If you aim at a young public  you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green  blue  red  So flashy kinda colours 
Uh shapes should be curved  so round shapes  Not Nothing squarelike 

iPod is trendy 
And it is well curved square 

we shouldnt have too square corners and that kind of thing 

And um sports and gaming device style characteristics 

we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control 

the colours also 
So we have ha to ma make it in black  black  yellow 
Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black 

because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy  to attract a young public 

Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front 

Uh cant we use um different uh fron uh fronts  with all with the the logo on it  Can we do that  So

Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue

Still still transparent 

Yeah  But with all with logo on it 

Maybe we have to make it from soft material 

But anyways uh it should be transparent 

Just like a mobile phone  you can make um different fronts on it 

Just give five with them  just in a box  Five different

but y you could you could make em uh uh like blue and transparent 

Um the buttons  Normal rubber I think  Like normal ordinary buttons  Soft 

It it could be like a Nokia  like plastic 

With the hard hard buttons 

I think uh rubber really has an odd look 

The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls  uh the buttons are part of the uh the style  I think is part of the remote control itself 

it dont come out of the on the background 

its its all on one level 

So that should be hard plastic 

But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material 

basic remote control from normal plastic 
the rounds of it from softer s

The normal infrared LED I think s sufficient 
And back light LEDs 

But I think we have to make the case transparent 

Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh

but I think there are multiple colour LEDs 

And in green colour  the back lights

Just make it some different colours  Blue  red and green  or something 

Um this is the normal circuit board  like a chip board in in a lot of uh things 

So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators  Theres all these kind of things 
Um they they basically said that thats almost the same on any uh remote controls 

Uh the battery contacts  like normal batteries ca you can put in 

We still want to have a recharger  dont we 

Re recharger  Base station 

uh just just batteries  rechargeable batteries 

And uh a chip  thats this one 

Um for the energy source we can use batteries

or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch 

Or we can also use solar cells 
But you mostly use it indoors 

Its dark in the room 

Its just batteries 

and and we can use the home station kind of thing 
Um cases 
flat  so uncurved 
Uh two D curved is um like front to the back 
And three D curved is also in depth 

Uh but with three D uh curved uh remote controls  we must use rubber buttons 
So we cant use the flat buttons 

Um these kinda materials can be used 

we just make it plastic 

The scroll wheels  thats cool 
Thats for the volume 

And uh the LCD 

we need uh the expensive  most expensive chip  if we use an LCD 

I dont think thats an opportunity 

then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip  So th so the regular chip 

Uh are are we using a a rubber case 

Uh I dont think a rubber case looks

The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh 

fruit and veg can be just the covers 

I cant imagine a soft remote control 

Titanium  uh I think its too expensive 

just hard plastic 

Not the sh the square form 

you can make it curved or mm round 
But just in two D  not in depth 

more rounded 

We have to decide which one were going to choose from these  What exactly 

So the energy uh is the recharger 

Just a normal battery 

the case is just a plastic one 

Yeah th yeah  the chip is the the regular one 

And we need a plastic case  with a scroll wheel 

Uh ID and UID work together on prototype drawing on smart board 

Thats for the next one 

But you definitely get a specific instruction 
But th think about something thats more rounded 

Like a very big scrollwheel 

but just not on the top  but uh on the side of it 

I think uh youll get a a lot of uh volume changing when its not wanted 

maybe you just have to make it uh Thats not scrollable too easy 

Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom  and and the switch channel in the middle 

It doesnt make a difference  if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other 

I think uh zapping is the highest priority 

Uh but I think we we should bu uh put em on top of each other 

But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume  and top down is more with uh channel changing 

So so if we use that  they will probably have a long learning uh time 

we have to care that it r uh looks really new 
Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control 
Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scrollwheel on the outside 

but i i it should be round in in shape 

If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo 

You have to look at that image of the iPod 

Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then 

Yeah  five  Lets give five 

Maybe you can buy separate ones

uh buy the product  You buy  you get one  And uh basic 

y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger 

you could put it like that 

so top down 

Do we have to design that w as well 
The docking station 

But th Yeah  that can be very simple  Least 

But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well 

But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit 

As long as it isn is in two D we can use all kind of round shapes 

but we could do a lot of  lot more curving 

I dunno  I dunno if its handy 

I think it will only look more like the old remote controls 

we have to make a decision 
what kind of form its gonna have t going to have 

I think if w My opinion  If we just uh take the iPod  and the same look 
So uh light or just whatever colour  but the same light colours 
And uh just with uh together with uh the backlights b look will look very new 

And you have the scroll button inside 

Just together with the backlights youll get a totally new look  More like the MP three player M um P M P three player 

No rubber buttons or something 

But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then 

Doesnt have to be 

though thats a trend  If we want to make it 

I think its okay if you just keep it a bit square 

I d I dont know n something about ergonomic kind of fitsinthehand uh stuff 

Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha whats it called uh scroll wheel  Make it in in yellow or something  Just like the colours of Real Reaction 

We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition 

do we s keep that 

But youd definitely need a
advanced chip 

And we we have to build in a microphone

I d I didnt receive any information on speech recognition 

Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well 

Probably we need a uh advanced chip then 

But we dont have any f information about the cost 

Yeah  uh I have I have some some information about the cost  But just a about the chip 

our division has developed a new speech recognition feature  the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit 
This is a very small electronic unit 
will give a standard answer after it recognise a question 

Just You say record  followed by your question sample  and after a few seconds the answer uh sample 

it works like uh good morning remote control 
and then the remote control says good morning 

thats integrated in the chip 

but if we use speech recognition  that will be in it as well 

it it would be would be a good feature feature 

We have to stop it now
