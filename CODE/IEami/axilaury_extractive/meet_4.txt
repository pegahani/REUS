Matthew is uh late again 

it is important for him to be here uh 

but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer  I think we can put on the here 

we will just we just have to continue 

just for record I I will take uh notes again 

first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again
that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents 
when you stay in its good 
when you dont stay in you have to redesign 

maybe Anna  you can have your presentation 

we cant do evaluation til we have a design 

Matthew  Nice uh you are here 

ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs 

I will start by the the basic one
that uh fits into uh eight Euros actually  right  seven eight Euros 

first for both they have um a special shape 

but uh its like a surf board 

And also its not too far from um a mobile 
So people are used to that kind of shape 

Dont take care too much about the colour

Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now 

the onoff button  in red 
Here would be the volume  On the on the left 

so you can go up and down the channels 
uh  if you have a video or something you can forward  back 

How can you change from VCR to uh TV  by the way 

this is a standard TV one 

and then we have usually there twelve keys
but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits 
The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel 
And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that  Actually 
Its a very basic minimal thing

Exce except for the for the special shape  the surfing board  it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh 

uh i i i it is a very futuristic 
its like uh its like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future  it can come 

Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone 

then the this is the a more a little uh smooth
and it gives a lot of functionality  uh in this way 

uh th you see there are only six keys 

they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here 
And so they have more space actually
and uh its easy to uh use this

and then you have a power button  which l volume  what you have 
and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo

Play  pause 

yeah s pause or stop 

you have a LCD display  here
and uh y this is a functional thing
which can change

its a toggle switch
which could change the function

From DVD player to television or something 

and and and then you get feedback via the LCD

you can have a integrated microphone over here 

This is the orange button  the microphone 

you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display 
And here is a small LED

which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery 
and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier

then we have a cover

when you need you can use it 
and this gives additional functionality

but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed  will it also uh cover up the LCD screen 

Yeah 

Actually when you are watching the TV  when you are watching anything or listening to them  you hardly care about what is getting displayed here 

and this gives a protection to the LCD actually  giving a cover to that actually  Gives a protection

Its low weight  You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight 
So the the cost is actually a bit more 

Sixteen Euros 

So its well outside the budget then 

But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer 
And they say basically that the SR system would be uh something like three Francs per item

Three Euros 

Thats on top of the sixteen 
or is it part of that 

part of that  yeah 

So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition 

if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys

we should stick with uh a number of keys

it it should not be cluttering up everything 

I like the shape of them 
I do like the the size and the the shape 

Be before ta talking about the money and whats possible and what is not possible  maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um

And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products  both of these two 

and also the evaluation criteria  so what what is important to look at 

its just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that weve identified as being important to selling the product 
Um we just go through these
and rate them as a group
and then at the end well make an evaluation based on that 

These are the things we identified as being important 
Um the three things were look and feel  innovation and ease of use  were the three important components
um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic 
And then goin following the company motto  following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well 

do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now
or do we wanna discuss them further
and then evaluate them 

why not why not discuss uh discuss it now 

just go through onto the whiteboard I guess 

look and feel  innovation

And now it easy to use 

you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these 

w w we can still discuss that 

and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas

um Ive received uh a framework which we can do this 

the first one was really very far below budget 
would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that
or just have the high profit on it 

my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it 

because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros

this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components 
so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh 

Th th this is the first design 

Um w ones bad
and sevens the best 

ones true
and sevens false 

Look and feel 

In i in my opinion purely feel is is is very good  is very good in your hand 
so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel 

we should also consider look 
and then i it looks quite conventional 

On the scale u its between functional and fancy basically were looking at 

Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five

but uh still I will give four in that case

the way we have designed its like the surf as you say

we we designed the two uh items 

If you press like this not like this

C can you get the batteries 

isnt it the ink 

I think its lost a battery 

Because well be able to see it still even if it wasnt working 

but it wouldnt be picked up on the the actual whiteboard 
And the other one 

I think its slightly better  um 

which which ll be covering in a curve

actually this is this is not going to protrude actually 

The other thing is  is the left hand one protruding 
Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand 
maybe it wont work so well 

Id say two or three for that one  personally 

So so I would also say this is four 

because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this  now its embedded one 

So I will say two 

its d its definitely more fancier than that one 

Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market 

No but except for the design of the surf 

Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it 

I think its more of the feel 

But th is there any theres no actual innovation in that at all 

And the And the second one is really uh state of the art  uh in terms of innovation 

So Id be up for seven for innovation 

And um with many more functionalities 
and can open and close the the bottom part 

And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this 

A and the LCD screen is
Thats thats thats well its quite innovative 

Uh could put it at one or two I would say  Personally 

Th th there were different options we discussed then 
we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget 

and then we will will try to get it in the budget 

We just diske discuss it as you designed it

Innovation for this one is two  One 

the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it 

then its I think one 

Ease of use 

the first one is really standard 
so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it 

So thats maybe a a two for ease of use 

Um  the other one is quite easy  tho though 

Uh  though it has more functionality

So maybe a three or a four 

maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons 

because its n uh its not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so 

actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually 

So so I think th three is good  Yeah 

uh how well it goes to the target demographic 

were d were still thinking twenty to forty year olds 

I would I would give this model to the old people actually 

So sh completely changed our demographic there 

exce except for the surfing shape  I mean thats thats something which which has an appeal on this group I think 

If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being applying to the the demographic

Mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance  making this more attractive to to the demographic

Cause we have got room  weve got some budget there to add a few things to it 

But as it is now  I w would say mm  six  something 

because its so important its i it was written that it really so important  the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets  the right range of people 

but but if you sell it in the market its going to be cheap  actually 

we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros 

Theres nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one 

So in that case well its fine then 

and the demokraphi demographic of the second one 
Its got the got the the toys in it 
its got the LCD screen

if we we wish to to sell four millions of this  I think for this audience we need absolutely the LCD screen 

I think especially if were gonna n have an LCD screen on a low range product then thats good 

Id probably go with three again for that one 

Or even Even one and two  Or two 

Yeah two yeah 

because you can add lot of sophistication on that 

And especially I guess cause this has the speech recognition as well 
and that makes it more appealing 

the final point  trends 

the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel 

as it is  not really doing either of them 

Spongy  uh  that means that it goes in in the water 

the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well 

have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons

that feels kinda spongy 

but Im thinking one of the Nokias thats got like you ca it hasnt got individual buttons

Yeah  We we we we we yeah  its the way they are going to be  actually 

the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie 

But thats if youre using the covers 

uh uh is it possible do you think  to to make a cover for s such a phone 

they make it for mobiles 
it cant be that much more complicated 

just with the with the flexible plastic uh

So you got the option of having different colours or different textures 

Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone  yeah 

we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance  to to these covers

I think the if we do the cover thats really going with the companys philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics 

even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out  youll still be able to put a new cover on it

look at this computer  th this laptop  its all black 
and uh its quite conventional 
and sometimes people dont like too much flashy colours like this one presented here 
So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one  very standard one  that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things 

And then you have the option of having the different colours  different covers 

Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um on the other one 

Cause thats the thats the feature that could be included in either of them 

Say  say one and two  One and two 

the average of that is three six nine divided by five  so five mm nine by five  one point s eight 

One point eight yeah 
Four point Uh four point two 

Very good 

But we still got a very different price for those two
so theyre not really comparable yet anyway 

or we just have to choose  And adapt 
Because  when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive

We we must try to get them closer 

its easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out 
Thatll basically take us down to the budget 

Uh unfortunately we didnt see this chip  uh Matthew 
so maybe we have to recap with this one 

and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap 

lets lets try to to model this this phone in this sheet 

Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this  yeah 

uh what kind of energy source uh

Its a its a normal battery  or

maybe you might use a AA battery actually 

given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip 

Uh sample speaker  yeah 

Double curve 

Uh  plastic would be the material 

Are you talking about this or that 

but they have the same shape 

Uh special colour  now we leave it to the covers 

now were either going button or LCDs  LCD display 

Its okay  Just say LCD 

So it would need twelve buttons 

we might need a scroll wheel  right  for that 

but for this one its twelve Euro 

So this comes to eighteen 

And thats without any special button supplements 

wed have a special colour  special form and special material on all of them 

its not its not double curved 
its single curved 

its like its curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well  thats what I thought 

weve got those the scroll wheel on the side

Im Im no Im no Im not sh sure 

The bt buttons  we have twelve buttons  are you sure 

Weve got a scroll wheel for the volume

this is even more than the um than the cost you gave  the sixteen Euros 

That is the sample sensor and sample speaker 
We just need that actually  We need one 

We We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip 
but then we cant have the the speech recognition 

this would this would be cutting the speech recognition 

but if you have the near the LCD you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio  TV and VCR 
and this needs a needs a advanced chip 

I think yeah regular  today we you can do that with regular chip 

and we still on fifteen 

And what about the number of buttons buttons uh my Matthew 

when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty 

But thats seven basic buttons right  seven buttons without any addson  without special colours or form or material 

the LCD display is is three Francs  sorry three Euros  by itself 

We we really want a LCD
other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market 

So were gonna have to scale this down to get within budget 

So wha what what each of us think about the because its measure point the LCD  um

Or we could even replace them by buttons actually 

Because sometimes whe when you watch the TV in fact  you have a big display

A actually it depends  it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it 
for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons 
or and youll have LCD display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least 

I think  unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the LCD display 

Okay so we can get rid of it
and then add a couple of buttons 

and its looking like we cant afford the LCD display  theres no way we can get it in there 

S so who thinks the the LCD disply display should be i should be in it 

I th Id like t it to be in but I cant see it happening  I cant see it fitting in 

having an LCD s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons 

So hav hav having seven buttons  instead of twelve 

uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons
and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here  Here one  at the middle  and at the bottom 

I I think we should we should cut the LCD screen  That thats thats my opinion 

The speech recognition is out  Because of the budget  yeah 

are we basically back to the original one now  back to the first version 
Which turns out to be on budget exactly  pretty much  With these new costings 

and that that now twelve Euros is the is is the price 

My m my supervisor will be glad that its fifty cents cheaper than he expected 

w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe
and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in
but thats all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment 

Thank you 
That was it 

Thanks
