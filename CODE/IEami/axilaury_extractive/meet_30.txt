Uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one 

And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control 
And we have think I got a new project requirement 
So I think uh teletext becomes outdated 

and I think we dont need lighting adaptive 

So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet 

so the remote control should be only used for the the television 
And of course we should have our image in the in the design 
So  lets start with the the industrial designer 

Right  so um I will talk about the the w working design and
And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television 

So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do 

I think uh I Ill do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market
and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use 
Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype

And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that 
And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that 

So  wha what I think for now is we dont want to have a remote control w which is wired
so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the 
Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication 
And the communication with the TV set is uh made through uh infrared communication
So uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls
so uh you can you can see the components  uh battery
and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the TV set 
The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities

One is a communication 

and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well  putting things together 
um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the TV set 

I think we should use a FPGA for for the functionalities which is easy to to t

What is FPGA 

Its a field programmable gateway arrays 

So whys it how is it different from the Bluetooth 

Well  uh a FPGA is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want 
And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices 

So this are the they have to work together 
Or  Do they have to work together or two separate choice

Well  th the FPGA will produce the the data to send 

Or its something like isnt hardware the first one 
And the second one is for the software 

Okay  and how about the battery power 
Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared 

I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the

And uh I I dont think it will need um very uh much power to make it run  so

Mm  You can put it on the charger when uh you when you dont need to use it 

Its a good idea 

Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always 
People dont like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out 
We just make a small charger

Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth  if some people have PDA they can use their PDA to control the TV if they want to  right 

we do not want to make it PDA 

Also  but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control 

So Im working on the technical functions design 
So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have 
So so I found on a webs on the internet

and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set 
For example switch on  switch off  switch the next channel and so on and so on 
So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors

This are usual functionality 

Ours is a bit uh different 
So these are two example 
One is from
the other one is from  yeah  uh engineering centr yeah 
This is the most competing prototypes Ive found 
But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons

And they are small 

O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number
so its very lousy 
So you so you move to the next the next one 

And then I I look at the user manual
they are a hundred pages thick 
so we dont want that 
So I propose the easy to use uh prototype 
You can navigate on TV screen

and we need to have the TV connected to internet so we end in order to access the TV programmes by XML
and we need some to do some preprocessing 
From the technical aspect  the processing should be done on the TV set than on the on the remote controller  right 
And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may KIV 

What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the TV

Yeah  all the processing is done the TV is a compu has some processing power the

So we should have specific TV 

We have to sell a TV with the remote control too 

Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay 

I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the TV set on recorders or thing like that
and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because

So I come up with a simple design 
just keep the v navigation buttons 

Yes  thats a good idea  I think 
We d we dont we we dont need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the TV so uh
Well  f four five buttons  its sufficient 
Its easy to build 
it does not consume much power 

Oh  but you have a catch there 
um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine  then 

Well  then y you you go to the main menu
and uh you have uh go to channel

No  because you choose by channel 

so you dont have hundred channels to choose from 

but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could

but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right  left  up  down 
well  the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator  maybe directly  or

we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that 

Uh its gonna be small 

So itll beep if you wanna find it

too small that it goes under the sofa and we cant find it 

you just uh shout y h just
it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device 

just give it a name and we call him 

And responds to you  and

Okay  after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface  I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here 
And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested  then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines 
and the users send the feedbacks 
and based on that These are the findings which we got
and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a TV remote

Well I I think it will be a  yes  a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts

But I think if you to recognise numbers its a wellstudied problem 
I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary

Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones 

And this can allow to choose the the program  for instance without uh adding uh buttons

Its going to be very slim 

its not going to take much space also 

It has to be of course a very slim and small one 

And next one was the size of the remote control 

And of course most of the people are interested in if its less expensive 

I mean we have to look for a tradeoff 
The features and the cost 

I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost 
Maybe not less  but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort 

Little bit more if its with extra features 

Yeah  s s speech is a important extra feature I think

I mean  for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes 

but only for the numbers on the channel  or volume up  volume down  brightness  contrast 

And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages 

we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control  so

What about lighting adaptive options 

Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting  but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if its not really required 

According to the re to the new requirements I think we dont need that 

but its quite possible
but maybe not in this project 

So any things to to discuss 

I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing 
The speech interface
and uh less uh reasonable uh cost 
And the lighting adaptation
and the teletext 
And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions 
If you are watching an foreign movie  you get subtitles sometimes 
And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French 
And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German 
So  the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages 

Yeah  but well what about the the new projects requirement 
I I I think we should give up with teletext  no 

Well  so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television 

Yeah  but uh we can think that in a few years there will be TV set that can access the internet 
So its a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years 

So you have to anticipate the the future 

well  not not to implement it 
but to well  to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah  in an in an easy manner  if is possible 

Yeah  Because all the TV sets will be digital  right 

Okay  So lets go for the the lunch break 
and we will meet after
