Um this is the kickoff meeting for the day 
Um were the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction 
As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting 
um become acquainted with each other 
um have a little training on tools 
uh create a plan 
discuss things
and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total 

The new remote control is to be original  trendy and userfriendly 
That  Steph  is your part  is the userfriendliness 
The originality um is gonna take all of us 
Um the trendiness well probably go look at for some marketing research information from you  Sarah 

well have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design 

Everybodys supposed to try out the whiteboard 
Kate  why dont you try it first  if you can either bring your things with you  I guess

well try and figure out how to hook these things on as well 
cause were all gonna have to be able to walk around 

you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal 

Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat 

I think its to get us used to using the pen 

Not a mouse  a rat 

a fish 

And I think your pens running out of whatever 

we have to get down to the nittygritty of how to make this
and this remote control has to be sold um were to sell it for twenty five Euros 
with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros 
That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale 

would be like what  a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million 
Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item 

if they cost twelve and a half  youre selling it for twenty five  youre making twelve and a half Euros each 
Um and were to make a profit of fifty million 

I was just wondering if thats the um If fifty percent is normal

Um I would think would be more like sixty percent 

you gotta know how many were going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that 

In order to make fifty million Euros  and youre only getting twelve and a half each

four million  Youd have to sell four million 

Experience with a remote control 
Any of you use of remote control for a television or DVD or something 

That that thats the sorta product were talking about  one that will work for a in a home environment  for a TVs and

Ive seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time 
but I also have heard about them not working well or not well coordinated
and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another 

that you always sit around you know  youre sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something  theres five different remotes  and one for the DVD and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else 

And they dont always talk to each other 

But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television 

We could make a Hello Kitty
themed remote 

I think one in b bright colours would be good 

I think one that works would be good 

We could totally go for the Japanamation 

I mean theres also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products 

I think one that doesnt have lots of superfluous functions 
Like Ive got one at home
that has well  apart from the obvious  channels  channel up  channel down  volume 
you know  subtitles  mute  theres a lotta buttons that Ive got no idea what they do  like 

thats a really good point 
because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate  we tend to um go to menus and then make choices 

so if its like an uh volume button  you know  you can go in and say mute or or volume 
We dont need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down 
Mm  We can make it smart like an iPod 

make everything menus 

closing the meeting 

Um I know this sounds like it was very quick 

I think thats the industrial design is the first one 
thats Kate  for the working design 
And user  thats you S Steph  for the technical functions design 
and for marketing the user requirements specification 

we have to help each other
and work through this as a group 

Uh as it says  were gonna get individual instructions 

and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now
