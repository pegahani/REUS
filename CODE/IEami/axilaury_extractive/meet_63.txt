Weve got a cool prototype 

everything uh that we wanted
we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber 

Double curved 

um but also something that was gonna jump out at people 

So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand  youll see what a nice thing we have going here 
So  basically  if you hold it like that  the one on your thumb  yeah  the thumb button is the power button 
Your index finger is channel up  middle finger is channel down 

Um and then then you can also theres a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want 

but we think its very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different 

That certainly does 

I have one thing about it  but its a small thing 
but itd mean wed have to make a righthanded one and a lefthanded one 
But  thats I dont see why thats not possible 

like I was just thinking if theres lefthanders and righthanders in the family  what  they have two remotes 

Yeah  I know I know people who have lefthanded and righthanded people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse  and everybody is using righthanded mouse 

I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so

But we can have both uh

Have them in stock 

I think its  well  if the RR motto is  we bring fashion to to electronics  Id say that could be quite fashionable 

And its got the b the black and yellow and blue 

One thing I do need to do we need to look at  is the costs 

I could do you know  I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you 
but its just easy enough to go through it with you 
so were going for the kinetic power 

So the case  weve gone for the double curved 

and its made out of rubber 

well theyre in diff special colours 

Special form 

Were under budget 

Thats gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make 
And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty 

so we evaluate each criteria 

And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven 
one being true  so its its more like its fits the criteria 
and seven being as in it doesnt fit the criteria 

So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about 

I would give it a seven 

As in its not 

Oh sorry  one  d yeah 

Second criteria  new technology 

Well  the kinetic thing  yeah 

w every everything else was fairly simple  but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new 

Maybe three  yeah 

So criteria three is is it easy to use 

not if youre lefthanded its not 

If were gonna have one lefthanded and one righthanded then I would give it a one  but otherwise otherwise a two 

Kay  criteria four is costs 

Its come in under budget 
So thats a definite one 
Amount of buttons 
Contains only the necessary buttons 

RSI is it good against 
Yes  Very good 

does it get lost 

I dont think its gonna get lost easily 

But it is smallish 

I mean  you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically  but

Weve  weve done well 

So thats the evaluation 

Number one product 

Okay  I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know  little bit of praise for everybody here for how theyve worked on it 

during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion 
but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and

um and then come together and worked in  you know  integrally  you know  at the right times 

and be you know  has been good communication going on 

Now you guys have been a a great team 

and I think weve co we have come weve come up with something new  something that hasnt been done before 

I think when this meetings finished like officially  there b well get a uh questionnaire to fill in 

I mean  since we saved on the on the production cost  do we know how much were making on profit 

I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh  you know  after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote  you know 

Um how does everyone feel about the technology thats been used in this 
The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that 

I love it  I love it  I think its cool 

Um  but a p a pen with a camera on it  I dont think its such a new thing 

It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff  but as its not
its literally thatll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text 

I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that  its just the first step
