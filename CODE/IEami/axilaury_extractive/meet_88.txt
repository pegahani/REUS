Right  so agenda of the first meeting 
Where we uh We have twenty five minutes for this meeting 
We uh are to get acquainted 
So does everyone want to say who they are 

Im Robin 
Im the Marketing Manager 

Im Louisa 
Im the User Interface Designer 

Im Nick 
I am the Industrial Designer 

And Im Alastair
and Im the project leader 

So does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required 

so tool training 

Project plan 

Im not exactly sure what you mean by tool training 

Neither am I 

So we have the project team  which is to um basically to come up with a new r remote control device 

And uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one 
and to to be trendier  to be with it 
and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience 

method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh the functional design  the conceptional design  and the detailed design
in each of these uh phases well uh basically be handing over to yourselves  the designers of this uh this device 
And uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before 

So weve got tool training 
Try out whiteboard 

Right so everyones to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there 
I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works 

Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever 

I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat 

Um and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um I dunno maybe because theres so many cartoon characters made up after the bear

Um Im gonna go for the dog 

So what my daughters have got at the moment is theyve got uh a few fish
and so hopefully um wont prove too difficult to draw 

Work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price 

So were looking to sell internationally  not just in Europe 
Were looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit 
And therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin its uh because obviously youre gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit 
And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units were uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time 

Experience with remote control  first ideas  New remote 
So I guess were looking at um having a discussion at this point in time

So uh any any thoughts 

Um I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small

so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons 

Okay  so so basically were looking for some um were looking for a device that is um robust
and and therefore uh wont get damaged too easily 

Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible 

Is this just a television remote 
Because a lot of um systems are kind of TV video combined now 
or TV DVD combined 
And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house 
So if youve got a combined system  it could be a combined remote 

basically Ill get back to you on that 

Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well 

Or is it just a television that were supposed to be doing 

cause as you rightly said  theres nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room 

So a device for for all remotes 

And um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose
because youre sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room 

we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room 

Comes to your whistle 

Thats thats maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television  but

Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote 

I mean weve done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are 

Next meeting in thirty minutes 

You cant have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to
cause you want you want simplicity as well 

Whilst at the same time you want  as you rightly said  one remote for all 
And so these are probably mutually exclusive options

you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes 

So its possible that we could devise a system where where youre youre basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television  your stereo 

Okay  so weve got um the working design for ID 
For UID the technical functions design 
Marketing  the user requirement specification 
Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach 

And I guess Ill try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting 

Im not exactly clear on what were designing the rem remote for 
Is this a mun multifunctional one

I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control 
so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise 

Thats true 
cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where were going 
But at this point in time I think youre right that uh shall we make it just a TV
