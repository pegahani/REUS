Um its our conceptual design meeting

our agenda 

Im gonna review the minutes of the last meeting 
then well have your three presentations um
and then well have to make a decision on the remote control concepts 

Um these are our minutes from r the functional design 
We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it 

and we said its for all age groups  different um functions of it 
Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion 

specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost  large buttons for the essential functions  a possibility for extra functions  like a sliding a sliding piece and a longlife battery or a charging station 

Id like to do it in this order  first do the conceptual specification of components  properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching 

Components design 

The main elements of remote controls in general  and therefore ours as well  are the case  the buttons  the circuit board with the chip and the battery 

um theres theres the shape of a case  we could do a flat sh a flat case  a curved case or maybe even a double doublecurved case 
uh the options that Ive gotten from headquarters about what we can do 
I havent seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet 

and we can make our case out of plastic  the m the main base will be plastic 
but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in  wood  latex  titanium  rubber or other coloured types of plastic 

for buttons we have um pushbuttons 

but we also have scror scroll wheels 
which can have integrated pushbuttons 

and have an L LCD screen 

or we could go all hightech

Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one  a regular one or an advanced one 

And then battery I think is where things get most exciting 

Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A batteries 
but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery 

Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery 
Or a solar battery 
although there are slight um complications with solar batteries
as in we cant use a latex case if we have a solar battery 
Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago  flashlights 

Um personal preferences that I was thinking through
heres what weve been talking about all through  fashion and simplicity 
So if were going for fashion in our cases  I think that what were gonna wanna look at is a curved or a doublecurved case  probably with a variety of design elements 
Maybe titanium 
maybe some wood 
Were gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials 

And we wanna go for simplicity 
Probably pushbuttons 
but Im sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel  if anyone has anything

And Im really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery 

But I think wed also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip
to keep our costs down 
Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if were gonna start using an LCD 

Solar I dont think would be such a good idea 

Is doublecurved like would be like two hands kind of thing 

Im not sure 

but Ill let you know as soon as I get any pictures 
I know if we do have a doublecurved case  it cant have any titanium in it 

um the weight of these different elements  have you

no idea  no idea 
Um Im assuming that a kinetic battery isnt gonna take up that much weight 

but if anyone has any specific questions  dont hesitate to email me or something 

Im gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device 

so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are

We have a number of different choices for a design concept um

Uh once weve chosen a a concept for it  we can then design the features around the concept 

M we dont want lots of buttons  uh complicated features 

Heres a a fairly simple device 
This is an an iPod from Apple 

Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small LCD screen 

So I think thats thats a good a good kind of model that we could have  Um
heres a another example 

and I think i it looks pretty cool 

Uh its nice and colourful  its nice and bright 

if youre watching TV in the dark or whatever  you can work out which buttons which

I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often 

wed either have a small LCD display on the device itself 
or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television

theres no point having a television that you cant tune or that you cant set the contrast 
so we need to find a way of including these somehow 

So youd be advocating an LCD then 

I think thats thats one way to go 

Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an LCD display 

an an LCD display would have to be quite small 

Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it 

The alternative is to have a an onscreen display on your television that you control through your remote control  Uh

but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where its um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it 

I think I think were talking menu like contrast and tuning the VCR or something if Ive understood you correctly  rather than menu as whats on 

were gonna look a little bit at trend watching 

that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted 
and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year 

and right now i d theyre saying that currently theres a functional look and feel preference 
but that really  over the next year it it thats gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes 

theyre sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that its fancy look and feel 
And as these are ranked  the top one is doubly important to the second one 
which is doubly important to the third one 

The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations 

And then ease of use was the third most important 

And then the fashion watch talks about that this years top trend for clothes 
shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that theres a preference for spongy  tight material 
And so that brings us to my personal preferences 
Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding 
Personally  I dont really think that I want one thats gonna go out of style or go stale  excuse the pun  um in a year  so

and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking 

Also  considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction  Im a little hesitant as to like  how these questions may have been worded 

but if were working for this company then I guess no matter what  we have to stress fashion the most 

Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these  Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all 

could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote 

If its latex if its latexy

my understanding of a latex case is that its in fact hard to protect stuff inside 

theres something to be said  I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to R R repetitive stress injuries and things

Im envisioning more like  you know  the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle 

could we go in fruit and vegetable colours 

um couple main ones being like  I dunno  lemons or strawberries or something 

I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable  Uh like uh I dunno  like uh carrots or something 

Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits 

What about the idea of like a round remote  Instead of like a vertical up and down one  Like in terms of holding it  Like thats a f shape of a fruit 

would you think you you do you think youd be able to hold it 

I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod 

or is it li more like a scroll thing 

and you press the centre button 
thats thats your allpurpose select button right there 

I think why it would be good for us is cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume 

I think an LCD screen might be good in theory  but not as useful in practice 

Um Ive one more slide before we close 
but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things 

Could Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile  In different fruit and vegetable colours 

and then like the the covers could be spongy latex

components concept  Energy  chip on print 

can you just explain what that is real quick 

what do people think about this kinetic battery idea 

I think its awesome  I think its really cool 

as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is 

I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced 

which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us 

Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same  I think 

I dont really know what to tell you as far as decisions 

I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple  a regular  or an advanced chip  maybe 

if were gonna have pushbuttons  they require a simple chip 
but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip 

Do we want a scroll wheel 

Um I dont think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel 

It would be nice for changing the volume 
but I dont know how useful itd be for changing the channel 

you really need buttons for changing a channel 

We have five minutes left for the meeting  so 

and the volume would just be like the same way  forward and backward as Im just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking 

When you get on the onscreen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus 

I think yeah  I think a scroll wheel would be nice 
but its not necessary  Um

Uh Im kinda liking the idea of latex  if if spongy is the in thing 

could it be hard  and then something around it 

I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing 

what Ive seen  just not related to this  but of latex cases before  is that theres uh like a hard plastic inside  and its just covered with the latex 

Um and probably in colours  maybe fruity  vegetable colours 

and we want a curved case 

Or a doublecurved 

Um And I think if we wanna keep our costs down  we should just go for pushbuttons 

For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPods kind of scroll thing would be too fast 

I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case

I mean Im not like hardsold on the scroll wheel 
its more just to give it a different kind of look 

were gonna go with um type pushbuttons 
and then supplements 

So were gonna have like a menu button 

were doing an onscreen menu that we can scroll through 

uh volume  favourite channels  uh and menu 

Preset channels

I think maybe numbers seems is kind of oldfashioned 

finishing the meeting now 
Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes 
um you each have things to do  look and feel design  user interface design  product evaluation 
and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay 
Youll get specific instructions from your personal coach 

Lets go with a simple chip 

Um did we decide on a chip 

but if its gonna be in a latex type thing and thats gonna look cool  then thats probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel
