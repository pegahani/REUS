The first kickoff meeting 

First the opening 
then the rest 

We m have to make a new remote control 
It has to be original  trendy and userfriendly 
So we will get back th on that 
First we have to make a functional design 
After that we have to make a conceptual design 
and then after that a detailed design 
So well discuss that later 

So first to we have to make a small painting 

First you can save the documents 
We have to do that every time we make something 

And we have to use the pen and the eraser 

We all have to use this one 

So Ill make an example 

Um you can change some things 
Um format  line  and change it 
And you can change the colour 

So and after it you have to save it 

An elephant 

So youre next 

Uh a bird 

Now save 

Okay 

Now next  The budget 

we will sell the t at twenty five Euros 
And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it 

First I wanna hear from you 
Uh what are your experiences with remote controls 

Big one  they are uh not easy to use 

And uh g big buttons 
m uh thats easier to use than uh I think 

Big buttons  positive 

Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that its it it has an influence on the TV set 
And that it controls the channels and the the volume 
And uh I I I think its positive if theres a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote 

And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light  and uh and you see that its working 

But I my my experience is that it it its convenient to have that 

Uh at home we have a TV  a video uh recorder  a DVD player  and a satellite receiver 
We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that 
Thats not really ea easy 
So it would be nice if we have one for all 

For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it 
So what ideas do you have for it  for the new remote control 

The weight  Not not too heavy 
Not much buttons 

That when you drop it  it wont break 
Like uh some kind of rubber on it 
Or hard uh hard plastic 

Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control  sometimes it happen  Uh it between the couch and you cant find it 
When you push a but a button on the TV  then you hear some uh some sort of bleep 

Yeah well thats that are good ideas  Uh

And looking on the budget  not too expensive uh material 
So probably plastic or something  Uh

Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view  it also has to look nice 

on our website we can see what products we already have 
And it should work with as many uh as possible of them 

Uh it it wont take a lot of batteries 
So you dont wont have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks 

Its only the first ideas 

uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour 

Um  what you have to do  Well look on your 

And Next instructions youll get in your email  So
