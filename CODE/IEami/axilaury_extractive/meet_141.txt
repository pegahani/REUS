So welcome back 

first  I want to say Im the secretary 
so I make the minutes 
You find them in your in the map in the From the group 
Theres the minutes from the first meeting 
Youll find the next minutes also there 

I wanna hear from you  what youve done 
And after that I have some new product requirements  So
And after that we have to make decisions  what we will do 

We have forty minutes for this meeting 
After that well have lunch 
So first I wanna ask the Industrial Designer to tell what he did  So

Where have I put it 

Ive save it on my computer  my presentation 

But now I dont know where it is 

Okay here it is 

Its a little difficult what Im gonna tell you 
Its about the working of the remote control 
I just had an half an hour j to study it
and I dont get it 

First uh I will tell you something about the findings 
what I discovered about the remote control 

Uh then Ill have uh some kind of map 
and its the top of the remote control 

The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who havent seen a remote control uh inside 
Uh theres a lot of uh plastic on it 
um because its uh not so expensive 
And there are uh a lot of uh wires 
uh which um connect the components in it 

and there are um switches and things like that 
Theres a lot of small uh electronics 
So it wont be um uh too expensive to build it 
Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it 

And here I have the top of the remote control 
Uh heres some kind of chip 
Uh on top of this  there are uh the numbers 
Uh you have all on your remote control 
And uh the teletext uh button 
And uh heres the battery 
And when you push the button  it will uh will be sent to the chip 
And the chip will um send it to all kind of subcomponents 

My preferences 

We shouldnt make it too big 
Uh also for the cost  uh we should only put one battery on it 
A longlasting battery 
Uh also for the cost  uh use only plastic 

Also because of the cost  uh not too much buttons on it 
We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button 
And then um that that you will see it on the TV 

And the bleep signal  y uh you told us 
Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something  when the batterys empty  then there is a bleep 

And also the bleep  when what I told you about uh when you lost it 
and you push a button  and then you hear bleep bleep  and we will find it 

The battery 
You say one battery is cheaper 

If we w if we use only just one uh small penlight  then it will be cheaper than when we use two 

when you use two  you can use it two times longer 

then well have to make the um remote control uh long lasting 

Okay and the buttons 
When you use it on the television  youve you need the television  wh which can use it 

But uh I think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company 
Or is it also for other company uh for other televisions 

I think we have to use it also on other televisions though 

Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions 

They are two different things though 
We have to choose one 
It has to work on o uh all televisions 

Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions 

And I just uh have one more idea 

But Uh  to have a trendy remote control  we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones  To change covers 
So if you have uh a trendy half with all red  uh yellow and something  And then you can put a red cover on it 

Will this will this add to the cost 

Uh then it wont be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one 
And then you can buy the covers 

but you have to m uh be able to change it 
D does it make it more difficult to design 

I think it will be a little more difficult 
but not too much 
Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones 

Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones 

If it wont works then well get something else 
Then we uh wont g uh go further with it 

Yeah but are their profits bigger than their cost 

Uh a p a a cover made in uh in China  it it wont be I guess so expensive I think 

Yeah but there are also design cost 

Would you change the cover 

I wi I wont 
But maybe I think trendy people
or like children where you can paint on it 

I think that too less people would change it for good profit  So

Im not sure if it will make profit enough to uh
But its uh yeah its uh original idea 

but I dont think we have to do it 

Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design 
Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the TV set 

And uh well  it all by pushing a button on the remote 

Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web 

Uh message to the television 
And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off  and uh switching channels  and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that 

well these are two uh remotes 
and thats our uh our dilemma I think  Uh

But uh shall we make a basic remote control  uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more 
Or uh uh more functions on the remote 
Uh maybe more devices you can influence 
Uh a radio or a v a video recorder  uh VCR 

Um any ideas about that 
Basic or multifunctional 

Well got back on that later 

So uh I didnt know what uh what way we would go 

Then its your turn  the marketing expert 

So Im uh gonna have a presentation about um the market 

Uh we did a usability labtest with a hundred persons 
And we looked at uh several um things 
Uh among them design 

uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls 

Uh our users  they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls 
Um uh they especially found found them very ugly 
And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it 
Uh well they also zap a lot 

And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons 
So a lot of unused buttons 

Well uh the most used button is the channel selection 

The power  volume and channel selections are very relevant 
Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important 
Uh not important they found the audio 
uh thats not the volume but uh specific the the pitch  or the left or right 
Uh the screen and the brightness  And uh channel settings  Uh th and they also are not used very often 

Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups 

Then we have a few um graphs about the market 

Um as you can see  most users are uh between thirty six and forty five 
Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big 
And to come back on the the swapping uh things  uh I dont think uh  I I think the younger will be most interest in it 

Um in the we asked them  uh how would you like a s a new feature 
If you have an LCD on the remote control  what would you think of it 
Now you can clearly see young users say  I will that would very nice 
And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think 

And another thing  how would you like to have a speech recognition on it 

Young users uh think thats an interesting idea 
And old users not 
Uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim 
Uh the first are the younger 

the age between sixteen and forty five 

Uh they are highly interested in the features  as you can see uh here 

Uh the second group is the older group 
Aged between forty six and sixty five 

They are less interested in uh new features 
But uh they spend their money more easily 

Well then I come to my uh personal preferences 
Uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at 
Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesnt say that old people wont buy it 

What I thought  um even young people say its hard to use  remote control 
So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use  thats especially aimed at this group  even uh the young group will also be more interested 

But when use it  uh I dont know whats uh good thing of speech recognition 

Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control 

You can find most functions on a TV set 
So uh you dont have to have a lot of audio options  or screen options to change the brightness  And such things 

One thing I did not say I think  is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one 

So the design of our remote control is very important 

If we aim for the younger people  um and there will be uh a lot of features like LCD or the the the speech uh f recognising  uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher 
Uh I think we dont have that in our budget 

And I dont uh I dont think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something 
So its Yeah  its hard to uh get the younger group 

I think uh the LCD is cheaper than speech recognition 

Uh we go back on the decisions later 
Now we have a few new product requirements 

So I think that can be an d good option  LCD 

First  teletext 
We have internet now so we dont need the teletext anymore 
So not necessary 

Only for the television 
So we dont look at the other things like the radio or something 

We look at the age group of forty plus 
Uh no  younger than forty 

Our corporate colour and slogan must be used 

So you can see it on our site 

Now we have to decide what controls do we need 

Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said 

I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option 

Its a new requirement 

Yeah but we dont use it 

No discussion about it 

Well a power button 
Uh the well um I think separate channels  So

So so uh zero to nine or something 
Uh volume 

To move up  move down 

Do we make a menu 

Uh yes

I think it will be um q quite easy to use  to have uh uh four arrows 
Updown for channel selection 
and leftright uh for volume 

And if you press the menu button you get into the menu 

On the LCD screen  you mean 

Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the TV  Or you get the menu on the LCD screen on the remote control 

Think its better to have it on the remote control 

But then we come to the costs 

But well if you aim at the younger market  um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab  uh they will buy a nice looking um remote control 

So if we have a LCD sh uh screen  and uh not too many buttons  I think that will incre uh uh even when its a bit more cost  it will still sell 

Is this enough 

Mute 

I think thats enough for the next phase 

And uh we dont yet have to decide what the remote control would look like  Or

thats for the next phase 

Phase two is the conceptual design 

And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons 

Your individual action  you can find them in the email
