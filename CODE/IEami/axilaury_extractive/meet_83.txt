Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings

the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think well take those as read  um

the um th the the next uh thing we we well have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes
and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance
and then uh uh just tidy up with production

we basically have the same kinda layout here

you hold it like this
and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand  basically 
Um on the left weve got the scroll for the volume 
on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda
so you can hold it and scroll 
or you can hold it and and push 
Uh this is the power key 
um its kinda like the biggest

Uh thats the little menu key 
This is the infrared section

Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands
so you can you know talk to it like that

Um the logo is down down there um
and has the cover on it

the red bits the cover
and it kinda goes over everything
and then theres holes for the buttons to come through  Um 

And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic 
just kind of a light nondescript grey

and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers 
so they kinda just stretch over 

spongy like is something that people wanted
and it just sort of stretches over

But its also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers

and then the buttons come through

each one of em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the RR 

for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that theyd put them down vertically

we could broaden the broaden it out a bit

but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger

if we just lengthen it I guess
so it comes down to the base of the hand

The final product would actually stand up  yeah 

I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on

lets have a look at the um f finance 

if I get the uh spreadsheet up 

this is the companys uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design
and I I Ive treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us 

for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours  then that is not a special colour 

were just simply on batteries 
the the one th the one decision Ive had to make is that um
were we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with
and I I um Im Im Im certain that they they are around

that I dont think is a a serious problem 
The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive
but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design
so that that has to stay 

Um its simply made of plastic
so th thats uh thats no problem

we havent actually got a scroll wheel
we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um slider

I do dont know that theyre special colour 

the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five
uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what weve got is is so in innovative and uh and different
that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers

if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we cant operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give 

I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget  Um 

Andrew do you want what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation

Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve  from the point of view of the the consumer and the management 

what Ive been asked to do is  on the whiteboard
um gauge our team response to these questions 

on a scale of one to seven  one being true and seven being being false 

And then at the end just take an average

look at these questions 
Is the device f flashy and fashionable 

I think most definitely 

Id say definitely a one yeah 

and also uh technologically innovative 

Yeah  defi yeah  yeah

the voice technology indeed 

Easy to use 

I dont see we couldve made it any easier 

Uh suitable for the consumer 

Yeah definitely 

I think it made we met all of the consumer

Uh is it complicated 

No 

Uh functional 

Yeah definitely 

found easily 

Weve b built in the the speech  where are you  function 

Does it take long to learn to use 

No  not at all 

The RSI compares to the current standards 

Less buttons

it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well 

Um will device appeal to all age groups 

I think it will
because I mean uh old older people who cant manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so

we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money
but the funct the increased functionality  the e ease of use of the device might make up for that 

I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups

I think we can reasonably say its another another one 

in in in in my interpretation of managements instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement

its its simple to use 
um its its its within budget 

I I think weve done an amazing job

one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven 
Eleven divided by elevens one so equals average of one 

I think we worked well together
and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make

th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity 

seemed to discuss things pretty well

I think weve allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows 
Um I wont comment on leadership 
uh teamwork I think weve uh I think everybodys uh worked pretty well together 
Um weve just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens 

and new ideas found  um  again gi no given relatively everyday product  I think weve v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh
uh a new approach 
Um are the costs within budget 
Yes 
Is the project evaluated 
Were were all happy that it it meets all the criteria  um
Thank you very much indeed 

Cool  thank you 

So I call the meeting closed 

Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that its its expensive to uh um l to make cause of the the th the double curves
