Uh as you all know were here to create a brand new fantastic remote 
Uh Im Nick Debusk 
Im the Project Manager 
Uh well just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what youre doing  what your what your role is um 

I am Corinne Whiting
and I will be the Marketing Expert

In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification 

In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching

And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation

 Im Ryan 

Um Im the User Interface Designer 
Um likewise Ive three different roles for each stage of design 
Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control 
Um in the concept design  the user interface 

And the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design 

Im Manuel
and Im the Industrial Designer in in this project um 
In the functional design phase Im Ill be dealing mostly with the requirements 
um well discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on 

Um um in the conceptual design um Ill be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product 
And uh the detailed design in the detailed design Ill be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself 

our our agenda is the opening  uh acquaintance which weve kinda done  Uh tool training  project plan discussion and then closing 

we are putting together a new remote control 
Um we want it to be something original 
Um of course were a not only a electronics company but a
fashion um conscious electronics company 
so we want it to be trendy um
and we want it to be easy to use 
Um weve got the functional design  conceptual design and detailed design

lets just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have 
and then we can go into how were gonna design it

function of remote control is just just

change channels is its main function 

we want it to be um a TV remote or
I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote 

I suppose you c try make it a universal remote

But  you know  they all sorta have the same role changing channels  volumes and then programming 
I think they all work on the same prin principle as well

Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose em 
So if theres a g a way of finding it quite easily  I thought thatd be quite good quite a good feature 

So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh
like a tracking device

you could whistle
or make a noise

theres a button on the TV that you press

and itd beep 

Generally  all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance 

so theyre kinda like long and rectangular 
Do we want something crazy 

we want something new thats gonna stand out 

Maybe sorta spherical or something  A ball 

Maybe like userfriendly 

where you can use both hands  like a little keyboard type thing 

I thought maybe  because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another

and maybe the actual controls are inside or something 

you cant have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time 
so there are always the some restrictions

Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be 

How sturdy is it gonna be 

we want it to to hold up to somebodys child  you know  throwing it across the room

so ballshaped  uh you know  if it were ballshaped maybe 

It could be cased on the outside
and t everything could be inside 

we want it to be modern  fun  sturdy 

Its something that were supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros

goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros  what they wanna make on it  so 

Also since were partners of the International Remote Control Association 
maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal 

marketing  you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there 

And maybe as far as design goes  maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences 

Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like 

We want it to be a b a ball 

I could draw sorta the ball idea 

this is where its connected together 
and then when you open it out  it could fol it could be maybe flip  like a flip phone 

Maybe a hinge thatll have to be the strongest part of it 

I think  sometimes remotes have too many buttons 
so maybe as simple as possible 
um as few buttons inside as possible 

if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it 

um the ball is a nice idea
because of its stability really 

Also also you risk the hinges here  Thats thats um a problem 

so wed have to have it flat on one side at least  down here somewhere 

but thats of course a weak point  yeah 

I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball 

The shape is perhaps not the most ideal 

there must be a compromise between um stability and design here  so 

I cant think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote 

its not innovative 

everybody does long remote

My idea was just to have it be kind of like a
keyboard type shape  you know  like video games

We could also try to do the hinge thing 
so it could like flip out that way 

but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier 

I mean maybe design something  thats sort of like

So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better 

Because even I suppose even with the ball

it still not the ho easiest thing to hold  yeah 

I think its definitely got to be a a onehanded a onehanded job 

if its small it probably looks better 

may not be th as functional 

say we went with the ball the ball function
um  but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um
to make it easier to hold on to 

But if were gonna make it flat on the bottom  then that eliminates our ball anyways 

And then we have the problem with the hinge 

The question is also  I dunno  d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it 

so then we forget the ball 

So weve got our sort of keyboard kind 

Question is what makes those game pads functional 

I think thats pretty much the form for full hand 
So its a round shape underneath that makes it comfy 

Except for that I think well not probably not get a get away from some longer design 

and Batteries go weak as well 

Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side 
So that either way youre pointing it it would work 

O of course the more technology you stick in that  the more itll cost  so 

but um its rather about an instinctual thing 

Otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work 

just to finish up 
should we s go with this plan 

And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want 

it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting  I think 

And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around
