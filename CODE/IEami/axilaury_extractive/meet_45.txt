Im the Marketing Expert 

Tarik Rahman  TARIK 
Industrial Designer 

Uh  Dave Cochrane 

And youre going to be the User Interface 

This is the agenda for todays meeting  As you can see  w opening  acquaintance  tool training  project plan discussion  and closing 

the reason were here  were gonna design a new remote control 

The very broad overview is original  trendy  and userfriendly 

Were gonna have the three kay phases 

the functional  architectural  and the detailed design  Um
First ones gonna be covering the user requirement spec  technical functions  working design 
Second seems to be conceptual components  properties  materials 
and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far 

Ebenezer  you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal 

Here we have an elephant 

Tarik  would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry 

Uh  here we have a tiger  Uh

Dave  if youd like to uh have a dash 

Um Um  the monkey  um 

but uh cats are one of my favourite animals 

Project finance  As you can see  twelve point five Euros per unit 

and were hoping to sell them for twenty five 
If were aiming for fifty million Euros were gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them 

that was profiting 

Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market 

one thing Im aware of is  th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market theres theres a em emerging market for sort of touch screen LCD remotes
that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models 

Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design 
And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket 

with the price range were looking at  going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our

Absolutely prohibitive 

But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion 

I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units 

and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros 

Would the the idea something along the lines of  one on button would turn on say the video recorder  the TV  maybe the sound system as well  all in one go  is that kind of

you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the DVD player and it turns the TV on and onto the right channel as well  um

um Ive noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television 

we used to e play games using our cable  using the cable subscribed the cable providers 
but our remote controls would get worn out really easily 

Ive seen the barcode design before 

Instead of people entering in what time things start  you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins 

and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar  um keypad  for playing games 

I think for gaming  you know you want you want some big buttons for up  down  left and right  shoot 

Uh  you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television 

so well have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality 

thatll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility

do you think they should have some sort of stick on it  rather than buttons 
Like uh control pads  you know of games 

and that could allow n easy navigation  used as a joystick as well 

Mmhmm  The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic 

um  how the user interface might work 

something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand 
But of course  uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall  

small  stylish  and something thats just a little different 

Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form 

Ill write up what weve um kind of quickly done 
and Ill get that out to everybody
