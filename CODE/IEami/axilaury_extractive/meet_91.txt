Well weve made our prototype anyway 

You pass it round to have a look 

Y no  its a slightly curved around the sides 
Um  its almost curved like up to the main display as well 
And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down 
And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line 

We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top 

Cherry would be alright actually 

Yeah  and cherries are fun  summery 

For the first time  well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons 

Uh  we just chose simple shapes for all them 
Um  the important ones are the volume ones 
So we made them a bit bigger 

Hum  you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons 
so youve got the volume in orange on design there 
and the the channel is in blue 

And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button 

so uh but there would be a cost implication on that 

Well the colours wouldnt like thats they wouldnt be too important 
but we didnt have any white PlayDoh 

Yes  well have the slideaway 

and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance  And the and the cost implication 

So um  and then the production evaluation  as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture 

Right  so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half Euros 

We could do it as we d go along  the production costs  looking at the prototype 

Okay  so  by the fact that weve got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source  weve got a single curved case  Weve got a rubber uh case materials supplements 

Okay  W the button supplements 
Well  originally  I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple 

Well  so weve got one special button form  which was the apple 

Weve got special material  rubber  wood  titanium  et cetera and that 
so  I was originally  I was thinking rubber wasnt special 

So you would only have the one special button that was rubber 
whereas the rest would be hard plastic 

I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material  rather than per button 

So  that would that would work out fine if uh uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons  then that would be fine 

So thats nine point one there

I switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor 
At the moment weve just got the simple chip  which costs one 
Um  I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing  which puts up to four 
We should be slightly over our budget

Okay  that gives us twelve point seven

So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours  kept them all the same colour  then we could have the voice recognition

Maybe um wed be giving up on the kinetic 

i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries 

The the problem was the batterys running out and losing the um losing the remote 
So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them 

But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options 

I think the voice recognition 

The other option if were planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful  would be to um make it originally  were gonna make it a simple product 

Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as weve got it now first 
and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after 

So  weve all got a note of its thirteen point seven  isnt it  with everything we want on 

But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that its got no battery 

and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that weve formulated 

And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven 

So  I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well  at the end 
Um so  We have to say whether its true or false that the product looks and feels fancy 
Um The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation 
Whether its easy to use 
Whether its incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer 
And whether its a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product 
And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently 

So the first one is um  does the product look and feel fancy 

Okay  well we have a single curve 

Um  then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel  which was in at the time 

Yeah  Id maybe give it a a two 

What Is one false  or is t one true 

Ones true 

So uh say about a two for fancy 

And I mean  how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon 

Um  deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition 
and if we had either of those for our budget  they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition 

In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic 

weve got weve got the speech recognition on it  havent we 

The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five 
And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic 

so it seems to me that if youre going for the sample sensors speaker  youre basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else 
And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery  to have your uh sample sensor speaker 

If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough 

How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic 

If you have a in plastic rather than rubber  then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then  you could keep your sample sensor 

So it says if we make a slightly more fancy  then we lose points innovation 
and if we make it more innovative innovative  then we lose points on it being fancy  so

I would go for a one on that at this point in time 
Um  incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer 

its got the cherry and the sponginess 

Say about a three maybe 

The product is a recognisable real r uh reaction product 

I woulda said two would seem reasonable 

and its got a fairly big label on the bottom saying where it comes from 

So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing  as well as having the logo on and all that 

Two 

But um  I think the logo would definitely be recognisable 

So were now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements 

What does what do all them numbers mean then 
Do we add them up and rate or anything 

I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be
Im just gonna do this in my head 
One point eight isnt it or something 

So yeah  pretty close to a two 

So its I mean its pretty good at the moment 
but its gonna get worse  isnt it 

So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it 

Im not sure 

well probably have to rerate it 

If you want to keep kinetic  right  youve got a choice there of going down to battery  which would save you one 

Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has 

Well  you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements 

Youve got the sample sensor and and sample speaker  which is your big item 

which gets us um In right within the budget range 

and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements 

Yeah  I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case 

So were going for plastic  yes 

Oh actually we just have a plastic case  then we lose two points 

Yeah  I think we should just imagine white buttons 

Do we just have one special uh special forms down here 

You got special colour 
Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple 

weve got nought point eight left 

Well  weve got special form 
Now that would be one button 

Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special

and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button 

I guess wed have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour 

So  special colour  you want three in there 

Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour

One original colour and then sort of two supplements  I think maybe 

You were making these buttons down the bottom  I was presuming  bigger than the other ones 

And weve got special form is the one apple 

the volume ones should stand out a bit 

Maybe thatll be a second supplement 
Then theres a spe a second special form 

Yeah  thats twelve point three 

So I think that should still be okay 

So decide weve lost a little bit on the fashion
and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it 

Yeah  So youd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two 

so thats like if thats the new age kind of um inno innovative c type company  then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on

So its w if weve if weve put in for another special form on a button  then maybe they could be a different shape 

Maybe other ones could be something else shaped 

And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one 

Well you could argue you might do it once a year  you would change 
because at the moment youre making a red apple 
So next year you could make next years model the same  but have it as a a yeah whate whatever  a lemon 

Yeah  I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something  maybe 

weve the main thing weve changed really is the casing isnt it 

So maybe in a sense not having that  maybe weve lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side 

So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability  were pretty much the same  maybe 
So  I mean we could maybe put two again on them 

And what about the sort of innovation 

Um  well weve still got the kinetic energy  Um

And the speech feature 

But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics  but

But then what colour would you make the Rs 

Um  apart from maybe doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue  like the casing 

Well  but youve got the company logo on there 
which would effectively be a stickon badge 

Did you get told what the company colour is or

Im still not quite sure weve established that 

so long as our companys logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline 

So basically  even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display  because youve got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo  it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product 

weve got point two to play with if you really wanted to 

Well  in this one  youve actually got three colours of buttons 
Well  we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour 

Were assuming that all the buttons on the second panel  the hidden away panel  would all be standard 

Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know  on the second page  as it were  that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour 

I think if they were just all small round blue buttons  itd be fine 

And then for the more functional buttons  we dont worry too much about that and just have that as like a
plus its hidden away anyway 

I mean its the sort of thing that  I mean  you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume 

But if youre opening the panel and youre looking and youre tuning  then youre paying a bit more attention 
So it may be sort of different colour buttons isnt so important 

Shouldnt we maybe lose a point on fashion 
go to a three 

Well  but I think we said that w Because you got rid of the rubber  we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons 

well  we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something 

And did we make it a cherry officially 

Yeah 

As an overall product which has to be quite cheap  weve just about achieved everything 

So do we have anything else to discuss 

So weve done the the finance bit and the Excel project and the Weve done the redesign 
So were now on to project process 
Now satisfaction with  for example  room for creativity  leadership  teamwork  means  et cetera  whiteboard  digital pens  et cetera 

I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down 
which I will do 

Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough 

I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary 

Well  we were finding out various things in in be inbetween the meetings 
and they didnt the one meeting didnt always follow on for the other one  you know 
sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where  you know  youd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness  but in the first one youd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons 
and I dont understand why it would be in separate meetings that youd do that 

The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process  you would normally  you go to a meeting  you decide  right  you do this  you do that  you do that 
Then you go away 
You find out information 
You then come back 
You then discuss it 

Whereas  this time  youre really getting it from a database source 

what do you want to put down 

Creativity  seemed okay 
Um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed 

I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project 
I mean a remote control isnt the most um kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing 

But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control  in a way 

I mean this one seems  From the website it looks its quite innovative 

It was quite good with this um the white board  having that and the digital pens 

so how do you reckon teamwork went 

That went okay  yeah 

I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them 

To uh go uh reasonably well 

I dont think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything

Bit bit arbitrary 

Well  I mean I dont think it I just dont think it fitted in with the rest of their products 

So  were m were meant to comment on leadership and the means  E G whiteboard  digital pens  et cetera 

we did find a new idea 
I mean sort of a kinetic remote control 

voice recognition  especially not could

Youve got voice recognition computers 
thats not remote controls 

Yeah  so its just like the same products  but just put together in a different way 

But we cant really all fairly comment on leadership

So our experience of leadership wasnt really as much as yours 

I certainly didnt get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked 

Alright uh means  so whiteboard um so really  its uh equipment  Oh 

Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but

But I mean  I d I dont Im not sure I see the value in these 
I mean  they record what youre writing 
and then what do you do with it 
Where do you get the recording 

So its not just for us 
its for the experiment as a whole  so

New ideas found  so one or two 

Kinetic powered remote control  Um 

Voice um recognition thing 

uh are the costs within budget 

Uh  dont forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary 

I think that weve got two questionnaires
and a report on the last meeting 

Whether whether thats considered to be sort of part of the corporate identity  I dont know 

Lose a little bit on the fashion  yeah  but
