Id uh like to welcome you to our first meeting 

Um Im the Project Manager of this project 

This is uh the agenda for our first meeting 

I will hope we will get acquainted to each other 
Well do a little tool training with these two things 
Well take a look at the project plan 
Uh there will be time for discussion 

Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table 
Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field
so the little cameras can see your face 

and there are microphones here also 

and uh Id like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project 

and my uh function is User Interface Design  I think 

uh Im the Industrial Designer

Im uh Marketing Expert 
My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers 

I said uh were working on a project
and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control
which uh has to be original  trendy and of course  user friendly 

It consists of three phases  namely the functional design  conceptual design and detailed design 
As you can see  all of these phases consists of two parts  namely individual work part and a meeting

But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here 

They are smart boards 
As you can see  you can give a presentation on them 
And uh this one here is a white board 

Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder
and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room 

As you can see  this is the same tool bar uh as is located here 
Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page 
um uh to go back and forward between pages 

Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board  for instance

Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want 

its not such a fast board 

and of course you can also  when you click here  uh erase things 

And um you can also delete an entire page 
but we ask you not to do that 

because we want to save all the results 

And you can also um lets see I think its here uh change the uh colour of your pen 

Um thats what you will need for our first exercise 
because Im uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal 

to do it on a blank sheet 
with different colours

and also with different pen widths

Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word 

Or maybe you should guess what Im drawing  eh 

it could be a turtle  or a snail 

Its a giraffe 

it can reach everything 
And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project 

Could you write the words  uh underneath it 

Ive drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence 

You can try out the eraser now 

Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros 
And were hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros
and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market 
And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max 

its time uh for some discussion 

Whats your experience with remote control 

I always lose them 

A lot of buttons which you dont use

Not user friendly 

Black  all black 

maybe we should try to make it fun 

You had different remote controls for different devices 

perhaps you can integrate them or something 

but then again you you still have a lot of buttons 

theres a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection

but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in Dutch  Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly 

maybe a a minimalist design  the least uh possible amount uh of buttons 

But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it 
Because uh things for uh teletext  I dunno uh  w

you dont want to bother people with uh loads of buttons 
but on the other hand they need many buttons

Because I think a market will be all kind of people  Elderly p el elderly  young people  so 

I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain  yeah 

I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control  they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television 

but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control  Its impossible 
Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext  and on the other side uh just n uh regular television  Uh

Because you cant use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television 

always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code 

Um our next meeting uh will start well were a little bit early  but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes 
In the meantime uh theres time for some uh individual actions 

meeting will close in five minutes 

Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification 
The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design 

the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design 

Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach 

I think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working 

I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly 

see you all in about thirty minutes  then 

Where does it says we have to make a remote
