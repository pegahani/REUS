Ive uh made a presentation
uh but uh Ill open it on the Smartboard  so we can all see it 

Well this is called the the the kickoff meeting 
So uh Im the Project Manager 

And an uh a nice agenda 
Uh well do the opening
and then uh well meet each other 

Ill Ill show you the the tools we have here  so that we can all use them 

Well discuss about our first ideas about the project 
and then uh well close the meeting 
and then we can uh individually uh do our things
and then uh well get back here 

We have to uh design a new television remote control 

Um we want it to be original 
so a nice uh a nice new design 
Uh trendy  its also for young people 
and we have to just uh make it uh modern 
And uh friendly 
so size does matter 
And uh Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place  that kin those kind of things 

There happen to be uh three stages 

functional  conceptual  and d detailed design 
Um so every time we well do some individual work  get meeting  talk about it  uh and then go into the next phase 

We have uh these two Smartboards 
Um well as I just showed  theres a project management folder  a project document folder on the desktop 
It just works exactly the same as a computer 
You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop 

Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things 

This is a uh well a drawing board 
you have a these different uh functions on the board 

So you have a a nice pen 
and its works just like a bal ball pen 

Of course w doesnt work any more 

We can uh uh well you can save a file 
So if uh we draw we have to save everything 

Uh just we can start a new one  and we just go on  and dont throw anything away 

Um you can here select a pen 

Its a bit uh childish you have to write 
Its not as fast as you w you know it 
but it does work sometimes 

So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board 

We going to try it 

Alright  your favourite animal 

Im just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh beast

I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment 

Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose  loosen up  a bit uh meeting each other

Were kinda losing time  though 

Its a hedgehog 

and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal 

Its a rabbit 

save it and start a new uh

These are very important documents  of course  uh these drawings  uh

Yeah well we have to save everything

Theres also different colours
and different uh well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness 

Its just a bird 

you choose a new colour 
And a new pen width uh also format 

Its a cat 

Well then uh the serious uh stuff 
Were we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally
um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars  but uh twenty five Euros 
Our profit aim is  worldwide  fifty million Euros 
So I didnt uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell 
we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros
so  keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff  and uh marketing uh research 
Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls 
first about design uh about uh aim in the market etcetera 

Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls 

Well I I didnt have to prepare anything about uh
its not  its its not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls 

Well uh just w were uh four uh if we if we would just have one then

I think its im its important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors 
Get the good points
uh try to merge them into one universal remote control 
On our corporate site I saw uh a new DVD player uh were gonna produce 
Maybe its important to make it compatible with the DVD player

Furthermore its important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world  for different cultures  maybe 
because we want to we want to well fifty million 

No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh
and numbers and uh that every culture in uh  yeah  people in every country can recognise 

I also think we should not add too many buttons 
Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think 

Y y you dont use uh the half of them thats thats

and make the other buttons uh multifunctional or something 

Maybe we could make one button to switch between DVD player and TV

so it doesnt uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh

we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use  we uh we make 

and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a DVD player 

And stereo uh s uh audio installations 

And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes 

because we look at competitors
and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design

It has to be different and familiar at the same time 

we could use another form or shape or colour  that kind of things 

I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing
you can make it uh triangle shaped 
but thats not uh very recognisable 

Well we we could make more more oval or something  and and

N we can use uh it as a as a game pad 
So one hand has the beer  so the other hand uh

but young people want something different

Yeah but its quite important that it fits 

one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so
Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh

so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh  yeah  useful

for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home
but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I dont like to use them 

When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here 

It shouldnt be boxy 

I dont agree with the long box uh shape

But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this 
and you can make it another shape 

No if y if you look at new Phillips uh DVD with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes arent box shaped 

No thats ol old fashioned 

Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end 
and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end 

uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand 

A it h it has it it has a thats tha th th shape that it fits your hand 

It shouldnt be too boxy  you know 

but no no I dont mean an entire box like completely square
but a also with round edges of course 
but in in in at the end its still this long box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh to fit 

A big recognisable button on top or something 
The buttons should uh also be not too small  not too big  of course 
and uh n uh uh not too close uh together 

But it should be possible to to um make it ap apparent that there are two functions for every button 

Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions 

and maybe we should use colours 

Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them 
and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs

Thats kinda trendy 

Sound nice  Yes 

I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um

so I think individually well have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera 

Well its just uh about our first ideas now

I think its uh its important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make 

Youll get specific instructions when youre back in your room so uh its uh logical uh  I think 

So well just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over 

Yeah now we can still talk about the material 

I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course  hard plastic 
the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh 

Yeah it shouldnt be too heavy 

Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons

It its a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things 

infrared beams an infrared beam I think 

Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television

The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly 

Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea 

Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes 

and you can always use a front front on it  you know 
You can use it just plain
but you can To make it more trendy 

And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh

Well you can make profit with them 
and its a way to make them trendy 

Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something

Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and DVD set we are going to sell 
so if they are uh black and black black and silver well make them black and silver so

But people of often dont like bright colours or something 
We have to make it grey or s or black 

But thats uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh 

Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I dont know what your specific instructions will be  but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the uh remote 
And you will look into the technical design and um form  I think 

Finish meeting now 

Well uh were going to back uh back into our rooms so

Next meeting is in

In thirty minutes
