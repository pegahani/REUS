Uh before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting were in 

uh These are cameras 

This thing uh that looks like a pie 
are actually all microphones 

you must be careful with uh with uh all this 
And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be 
And that has to do with the camera settings 

Welcome at the kickoff meeting 
My name is uh Danny Wolfs 

uh and uh I think its very uh good to introduce uh yourself 

Uh this is the agenda for today 

Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards 

Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance  acquaintance to uh to to ourselves 

Then the project plan 

Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end 

Im the Project Manager 

Im Juergen Toffs 
Im the User Interface Designer 

Im the Industrial Designer 

Im uh Tim 
Um my function is the Marketing Expert 

my names uh 

First a little about the project aim 
Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control 
Uh maybe you have read uh read the website 

Uh there must be a new remote control 
Uh first of all uh it must be original  uh and trendy 

But at the same time uh userfriendly 

Uh there are three stages 
There is a functional design 

Then the conceptual design 

Uh because at the detailed design  how  part two  uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of If its uh its possible technicalwise 
Uh each stage is uh uh is broken up in two uh two stages  individual work and a meeting 

the tool training 
We have two smart boards 
This one is for the presentations  the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had 
Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing 

This is called a smart board

Um and as you uh may have heard  the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen  Not in y the the My Documents 
So if you wanna show something  put it in the shared folder 
Uh This uh is very straightforward  with the save  the print  the undo  the blank  the select  the pen 

I dont uh gonna explain it all 
because I think you know uh how it works 

We we may not delete anything 
So uh if you have uh drawn something  save it 

At uh the white board on the left  Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal 

Uh important is that we use different colours  and uh different pen widths  Widths  Widths 

Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal 

I dont know really how it works 

Drawing goes with uh this thing 
Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here 

And uh wait uh wait a few seconds 

you can guess what it is 

its a cat 

You have to draw uh push hard on the pen

it is a turtle 

Uh Tim  what kinda line width did you have 

Uh the big lines were like nine 

Its a dog 

So I think you can see its real uh really a easy programme to use  Not difficult at all 

Is it a rabbit 

now were gonna dig into the to the serious stuff 
Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro 
and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro 

from my point of view  I dont think its uh gonna be very uh very high tech  high definition  uh ultra modern uh kinda remote  for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro 
Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million Euro 

Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five  uh uh you got two million  two million remotes 
But our marketing range is uh  market range is international 

now its time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things 
You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself  at home 
What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature 

what whats the most uh important thing at a remote control 

I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels 
And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible  Uh

So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a DVD and radio

I have some uh points from marketing point of view 
Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive  uh small  fairly cheap 

Um I personally think it has to be multipurpose 

And uh by making it multipurpose  it uh has a new feature  adds a new feature to the market 

Um maybe some other technology than infrared 

Um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth 

And something like an LCD screen 

For what purpose 

Its nice as an added feature feature 
that um  when youre on a certain channel  you can see on the LCD screen uh what programmes are coming up or

it must be really uh innovative  technicalwise 

our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things 

So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to

To the current market 

Uh at the beginning of such a project  its its its very uh cool to talk about  well  this would be cool  that would be cool 
Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh

you uh will have uh individual actions

Um the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design 
Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions 

we must first agree on uh what were going to m going to make 

Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems 

We should have some agreement on that before we

I I dont think we have to be  we have to agree on that  Uh

I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually 

We can plan further  I think 

we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh

Consensus on the  what were gonna do 

Uh a little plan on on what were going to do 
So you dont uh uh come up with the user requirements who dont fit the the the the technical functions at all 

if the technical functions have to be designed  I Ive gotta know for what kind of machines they will be 

we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it  or how it has to be like 
And then in the next meeting we decide

we can take it from there 

each individually i individually uh must think on whats uh at uh his point of view is the most important 

You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach 
And I see you in uh thirty minutes
