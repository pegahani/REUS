welcome to our detailed design meeting 

and then um Ill talk about the minutes from the last meeting  what we d discussed um 
then well have the prototype presentation
and a look at the evaluation criteria 

and finally a do a production evaluation

were gonna use a kinetic battery um 
we want to use a simple chip 

were choosing a latex case w in fruity colours thats curved
and um were using push buttons uh with a supplement of an onscreen menu 

we made three different prototypes

our colours not are not fixed 

Uh we have the on off button at the tip  very visible  very big 
We have our up and down buttons 
which are also gonna be our channel selectors 
and we have our little menu button here 
If you push if youre just pushing these normally  theyre the menu buttons  if uh the volume buttons rather 
If you press select once  they become channel changing buttons 

Thats our number one prototype 

The little lightning bolt in it  very cute 

We call that one the rhombus 

Um this one is known as the potato 

Its an ergonomic shape 

Um Ive gone here just for just for four buttons on this one  Um
the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume 
So youve got volume up and volume down on the other side here 

Uh this middle button here brings up the onscreen menu

Could the middle button of the onscreen menu function as a power button 

it would make it hard to turn the machine off  to turn your TV off 

And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear  either way 
Um its a bit different  just a little bit more of a creative feel 
Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top 

And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more threedimensional 

plus its an interesting talking point to have standing up 
We figured it could stand up like this on your table  if you wanted it to  if I made the bot the bottom flat 

in terms of making decisions  what wed need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want 
then decide what kind of button layout we want  how many buttons 
and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons

normally wed go for fruity colours 
but maybe were also thinking that your sort of middle aged man  for an example customer  might not want a fruity coloured remote 

but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost 

we were we were talking about that a little bit

and we think that each of these are so distinctive  that it its not just like another piece of technology around your house 
Its gonna be somewhere that it can be seen 
So were were not thinking that its gonna be as critical to have the loss

Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device
that like I dunno  you tape to your to your TV

a little light beep goes off 

um that when you press it

I think it would be difficult technologically 

and then I wonder if its if its more just a gimmick then anything else 

There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something 
but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon 

Um we so we do weve decided not to worry about that for now 

cause well  the designs are very bright 
so youre right  theyre gonna stick out 

I sort of like this one 

it just its like small but still sort of like cute looking 

But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable  sort of cool looking thing

Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off 

Um uh why dont we do a product evaluation using your criteria 

I think were supposed to have one that we do it for 

I was a little vague on what exactly Im supposed to do 

I have to like write something on the whiteboard  so 

Its kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing 

It makes look more fruity as well 

There it could have a stem like that 

is that where people are leaning then  the potato 

Variety of colours are nice 
I think Im leaning towards the potato 

thats really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down  that one 

I am worried about like um using a menu 

withing menus there are submenus 
and so how do you get back to the main menu 

on the iPod  for example  you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again

But that has a menu button separate from a select button 

the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices 

Could these be used for going to submenus

maybe it can be one of those 

if you press down and hold

for two seconds  then it brings you back one level or something 

Potato 

some of the things that weve talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to 

what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately
rank each of the following things
and then Ill tabulate an average

and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven
with one being really extremely true
and seven being not true at all  or false 

First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective 

in my opinion the for now at least  the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle
so Im gonna say its like a three 

I I kind of think its its unique enough that Id give it a one or a two 

I dunno if fancy is the word I would use 

and same sort of scale for functionality  is it functional 
I think its extremely functional 

I think itll get everything done 

then Im gonna give it a two 

Um is it technologically innovative 
Mm  Not really  I mean not so much 
cause we we dont have the LCD screen 

the kinetic battery 

How many people would notice that  though 

And if its made of like latex  that whole idea  thats pretty cool 

Think Im gonna go with the four as well 

Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality
and if indeed its made of latex or rubber I its spongy all the way 

Give it a one 

and the next is  does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables 

is it gonna be yellow 

We might wanna keep it yellow 

I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing 
but if we had all the buttons in black  and a design in and the outside in yellow  thatd be our corporate one
and we could also have alternative colours  one a more conservative one  one thats more fruity 
Um and can we have like an RR inscribed on the bottom or something 

it was inspired by the potato 
so I think its pretty fruity 

I think i its kind of mangoey too 

Thats a much more trendy than a potato

um  and does the design match the appropriate behaviour 
Remember earlier we discussed that people dont use a lot of buttons 

so Im gonna give it a one 

also we talked earlier about RSI and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing 
Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account 
I think Ill give it a two 

And if its repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that youre constantly pushing 

And the ease of learning it 

The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing 
but I think if its one its one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out  but youll have it afterwards 
So Id I think Id give it a two I guess 

because you have to you have to use the menu system
and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are
and that could take a bit of learning at first 

So Id Id give it a four 

also earlier we had something about losing it
and so now were not addressing that at all 

I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour 

Im gonna Im gonna give it a four 

how w how well does it address just being simple 

Um it like wants to be simple but its not like totally totally simple 

Im give it a three I guess 

and fashionable 

Its totally fashionable 

I think its bringing technology and fashion together real really well 

And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal  that whole thing 

if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements 

So Ill give it a a two 

we didnt we didnt address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo 
so lets lets make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an RR on it 

I think all of them should have an RR 

now were gonna look at finances 
Um I have an Excel sheet that were actually gonna calculate the cost um 

Were using kinetic battery 

Simple 

Guess its doublecurved 

dont we need plastic  and

It was rubber and special colour 

were using were gonna need at least two special colours 

I dont know what the se the basic colour is though 

like well have yellow and black 

Maybe the RR will be in colour as well 

And how many buttons do we have 

We have six 

the case material will just have one colour 

but then the buttons will be in special colours 

Special form 

I think theyre fine 
Material  we want them rubber as well probably  yeah 

Thirteen point seven 

what can we reduce 

lets have our buttons all be one colour 

Maybe its singlecurved 

Its single curved 

case material is rubber
and its a special colour 

It was it was thirteen
and now its fifteen 

Now its twelve 

What was our target price again 

Twelve point five 

So were okay  I think 

Um are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro 

Yes 

Lets move on to the project evaluation 
Project process  Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity  leadership  teamwork  the means  any new ideas found 

So I guess what were gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project 
the information we got on the news  how we used it 
if we were able to um  you know  use our creativity with the information 
um how how well I guess I led it 
um the how well we worked together as a team 
um the digital pens 

the whiteboard 

I felt very creative 

I think weve been successful

I enjoyed making the prototypes 

I think we couldve done even better with a little bit more information 
like whats a singlecurved case 

but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well 

if Id had more market research on the fruits and vegetables  maybe we couldve taken that into account 

I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally 

That was the last one  like I chose not to do a PowerPoint

I think we all made um very significant contributions 
I dont think anybody dominated it 

Mm  What did we find for new ideas 
People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables 
I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them 

Is the project evaluated 

Yes 

theres the final questionnaire and meeting summary 

this is the great product kids 

and that we have a market for it  um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three

Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results

I do like the Martian remote 
If we could choose more than one  that would be my second choice 
Although the tog toggle

I would break it  I would break it 

Is it started as a pear 

Kind of looks like a penguin  like with no eye 

Nothing will come up until after our meetings supposed to be over 

otherwise the technology today was kinda cool 

I got more master classes 

what did I get through the corporate website 
Its just inspiration about circuit boards 

the Excel thing is pretty cool 

I learned a lot actually 
I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to 

I wrote it all down 
because I thought it would be relevant  like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control 
but then theyre like  you dont actually need this

I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing 

We didnt we didnt use the whiteboard that much 

Although I dont see how we could have very l at least for me

and I think usually  like whiteboards are good  you know like crossing out ideas  or like if we had had like a brainstorming period 

we couldve put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it 

And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at  like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint

cause we all needed them separately  kind of on the whiteboards in this room 

when you were um creating your um prototypes here  did you work together or did you like do separate projects 

Uh we we worked together 

we sort of made different shapes

well done with the management  I felt well managed 

I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time 

Its kinda fun 

we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings 

I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided 
But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings 

I think the last time we had a lot of information  but at the same time not quite enough 

like we we couldnt answer every single question 

And I I felt the first two meetings  that I was coming in with no information 

Um  Im a little I am a little disappointed that we didnt do a um something for losing the remote 

Just gonna make Im making full minutes 
so that itll include all of the agenda and all that 

How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you 

Most of it 

I didnt even think about adding slides 
cause I would just get slides with titles on them

I think the R and R  especially if the yellow and black one 

I think we just need the um the RR 

cause they didnt give me any clear  like yellow  grey  or 

I guess it is black  grey 

I just feel like if youre really doing like a a really big market evaluation  you wouldnt just have like one set of source
