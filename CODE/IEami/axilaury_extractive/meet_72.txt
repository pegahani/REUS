Okay  here is our agenda for this meeting 

Um tool training  were going to  I guess  figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles 
Um were gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting 

Were gonna make a new remote control thats um original  trendy and also userfriendly 

Were gonna have discuss the functional design first  how is it gonna be used  whats the actual goal here  it has to operate TV  blah blah blah 
And were going to do individual work on that and then meet 
Same thing with conceptual design 

And then the detailed design  just more indepth  get the actual schematics of the remote 

First were gonna start off by using our tools 

I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we cant actually see what were writing 

Um right now so were all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal 

Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twentyfive Euro 
and our profit aim is fifty million Euro 
Were going to make this an international product marketed in the States  in Europe  in Asia 
And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote 

Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss 
Expe our experiences with remote controls um  our first ideas about this new remote 
anything that you can bring to the table for this project 

Well  we wanna make a multifunctional remote 

It needs to be compatible cause universal remote controls are never universal 

and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product  how it feels in your hand 

They want the ergonomic ones 

If its just flat and kind of boring th those dont Nobody wants to buy those any more 

What kinda battery would we want to use 

Double A 

So double or triple
