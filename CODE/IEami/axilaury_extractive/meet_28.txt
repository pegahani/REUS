Okay  So first  lets uh see the prototype 

And so  we have buttons and using LCD  or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the LCD  and then do on and off 

So  you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume 

And we have speech recognition 
Here you have microphone  and then it date records your voice  and then it try to recognise 

Oh  these are strawberries 

Material  we want to stick to titanium 

So  we want to have simple and perfect shapes  like I shown in these phones 

And you can choose colours on your day for each day  or even many colours 
For the LCD 

wh what are the strawberries for 

Thats location sensors 

lets see if uh th its meet the evaluation criterium 

so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven 
One meaning that  ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion  whatever it is 

what do you think  is it fancy 

So here  two  Up 
Then we have uh technology 

d I think its a one for that  at least 

Robustness  uhhuh 

Its um robust  yeah 

Well  so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control 

The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial 

And if you want to make to s twentyfive  you push on this 

Its much longer than that that being two two five  no 

we only address two main functions here
and the other functions will be on LCD  So

Its a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the LCD screen 

Okay  two 
So size and weight 

Up to three for that 

Colour and shape 

The case is silver titanium  no 

And what about the strawberries on the top 

Were just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction  too 
So  maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges  stuff for strawberries and different colours 

Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits  and

I suggested three 

And uh the last one is adaptive 

Okay  Lets go for one 

Now we have to do the average 

Two point one seven 

So now  it has to fulfil the financial criterium 

We need only one battery 

We have sample chip 

And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition 

Yeah  I think we will go for a single curve 

Titanium 

How many pushbutton 

Two 

The scrollwheel  okay 

One LCD displayed 

So we are at seventeen dot eight 

So think of what we can cut uh here 

I mean  producing electricity from mechanical energy 

to make electricity 

So  but if we select the hand dynamo its okay 

We we win one 

So  put minus one there  please 

Im not sure if this is legal 

Okay  were uh on target 

Project evaluation  good 

Mm  See mm how Are we a good team  Mm 

Is there enough room for creativity 

Yeah  yeah 

Teamwork  very strong  I would say 

I think whiteboard is useful 
Digital pens  useful 

Ah  we got new idea  speech recognition  location finding  New materials  new s uh this fancy strawberry design 

And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser 

Im not convince 

Well y you know  its this uh fruit and vegetable year 

Apparently  we have to choose one or the other 

if I look at what is the most expensive things  uh its the LCD
and the speaker 

Are we supposed to cut things out now
