In this meeting we will discuss our final design 
And we will do some evaluation about the  not only the product  but also the project 
And then were going to close the project today as well 

And this uh design  detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the lookandfeel of the design  the usability interface design 
and we will do the product evaluation 

Well have the prototype presentation first 
Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria 
Then we will look at the finance 
Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget 

Then we will do the project uh evaluation 

But first um we will do the this is prototype presentation 

this is what me and Richard came up with 
The default spot for the onoff button 
The mute button just below that 
Then theres the volume and channel selectors 
Simple plusminus button 
Uh we thought of a help button 
If you hold it and you press another button  uh the help goes to the LCD screen 
Then theres the zero to one to zero buttons  A button for teletext  A button for the subtitles  And the company logo 
So its rather simple prototype 

Um  is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality 
Um  when youre in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page 

Uh  thats just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh

you um came in uh page uh one hundred  Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons 

But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel  S so uh the shifting uh button  Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext  and shifting uh down  So

I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple  Uh just a few buttons and large buttons 
But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons 
So Im wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons 

I think if you look at most controls  theyve got more buttons than this 

the onoff button  its its a necessity 

The volume and channel buttons  you need you obviously need those those 
The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volumedown button twice 

I think the help button really is necessary
because theres no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does 

Uh  or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh

you cant leave out the number buttons I guess 

Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary 

So its rather basic already 

Just n normal plain buttons 

But theyre supposed to be equal sized  round  with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume  the the triangle and stuff 

and for the materials weve just chosen for rubber buttons  With a a different colour than the case 

I will move on to the finance part 

And I can tell you that were going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros 

I dont know if Ive filled in correctly 
so just correct me if you see uh something wrong 
I counted two batteries 
But maybe we can also use one 

Since it rechargeable 

Thats two Euros off 
We need the advanced chip 

Here we have the single curves 
Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro  Um 

but I think the single curved is good for design  and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control 

Then we have the case material supplements 
Its plastic 
Its the cheapest one we need 

But then the biggest costs are the buttons 
So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low 

Lets fir first count the buttons we have now 

Uh seventeen  Uh with the help button 

I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button uh by pressing down volume long  or pressing down a a number long 

Uh  d I assume youd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each 

So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one  by pressing

I was thinking  maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button 

On the chip youve got still uh four uh four buttons 

Also the LC display  I think its  I think its too expensive for the display we use 

If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip 

but whats the big advantage of our remote then 

Only the docking station  I guess 

Which isnt the the docking station isnt even in this c s schematic 

its not even taken into the price 

But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people 

Dont you think we can  if we can count this as v as one button  and integrate th uh these buttons in three 

maybe its feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little 

but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros 

It is  If you leave out the LC display  And if you use less buttons  Say Or you can take the single chip 

But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty 

Or we can leave out the ten buttons
and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers 

If you scroll you will see the numbers on the LCD display 
Until youve got the right number  then you push it 

That would bring up the price of the scrollwheel also  Integrated scrollwheel pushbutton 

but then you you can push uh some other button as well 
A Okay
Yeah  Thats right  So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second  then it g turns to that channel 

And the regular chip is not possible 

If you want to use an LCD screen you you need an advanced chip  yes 

And we can save a Euro by a flat design 

or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button 

but I think thats That is a big advantage 

cant we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button 

But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people 
who dont even know what a scrollwheel is 

I think so  Yeah 

With only five buttons on it  And a scrollwheel 

Holding a remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero 

And just um If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scrollwheel 

So we make one for the volume  one for the channel  Plus scroll 

we can leave the teletext in if we want 

So we can decrease this one to four buttons 

what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design 

I still think we should go for the single curve design 
But then again  all these changes are not really okay with me 
But since we just have to 
Id rather just go to the board
and get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote 

I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide  you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel 

But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one  Just to express our LCD screen a bit more 

I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier  Before we went on to the to the whole design 

Yes  Definitely 

This will really require a lot of marketing to get this to sell 
Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff 
This is not familiar for them 

But they know the scrollbuttons from uh old radios 
Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels 

What it costs under twelve and a half Euros 

Uh  yes they are 

But we can go on with the project evaluation 

I did some literature study study  and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier 
Translated it into criteria 

Um  is the remote fancy  The shape  look and feel 
Innovative  What new functions are there 
Uh  easy to use 
Uh  learnability is a very important factor here 
Uh  is it functional 

And the cost 
The target group  Is the remote really for the group were making it for 

I have to say this was a little hard 
because the minutes of our last meeting were not here 

thats because my pen failed to upload his data 

Is the design fancy  on a scale of one to seven 
We all go for six 

Um  is the design innovative 
I think so 

Seven 

Is the design easy to use 

Mm  Not really 

I would say four  Four or five between  Between four or five 

Is it functional 
Yes 

Do we have too many functions 

No 

Think its uh seven 

and do we um take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control  Like it getting lost and RSI influences 

Mm  we havent thought of that one 

Think we do 
Are the production costs within the preset limits 

they are now 
Does the design fit the group of focus 

I think thats a three 

I think with our new radio button  I think its uh I think its better 

I still I think its too m too fancy  Too too flashy 

I would give it a four 

I think Id go for two 

Is the company company recognisable 

Yes it is 

we have the logo there 

And they wanna put fashion in their products  Uh in the slogan of the company 
And we have the removable front cases 

I was also supposed to calculate the score 

These are seven factors times seven is forty something  Two 

Forty one out of forty nine 

Thats Around eighty percent 

I think thats a pretty nice score 

that brings us to the project evaluation 

Did we move through the right phases  you think  Along the process 

Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier  In the design phase 

So lack of information about prices 

Was there room for creativity 

Not too much  No 

Its because of the finance sheet  Yeah 

Yeah  there w there was enough room  but the finance uh

And I wouldve liked to go for the younger users also 
And just to be able to access internet and get something of your own 

Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions  Yeah 
Teamwork  Did it work out  Working together  Also  you two of you with the uh last phase 

The tasks are very structured 

Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do 

the smartboard  the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass 
but The digital the digital pen is very nice 

Failed download  Smartboard was irritating 

the sharing of the information was uh was okay 

Pen is here 

Uh  network 

Have we found new ideas for having this kind of meetings 

Um  yeah

any more ideas 
Or questions about the project  Or about the product 
Because I think then that we get to our last sheet 

Considering we are not going to make a docking station 

Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million 

I think we will  If we gonna export this product 

if were n gonna make a scrollbutton anyway itd be more for the younger people than for the older people 
So maybe we should just refocus 

Just put it on the market for everybody 
You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers 

So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market  Just as a test  See how it works 

I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is  than would be with older people  Even if it were their covers 

I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire  I think 

Five more minutes 

Then we still have some questions 
If somebody has some questions they can ask them now 

I think Im going to make our final presentation now 
And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation  Summary of the project 

Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again 

Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire 

And we can keep our LCD screen 
which can provide extra information  How to use the scroll wheel  How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles
