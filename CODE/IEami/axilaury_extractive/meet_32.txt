So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design
and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control 

So lets see the what did you prepare 

S so so I discussed with Guillaume 

and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes 
because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an LCD or not because its too expensive 

One with and one without LCDs 
Um but both comes with a charger
and then detachable and uh or control module 
And detachable big buttons for all people um 

Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh LCD um display 

S okay so Ill show you the the two prototypes 

And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joysticklike uh button 
You can uh choose the direction

You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here 
And here the the switch that control if you want

The the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere 

Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array 

Well so its a microphone array 

Oh its very costly  microphone array 

its just a single microphone 

I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your LCD you will be close to
well its better to to to place it here th than here  for instance 
And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off 
And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger 

How much does it cost this one 

Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars

Ah its above its above the budget 

but uh its just a prototype

the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars 

How many b battery is there 

Is it n the two AAs batteries in it 
AA rechargeable batteries 

Is that two or one 

Actually uh its a flexible thing 

So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger
and uh leave it uh alone  its alright 

I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there 

This button is like the mouse is like a joystick 
you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction

and it the additi functions associated to all the actions
you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button 
You can move up  down  left  right 
or you can do a swing 

Here I present another version without the LCD 

So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration 
The second version is also simpler 
we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also 

Uhhuh and also the switch 

Basically its the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before 
But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation 
Press one button uh acting as a a enter button 
So um yeah according to what you said its more robust to the user 
And uh its also cheaper to produce 
We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars 

And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger 

and if you disable speech recognition system then 

W w Ill Ill come to that point later on 

in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah 

Its that same charger that you can use for the handphone
but uh again depends on the types 
I think we have to investigate more on that  but

The price should be below twelve and a half Euro 

but as the Marketing Manager says  people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design 

but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment 

The price of selling is twenty five Euros 

the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular

If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system 

Something like customised  Yeah

for example the LCD  you can take it you can put it put it back in  or you can use the other one 
or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah 
You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you dont wan you pay less for the system you see 

Its pretty flexible in the yeah price 

You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control
that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control
i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do  and uh which channel you want to choose and so on 
H here is just the the the module for the kids
and th if the parents want to watch TV  up they come up with their modules 

We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons  clearly labelled 
and it acts like the previous one 
you just plug in and it works 

the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful 
Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons 
powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n

thats our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here 
Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you 
The first one is the speech recogniser 
again its detachable or addon 
And then we also have security feature

its very robust 

and the material  whats the material again 

The titanium

Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one 
again because this is AA batteries you can choose the types of battery you want 
Lithiumion may be a good one 

again you pay for what you get 
and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder 
So when you finish watching your TV and you the you t you turn off the TV  uh and then theres this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger 

And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary 
so we didnt define the vocabulary
so its up to the user to define

And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of TV programmes by genre 
and this can be used by the adult or by the children 

Whats the price to p to produce 

Well so the price to produce For uh the simplest one  say we start from four dollars to produce such a device 

The without without the charger
its about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems 
Two dollars for the uh for the addon modules 
and finally three dollars for the charger 
So if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the LCD  which costs two dollar  you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two 

We dont have all the options 

so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars 

so you want more function you pay more 

its below the the the budget 

I think we will just have a rough look
and then we can make our statements 
and we can finalise the product based on this discu

So the marketing made an evaluation criteria
and these were some of the findings 
and uh in the market the people are not really interested with LCD  without LCD  with speech recognition interface  or without speech recognition interface 
but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is  they want to have an fancy look and feel 
it should be very fancy with colourful
and uh very handy to hold 
And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative 
Of course in that we could put LCD or recognition to be more technologically innovative 
And the third one is easy to use 

since we havent yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the TV screen uh uh with just four buttons 

Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself

here you can find these are the latest fashion updates 
and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year its going to be an year of fruit and vegetable 
so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable  or whatever they like 
So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes 
And the second thing is  and if the material  they really do not want it to be very hard  as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium 
it should be somewhat spongy 

you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy 

Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias 
One is fancy look 
second is innovative 
and third is easy to use 

So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these 
say that we have a seven point scale  from one to seven 
and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this 

so on this scale  if it is true  if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one 

So now you have with LCD and without LCD 

or if it is false  it doesnt it looks uh it doesnt look much fancy  then you could just tell me seven 

But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party 

according to you designers 

On on this scale the LCD remote control  How do you look how does it look 
D is it very fancy or doesnt look much fancy 

Ill Ill say three or four 

I think we can improve on the design 

Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design 
Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect  functional aspect  but also the simplicity 

So I take three on with LCD 
So without LCD how would you rate it 

Uh four 
I think its its uh more easy to make f fancy things when its not complicated
so removing the LCD um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look 

And in the sense of innovativeness  with LCD 

Well its its the same for both
so I will give a five  six 

from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of TV programmes by content 

and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity
and simplicity  few buttons  weve uh A lot of functionalities 

So without LCD 

Mm for both its the the same innovations 

So maybe I can put six to seven 

actually uh to make it with LCD you make more efforts 

then when it is without LCD there is not much innovativeness 

Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the LCD 

but you have the same programme on the TV screen 

We havent really uh determined what are actually actually

I mean on the LCD  according to what I understand from your model is  you have a joystick here  and you have LCD  you just press your joystick  you get here a programme 

on the TV you dont it doesnt display on the TV now 

If you have the LCD 

Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the TV 

But you cannot display all on a LCD 
Anyway for for the users who who who opt for LCD well give them the give them the LCD 

So without LCD you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness 

Well I think both are really easy to use

and uh well t p the menu are clear  wellorganised  so

so I will give a six for the easy to use 

No its just if I I see the the f the rate I think its better to do it without LCD 
Because thats with LCD just will increase the price 

So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes
according to fruit and vegetable
or a spongy touch
without LCD and without speech recognition 

I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect 
I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people 
For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated
because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons 
For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity 

but but uh what Im trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people 

So without LCD I just take it five 

Um six 

and its going to be much simpler to use 

so lets go back to our laboratory and

To improve on the design 

what about the integration of speech recognition 

The speech recogniser is a addon module 

Thats going to be an optional 

S s oh I think its better to have this without LCD 
As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without LCD it is going to reduce the cost also 

I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control 
because maybe parents will lose these uh

but I mean if you have an addons  the kids may just uh hide the parental module

Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or 

The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component  and doesnt want the parental control because its a couple who do not have children
when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people 
and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them 

So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional 

But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost 

I think it inc increase 

because its three different pieces uh to to to build but

its I think its cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module  but uh

Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the youre gonna keep the same customer 
because the same customer will come back to buy other addons 

i i so if dont dont buy now they can buy i in the future 

attracting them to come back in again and again 

Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded  it would be a good thing right 

And uh whats the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls 
Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types 

but we are also the um well the components will have to change
because uh we have to deal with the shape

Or uh it could be like this the PCB would be the same for all  but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all 

What we can change is to propose the customers with skins 
For example the i the mobile phones nowaday  they sell different kinds of skin
and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better 

we can have the same global shape
and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that 

I think you need to look into the material 

I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models 

Project evaluation project satisfaction  for example 
I dont know  we have to ask these question 

Room for creativity 
This room is a bit small  but
but I think its okay for us to work with 

This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations 
And the leadership was excellent 

Yeah I think so 

Uh the teamwork was very very good 

And new ideas found 

Come up with new product 
Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think its its a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting
uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that 

We achieved uh project goal I think 

that is within the budget 

yes  more or less 

Without without LCD  without speech recognition  it will be simple 

Yeah thank you for your work and
