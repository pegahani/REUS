Today  functional design phase 

The functional requirements  its uh uh very important for uh the user 

seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly  Um

they want to spend money for a better system  for better remote control 

and um they use yeah  they use zap a lot 

but um uh the relevant buttons are the power  the channel selection and the volume selection 

but uh w and not important in the audio settings  display settings

we can we can hide those under a menu or something 

that was in the test  the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control 
so uh I think its a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it 
And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition

And they want maybe an uh LCD screen

We wanna have a little preview on the remote control  Preview whats on the channel 

Cause it sounds pretty expensive too 

Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel 

it just remembers the channel that you are on most  for example 

Yeah 

some technical functions 

There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear 

Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while 

this is basically what I h had in mind in the fadeproof symbols  locator  a sound 

And possibly also the size  so more important buttons  bigger

but more less buttons  easy  some bigger buttons 

Yeah  its true 

So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere

so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it  then thats cheaper 

You have the the power coming in 

The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor  that thinks over a Morse code 

then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs 
You have infrared

Uh I dont have any personal p uh preferences uh so far 
except for uh the materials to be used uh light  that they are light 

Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore

I dont think we should remove the button 

But I dont think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example 

This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people 

um the younger people were defined under forty 

And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable 
which is apparently black and yellow 

With that concept I started thinking  so why not just steal Nokias idea
and just make changeable covers for your

I think this is a good idea 

I think we should lose the LCD screen 

Y Yes  I think so too 

I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power 

What we could do  what could be possible  is maybe not an LCD screen but with a preview 

For example  a little TV guide 

Im not sure its even possible 

I have to check that out 

I think the p yeah  the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement 
just make a button on your TV

we should go for that 

then uh Id Id like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not 
because thats uh determines everything Im gonna do 

I think its universal  I think we should go for universal 

Speech recognition  I think its very hard 
because were selling across multiple countries 

Besides that  the technology isnt really super yet 

but its just not I dont think the markets ripe for that yet 

you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable 

maybe a little harder plastic

If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers  then we can also make uh a cover for every language area 

But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves

its not even a bad idea 
For example  if your buttons are faded  after I mean if you make a durable remote  they are faded  you can just buy a new cover 

Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve 

its just just a one one piece of rubber for example 

something I have to look into 

you have to come up with a components concept 

you should do some trendwatching 

I think it should be have less or l very little buttons
and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things 
Or maybe just stick em under a menu 

Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu 
because were working with different types of television 

That is true 

I dont think so 

A doublesided remote control 
I dont think thats useful 

but you cant you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of TVs 

because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands  Especially the big ones  the big brands 

if you can put some research into that  if its possible 

I think its possible 

I thi I think so too 

Maybe its a little more curves or whatever 

And uh with different colours uh 

Ill put some on paper
and present them next time uh the ideas that I have 

we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example 

and since youre holding it like this  I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume

Think its like this 

I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own 

Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle 

Yeah  in the middle 

Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it  if you if its lost  for people that are deaf 

but for example if its lost in your armchair  well not see the flash 

We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up 

We could do that 

uh the power button somewhere over here 
I usually press it on top 

Mute 

I think it should be at the bottom somewhere 

Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection 

Shall we uh also look if its possible to make a rechargeable remote 

Im not sure y Im not sure its if its expensive 
but just take a look at it 

to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the TV  Could be flat  you could insert your uh remote into it 

But I think that will cost a lot 
Uh a normal wire would be better 

Im not sure if it costs a lot 

And do people actually want that  To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable 

we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it 

we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station 

I think this is a brilliant product 

because if theyre willing to pay more  we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers 

Could you post some other essentials of what people want 

Where would we want the uh teletext button 

Do we put it somewhere over here 
Or maybe this is something for the next meeting 

draw us up some some designs of of possible
just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big 

we dont want we want very little buttons  just the buttons you use a lot 

because some TVs have the uh possibility to adjust brightness  that kind of menus 

but thats what we stick under the menu button 

Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu 
If it isnt  then we cannot reach it 

But I think most modern TVs have it in their menu 

Uh isnt there a possibility to do research on that  so we know that for sure 

Um they want to pay for an LCD screen and speech recognition 

Oh  were not going to be able to sell it for twentyfive then  with an LCD screen 

Yeah  just look at the possibilities then 

we should do a little thing about design 
because it looks boring really to me 

Different colours maybe 

And the design  it should differ 

lets say that people would want an LCD thing 
Lets take take the basic design again  what we oh  crap uh came up with 

If youre reading from top to bottom  I think its better to put it uh at the top 

How can you use an LCD screen 

But nee the function of it 

So we have three people saying it should be on top 

Do we put the volume control and the channel control here 

In the middle 

Maybe in a circle for example  like we like in this example 

I think the channel button should be in the centre 

but we do agree that we keep this at the centre 

but if we need two batteries and an LCD screen  that means a lot of space that we need 
But it has to be a little bit heavier 

Just to do research into both  w what it costs and what it takes for space 

uh lets give this uh a name  and not like some vague serial number that no one understands  like with cars 

Yeah  lets think of a name  okay 

the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly 

If you rule out functions  then uh and that gets known  then people are not gonna buy it 

I Im not sure
