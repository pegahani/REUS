Well our functional design meeting  thats the stage were in 

Um now the new project requirements  Ill just show them 

Well  teletext goes out 

I I disagree 

because we just said we wanted to d include the DVD
and they dont want it 

because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years 

Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products 

Well  Im going to tell you something about functional requirements 

Well  um the first findings are that people um think most controls are very kind of ug ugly 

They also say  thats about uh I thought it was fifty per cent  uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls 

Uh  almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity 

Furthermore  its uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot 
Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle  so you can reach it with your thumb 

A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room 
So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television  thats your um your control beeps or something  that you can find this very easily 

Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks its its too uh too difficult to learn 

I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote  of course  Uh

Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control  I think 

It sh it should be there  the manual 

Next point  Um RSI 

Um research shows that they like to have a little LCD screen on their on their uh zapping uh device 
Uh I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty  ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that 

Its going to be expensive  Yeah 

I dont have any information on that  So

No  well look well look into that later 

And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition 
They also like that 

I think thats uh difficult to realise also 

We dont rule them out uh yet 

Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design 

You have uh basically uh the energy  the power of the of the remote control 

And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip 

Ive some couple of pictures here 

It has uh very little buttons and

High tech 

and its not very userfriendly 

So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that 
uh so that uh it becomes more userfriendly 

But I think its very important to make um the power  channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb  so you cant have RSI uh consequences 

Uh the power button is used very much  channel selection  volume and teletext 

Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons 

Maybe you can make  for for channel changing  two little buttons on the side of the remote  so you can just do like this 

Yeah  If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote  and he picks up it he he touches the side then hes a already on the next channel 
Thats very irritating  I think 

But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed  and as you say at the thumb 

and uh and that the less important uh buttons  like the the the different channels  uh the numbers one two three four five as well  should be uh yeah well not in reach 

And I have some pictures of the inside workings 

Yeah  Well Im Mike  User Interface Designer 

took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website  which are these two 

Um This one is engineeringcentred 

I like usercentr centred uh uh also the best 

I um I kinda like the shape 

I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh well need 

I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front 

So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it  then uh our recognition is totally gone 

Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote 

We can put it on the on the back side 

And if you put a front on it  theres a hole on the front  So the symbols always on

We can make a symbol of the company right here 

Mike  uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file  In Map 

Yeah  I will 

and weve uh chose for the younger one 
Um  research has shown that um its a high interested uh in features 

but what kind of features 

Like LCD screens and voice recognition 

And if if thats gives you a little bit of sta status information 

Which programme you are l watching or something 

So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have 

I think it should be at the top 

Alright  we go with the LCD screen 

Uh well I think so  yes  Um

Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost 

No but were well have to look into that 

So we have to decide on the different remote control functions 

Yeah but with with the LCD screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural 

because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom 

We dont want them to look like a calculator 

I think its still important to have it at the top 
because its uh its more familiar that way 

I think we have uh a few functions 
and we can put uh the LCD above it 
and still have lots of room at the bottom  where you can put your hand 

Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions 

We have a power button  setting buttons  LCD window  the number buttons

Channel  yeah 
Volume control 

Uh the mute button 

I think we we should use something like this um to um The the channel up and channel down button  Yeah  in circle  you know 
And and a volume control also in it 

You should put that uh power button  channel and volume should have the most uh importance 

I think these should be in one big circle in the middle 

Yeah  but what he said about RSI was t kinda true 

So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other 

Yeah but people dont like it when their buttons are all over the place 

So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart  I think  up and down 

No I dont think 

I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together 
but you dont have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together 

Right  just make some decisions 

Well what if were going to now decide about the functions 
and the design comes into the next round 

Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mikes screen with uh one button that says Im going to do a t two number digital 

On most TVs if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other  d it

Alright so no button for that 

Uh theres um screen  You can make it wider and less wide 

I do think we have to put that underneath a clip 

Th thats a bit uh waste 

You can just put it somewhere

Oh  they can be small or round like buttons 

Well uh and and I think more at the bottom  Yeah 

We have it  and we design later where everything goes  Yeah 

Why go to video 

Yeah  but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh

Yeah  but if were choosing to uh incorporate these buttons  you have to have uh channel setting 

Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah  sk

and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh

So we still have one uh four 

For a screen uh fu uh channel setting 

Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button  for your menu 

Yeah  alright 

Menu button 

Yeah  I think thats important 

I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu  yeah 

And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something 

and uh well have to decide s things on our own I think  So

So its better to uh put our attention to the the design  So you can pick up and use it  than I think 

The chip uh produces Morse code  um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed  of course 

Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the  well its uh very simple  and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the TV set 

but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would reject R RSI RSI 

but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company 

No not clickable 

But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section 

And the button that you can go to AV for your video
