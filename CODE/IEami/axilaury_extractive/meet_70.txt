this meeting will be about the conceptual design 

Um  think of it s kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete 
In this meeting ideally well come to some final decisions on what were gonna do for the prototype 

apologies for the last meeting 
it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough 
um  so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting 

basically all were gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time 

um and well collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting  possible directions 
And then well make some more decisions on um basic
uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work 

basically what Im gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design
and its been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do

Basically what Im gonna be doing is talking to you about that 
Um  components of a remote control  okay  Weve already kind of gone over this
but were gonna have to get into more detail

Energy source  um  our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources  your standard battery  solar cells 
Our manufacturer didnt say anything about lithium

if we do go that route  we might have to look elsewhere 
Um  and also theres a kinetic energy possibility 
Basically  its like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running 

but I dont know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen 

Um  the case  we have a few options  plastic  rubber or wood 
Um and then as far as the way its shaped  we can do standard boring flat 
which we probably dont wanna do 
curved or very sexy double curved 

What kind of th thickness are we looking at 

Um  I imagine that we could specify 

Um  the buttons  there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer 
but to use those wed have to use more chips 

And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um well have to use rubber push buttons
because the other buttons arent compatible with that 

touch screen equals many chips
which equals many Euro 
Um  one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum 
So you notice when you push a button on a remote you cant see anything coming out of it
but in fact there is light coming out of the remote

Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting
was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote  just kind of as a fun gimmick 
So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it 

is there an option that we can have that off or on
so a person can select like

I am sure that we could do that 

just as a fun gimmick 

Um  and then on to the circuit board that were gonna use  also known as the chip 
Uh  we really dont have any way around the TA one one eight three five 

were very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer 
um and my question to all of you is  should we look to other manufacturies
or should we just make do with what we have available 

Id say shop around
but with our time constraints  is that really a feasible option 

Um  if we do go the lithium battery route then well have to go outside our current manufacturer 
My personal preference is

uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route 
just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on 
Uh  I like the idea of the visible light signalling 

and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes 

Um  basically I was looking at whats going on in the remote control market right now
and whats going on in other design fields 
to see sort of whats whats trendy  whats new  whats happening 
Um  remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer  fancier  more exciting

um that we need innovative design options
and there needs to be an easy user interface 
Um the challenge is that current trends right now  across the board in fashion  in furniture  in technology  is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing 
Now Im not saying we should have  you know  tomato shaped remote controls or anything 
but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours 
like if wood is an option  that whole organic  sleek  clean 

Different skin options 

and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy 

though if we can get around to getting piloting  I thought maybe a casing option like uh
not like a skin  but like a holder almost if you could do like um  leather options or wood options or something

As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case 
it has a consistency of those stress balls 

I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now 

but then if the touch screen thing isnt gonna work out for us thats really a nonissue 

I like the idea of of rubber too

I think that goes against the whole fancy something  a new line 

interface concept by your faithful user interface designer 
So yur user interface  guys  is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear  or otherwise uh perceive 
Uh  commands and mechanisms  that basically user uses to control the operator operating system 
Heres a d series of different remote controls
that are out on the market today 

the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts 
Uh voice recognition  we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team

current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples 
um and basically you record your own verbal labels
c and connect them to the remote control 

our design team  research team  has been able to uh set up a system
in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses 
Like you could say good morning uh remote control
and itll say in a sexy female voice  Good morning Joe  Um 

Um  another concept is what uh Apple has come up with  the spinning wheel with uh LC display like on the uh iPod

Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated pushbutton  kind of like a modern a bit bulky  a bit crazy 
I dont think thats were necessarily going for 
And uh some special components  uh ideas like uh blocking  having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming
but uh I again if we go with touch screen I dont think thats a big issue  Um
and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here 
Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose 

so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think were heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing

Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package

Uh touch screen interface  um possibly having goto buttons being uh stuck into the system
so those dont move away from the screen  uh  the important ones like power  volume and jump between channels 
Um  and of course our voice command system which Ive talked a little bit about already
and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around

red for power  um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not 
And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea

Now we kind of have to come to some decisions 

Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think  I dunno  what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point 

I think its our most marketable feature

and all three of us can have a chat about it  Um 

But can we really afford it

My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology its gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote 

thats just an estimate though 

its just  it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean were gonna have to increase the price to make money 

Where do you guys come up with these numbers 

Thats just off the top of my head 

I mean if youre gonna pay for an expensive high class remote  youre gonna expect it to do something

we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins
rather than selling for twenty five  sell em for thirty 
but thats something that we can have finance deal with 
Um  I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen

and we can look into this other manufacturing option 
and maybe we can get em somewhere else cheaper 

lets lets say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here 

I mean I think that we really have two main selling points 

cause with voice recognition

I think that our casing and the voice recognition

I mean  if if were looking at bottom line  now were looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on 
I think we might have to drop the voice rec 

I think wed have to decide between em definitely 

To be honest  we have the capa we have the design inhouse 
I mean weve weve come up with this  with this new voice

What do you think on it Nathan  About the voice rec 

I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up

I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say 

and they said they wanted voice recognition 
Course  maybe they hadnt thought of this whole touch screen option 
but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition

Does having both really up our costs 

I cant see how it wouldnt 

so we have to pick between one of the two  Um 

we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent 
But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction
but if thats whats gonna sell I think thats what we need to go with

I think the voice recognition is simpler 

Is it cheaper to do the VR or to do the uh touch screen 

Um  this is just off the top of my head keep in mind 

but um  since we already have the technology inhouse for the voice recognition
were not gonna have to do as much design work

more or less you guys think that o o of the two of em  the voice recognition will be better 

We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition 

You discussed either a lithium or a solar power 
Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition 

Um  the solar power definitely would be
but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed 

we should install a small backup battery 

we cant guarantee sunlight everywhere

it works about the same as a solar powered calculator 
and you know how those those dont really require that much light 

Im willing to agree with everything thats been said 

If were really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a handheld remote control
and maybe kind of have a round remote control
that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that  kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something 

Why  why moving away from handheld  why 

if you dont need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point 

if its got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job 

Do you think people that are people that buy a remote  are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition

I think were banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people 
like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too 

we have to have buttons on it too as well 

I mean  why not have a little rounded kind of thing 
it could still have the basic buttons on it 

And maybe a menu button and so forth 

use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever

because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote 

Im thinking of the airport portal 
you know like that little pod looking thing 

Im recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing

but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um

Terracotta bowl or something 

And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth  we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel 

if you feel the the tip on this pen its a bit gives just a bit 

something where its uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it 

Just kind of the squishy feel 

lets see if we can do a squishy nonremote controllooking remote control 

um  I guess well a thats gonna be uh a thing  if we run a bit overbudget  that might be okay  um 

Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost 
I just havent been provided that information by our manufacturers

were more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function  you know  not too complex 

although Im not saying we should completely rule out major functions 
they should be secondary  at least if not functionally then visually 

Like maybe have menu things 

If  if were not going the touchscreen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out

and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things 

we could do a slide or a compartment 

Or you know  a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing  like on um like on a DVD player 

we need to figure out what kind of buttons were going to use 
are we going to use scroll buttons  Rubber buttons  Um

it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber

cause since were probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case

I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons

have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people 

because you have different cases
and that might open up your market a little bit obviously 

but obviously having more cases also costs more

you could have uh a  you know  a um uh kind of a natural wood colour  like a stained wood and um  I dont know  olive green or something 
That wouldnt be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing 

lets work on uh multiple case colours 

stick with the same kind of kinda yeah  the same basic nonremote kind of remote design 

well have the next meeting about half an hour  um 

Nathan  Id like you to work on just the basic look and feel 

Um  what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype 
And um Ron if you can
figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple 

Um  and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff 
Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype  um using um prototype building materials um 
And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well
