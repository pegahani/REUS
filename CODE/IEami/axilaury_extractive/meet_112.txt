First I will introduce myself 

Im Bart 

My names Frank 

lets start off um with a little presentation 
Uh Now first Ill tell you a little bit about the setting 
You can see there are a few cameras here 
Theyll record uh our actions
and youll have wires and microphones that will record your voice 

is there a project documents folder 
There are some notes in it already I see  some documents 

I dont know if youve noticed  but uh were working for Real Reaction 

We put fashion in electronics 

uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself 

This is our agenda 
Uh we have our opening acquaintance  tool training  project plan description closing 

then I can take some notes

Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while 

but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down  just write it down 

Um have you all seen the corporate website already 

Have you seen any flaws in it 
I think I found one 

But um on the corporate information side theres a th uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction 

Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control 
It has to be original  trendy  and user friendly 

Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through 
First is functional des uh design  individual work  meetings 
After the functional design  then the conceptual design and the detailed design 

The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design  uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design 
Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design  user interface concept and user interface design 
And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification  trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation 

But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings 

As you can see weve got the smart boards here and here in the white board 
Um in the white board here theres a little tool bar on this side 
Here are some functions 
You can save 

uh these functions we dont have anything to do with 
only undo  you can undo a little uh piece of drawing 
A blank new document for each person 
Uh select a pen 
eraser 

Uh then weve got our pen  This pen 
Its really funny

You can also select the current colour and the line width 

and its easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there 

Weve got our shared folder 

But all you will found that already
because there are a lot of documents in it already 

so if you have a document you wanna show  just open it from the folder 
Here is a simple tool bar 

its save  print  move back or forward one page 
You can switch between the different drawings 
And then were going to try out the white board 

Were going to uh draw animal 
And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics 
Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours  and different line width 

You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child 
Because if you hold it like this  the sensors will get blocked

Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow 
Cause if youre going to draw like really fast then um the pen wont hold up 

we choose form of current colour
uh I think grey is appropriate 

Now youll see my drawing capabilities 

you have to do it real slow 

I was trying to draw a dolphin 

And then you can undo

Maybe you have to hold it a bit upsidedown 

now Im gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you 

Gonna use a different line width 

Maybe its easier to draw the smaller line width  I think 

You have to go really slow when youre writing 

Um Im just gonna draw its uh head 

I was gonna draw a cat too 

its pretty skinny cat 

everybody knows how to work with the white board now 

Yeah 

move along to the project finance 
Um as you can see  we um for our remote control  a selling price is uh twenty five Euros  Our selling price 
Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros 

Uh we can do it international 
so we have to focus on different kind of users  different kind of cultures  and different kind of trends as well 

Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros 

just try to remember these points  Selling price twenty five  profit aims fifty million um  but more important is the int international market were trying to focus on  And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros 

thats leads us to our little discussion 

does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls  and I mean not the ordinary mote controls  but also a little bit different ones  Like you can use for other 

No  me neither 

kind of broad TV at home  and a DVD player 
so we got like a lot of remote controls  one for the TV  one for the video recorder  one for the DVD player 
And I think its it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all 

Ive Ive got one at home 
And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it 

I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control  it makes it a lot easier as well 

weve we want different functions
uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infrared 

And it also operates on infrared 

and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor 

so you have to got the little device inside your room 

Think it has to be shock proof

Sure  yeah 

my remote control tends to fall a lot 

Waterproof 

Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder 

Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it 

how much is left in the battery 
But theyll also really drag up the production costs 
so think well have to see about that too 
But maybe just a little LED 

then Ill put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder 

And we can all work uh on our own projects 

then Ill meet you in about a half an hour  I think
