this is our design 
Uh its pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting 

We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape 

Th So theres this part um which is made of hard plastic  the front 

Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours 
and later well put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything 

And uh were were using different colours 

and the rest of it  the under uh the under side uh of it  yeah  the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium 

Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner 

Its a double R  Yeah the logo

I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons 

the the con the the the  yeah  the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here 
Um um with kind of arrow shapes 

we uh the Okay buttons here in the middle of the of the operators  of the channel and uh volume um changers 

And the video button 

Menu for the LCD screen 

And of course this low part  this is the LCD screen 

And we thought about the logo big in the middle 

And the company slogan  we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo 

the voice recorder is uh at the bottom 

Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle  so that the the a the ends and the fronts is a bit thicker  so th then it falls over your hands 
And how large is it 

Thats the question 

Yeah  I agree with the LCD screen 

And if you have it li in the middle  your hand might be over it 

But you you hold it like this 

Well f for as far as I can see  three of us agree

Well the the Well thats a reason to to to put the LCD screen uh of course on the upper side  but

For me  I I wouldnt buy it 

So let it be like this at uh at this moment 

Im going to do uh the ev evaluation 
Thats gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria 
So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends 

Uh the first question is  uh is the device goodlooking 

So I think its very goodlooking

Easy to change channels 

I think its uh as easy as uh can be made  Uh

The uh device is easy to find if you lose it 

Well we dont have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so 

R RSI sensitive 

Are there enough technology 

Uh well well a bit 

Three 

Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented 

Three  alright 

Is the material attractive 

So I would say at least two 

look at the costs at this point 

My god 

The sample speaker 

Kick it out 

Then we go to fourteen point six 

Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip 

Well be for the LCD uh you had said 

Whats the difference between a simple and a regular chip 

but it wasnt very clear 

Well  we could say  well this special colour  that isnt that that isnt there 
because the the fronts they will buy it  The special colour 

But we d Then we have to lose the LCD screen 

Yeah  we need to have the the LCD screen 

We can also make it flat 

Yeah  this is actually two curves  yeah 

No  its one curve 

W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half 

Well we make it more expensive to buy 

Well  then we have two dollars less profit 

If if you make people brandaware  they are willing to pay more 

Hey but uh I think youll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen  its its very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing 

Why why dont we replace the titanium with uh plastic coloured titanium 

Th then you have a ugly  stupid  l ugly looking  dumb remote that that noone would buy 

Ill put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for thats trendy d these days 
I Ill talk to the managers 

So we have to use the ditch the titanium  Im afraid 

But then we can add the special colour 
As we have money over uh left 

Well I think uh the case is double curved then 

Well y we have curves in all directions 

So alright 

but now were going to evaluate our project  of uh project 

are we satisfactory about our creativity 
I think its terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment 

Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best  yeah 

and you had to dump all your creativity 

Uh leadership

Well its It was very democratic 

Well the managers were terrible  So  with their all their useless requirements 

teamwork 
Well great I think 
Uh well what do you  what did you think about the SMARTboard 

It was a complete disaster 

That one isnt accurate 

But I I think this is meant by the digital pen 

Uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing 

And uh the digi the digital pen 

It isnt practical  Right 

Yeah  it might be useful for drawings  I I agree on that 

N new ideas found 

Well I missed uh the option to uh to email 

Communicate in between 

uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back  part of the titanium uh titanium part 

If if you look if if this this is thick  and this is thin  th th then it that it lies over your hands  But

and only Nils
