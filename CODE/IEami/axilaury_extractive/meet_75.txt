Okay  Um heres the agenda for our last meeting 
Um after the opening were going to have a prototype presentation 
then were going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote 
Then were going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process 

lets have the prototype presentation 

The base is gonna be gunmetal gray  which is what we had decided 
and its gonna be plastic 
Um then theres the latex cover  which is what you see as red 

Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue  almost seethrough 

The whole thing lights up if you press any button  rather than it just that one button will light up 
Um and then at the bottom we have our logo 

And then on the side you have the buttons 

and as youve noticed on our prototype um theyve ended up with a curvature kind of 

I think you did an awesome job 

I dont really know exactly what we should uh talk about 

Feel good meaning what 
Physically 

Yeah  it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it 

Okay so  were using the criteria uh for a seven point scale 

do we feel its very easy to use 

Two  Thats what I say 
Okay  fashionable 

I mean like no  I think its very fashionable 

Ill give it a two  because at the moment its not looking that way 

Mm I dont think its that fashionable 

does it feel good 

And its i it is very ergonomically designed 

Alright  average is two 
Is it technologically innovative 

We could do it with the chip  yes 

does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it 
And theres no way you can represent it on here  Y

so Id probably give it a three 

But it is just a TV remote 

Its just trendy  basically 

Its capable of being squishy and fruity 

So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner 

Okay  so now uh were moving on to finance 

Um its not hand dynamo  its powered by battery  so we give it a

Do I just put quantity being one battery  or

this is where we need to make a final call on if its a lithium or do we wanna go triple As 

Oh  lets just go for a lithium 

And special colour 

Were really having just pushbutton interface 

button supplements the buttons are no

Um theyre uh theyre a special form  cause theyre indented 

Mm  Well  were under cost then 

Weve got eleven point two 

So we can go to production 

Now were gonna talk about the project process

We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself  in restricting us only to using a TV remote  initially 

We didnt have a whiteboard 

And no internet 

Oh  overall I mean I thought we did a good job like

minus it being just merely a TV remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it 

and weve all been a pretty congenial team here  I think 

Yeah  digital pens 

I really appreciated those  yeah 
The use of the laptops for receiving everything 

but my one issue is just like the whole its for TV only 
I was like whos gonna buy a remote just for the TV unless theyve lost theirs 

and now were gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary
