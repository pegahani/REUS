Uh  yeah  Uh  before we begin it  I want to say Ive Ive put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder 

It uh it uh still some technical difficulties
so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read  because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other 

But uh  from now on I wont use my pen anymore  so will be p just ordinary keyboard 

Okay  when we talk about uh components design  um its really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of 

Uh the properties of the case  um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic
uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah  it feels uh good in your hand 

I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case  we must use a rubber pushbuttons to

uh the the rubber doublecurved case is a is a t uh threedimensional uh curve in the in the design 
which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy  Uh

uh the basic battery 
which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh nondepending of of of uh um
Uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah  kinetic uh energy 

Mm  solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls 

uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber  because uh wood or titanium would also be a bit weird 

Oh titanium is probably trendy  I think 

Well  maybe a little bit expensive 

uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf 

all the materials and the components are uh just available in uh in our uh factory 

Um  another possibility  I uh yeah  I looked up on was uh the LCD displays 
Could be uh something special to our uh remote control 
and its possible  but it only cost a bit more 

Yes  maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh

I th I got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one 

um  I still dont have any information about user requirements 
I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh

Oh  we decided upon that in the last meeting 

Yeah  but but then wh I dont know when there are new user requirements 

Well  tha I didnt receive any new requirements or somethi

Well  I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of 

these are the ones you already summed up in the

Uh  I was also looking for what you said  for I got an email uh uh about uh LCD in in in front of the remote control 
I dont know if thats a good idea  or maybe its a little bit too much for twelve and a half  Production 

I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it  Then I got a popups to go to the meeting  But

Um  yeah  Well  the functions are are not more to discuss  I think 

Its its just the base things we already discussed that the no VCR or that kind of

But you do mention the next and previous uh button 

Well  thats next channel  I mean next channel 

And I um uh thinked of the button sizes and Im not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small

Well  w when we only use basic functions  we have the possibility to make the buttons larger 
Well  I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons  th th those two have yeah  they have to be large 

It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big  like t

uh personal preference I didnt have 

Well  Ive done some research again about trends on the internet 

the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control 

The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the RC 

And uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance  the third point  is a high ease of use 

The younger market likes uh
Well  the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material 

Uh  catchy colours 

uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself 

To implement some spongy thing  maybe we can do it in the in the docking station 

Yeah  also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour 

But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christs sake with remote control 

No  but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit 

Yeah  but it that doesnt have to remind you  you know  like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit  but just  you know  like the the the the round curves 

Well  w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things 

And um  maybe  yeah  a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control  but m yeah 

yeah  I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh  a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too 

But pictures of fruit  vegetables vegetables

Maybe its too much  you know 

But  we we have to um There have to be the the the the firm colours  our own uh colours has to be in it 

But I dont think our our company colours are this fashionable 

If this is our docking station  we can make our logo over here 

do we want to um use an LCD display  for example 

Well  its nice  of course  But I dont I dont know what to display on it 

Maybe maybe we can make a TV guide on it  for the channel youre on 

Yes sure  but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large LCD screen  because

Yeah  but no  I do I think its a bit redundant  actually 

Well well what would you display on it then 

Uh  programme uh information or or or or g or a guide

But youre already watching the TV  youre not gonna watch your remote control 

I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an LCD in it 

But I dont think a LCD display fits in that image 

When when you put uh maybe a colour LCD t uh screen on it  its very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from

well  Im coming back to the costs again  but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits 

and really  I dont see how the the LCD display is gonna add anything  you know  on a design level 

Okay  we s skip the LCD display 

The m material  I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber  Uh

Maybe just bring it out in different colours 
but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards  thats also too much 

But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium  as well 

But it it then it uh you cant throw it it  It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff

Uh  I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic 

On the other hand  if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh

Yeah  but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing 

But wha th our basic idea y I mean  you gonna were probably gonna have like two type of materials  like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it 

How many colours are we gonna give it 
Like twotone colour  T
I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons  and the cushions as well should be in another colour 

Not more than two colours I think 
Its a g a little bit too flashy 

Th in that way we have like only the numbers  the power button  skip and volume  and then uh uh ten uh rem

A mute and a teletext and a menu 

I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions  pads and things on the s uh side 

I think colours is very important  because it has to be flashy  but and but it d it doesnt have to be annoying 

I think this is kind of fruity  you know  Just round shapes with uh

Okay  well I think the meeting will be over within a minute 

Well  you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the

In the shared folder 

because Im will now type them out 

Youll see in you email  I guess 

What are we going to do now
