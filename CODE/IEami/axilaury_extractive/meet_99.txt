This is our last meeting 
Um Ill go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting 
Uh and then well have a  the prototype presentation 

Then well go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget 
Um then well do the evaluation 
and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that well need to make 

We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy lookandfeel 

Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles 
Um and a spongy feel 

Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity 

Um the iPod  we really liked the look of that 

the materials for the case  the different energy sources  the different types of chips 
um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote 

basically we we st went with the colour yellow 
Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned  its basically designed around a banana 

These would be like the rubber  the rubber grips 

Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel 

And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod 

And then to access the more complicated functions youd you sorta go  you press that and go through the menus 

we could use the voice 

Its as simple as you  we could make it really 

Plastic covered with rubber 

T the actual thing might be smaller 

Its a quick onoff button 

You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria 

were gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale 
And one is going to mean true  that we did actually achieve that 
With seven being false  we did not achieve that 

So for the first one  we need to decide  did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote 

I think its definitely different than anything else out there 

Id say  when it comes to the ergonomics  the form and stuff  yes thats definitely more beautiful than your average 

So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh  we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly  definitely 

I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form 

Four is fair 

Did we make it simple for new users 

Its very intuitive  I think yeah 

Um  do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users 

Cause weve weve brought it down to basically four controls most common  which are channel and volume 

So thats a one 

How about the problem of a remote being easily lost 

Something that big and that yellow you just dont lose anymore 

But um if we were to  if we were  that  the speech recognition  That  we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing 

Y you could add an extra feature actually 
Which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television 

That cant cost much 

Lets add one of those features and say yes 

Two 

Are we technologically innovative 

Its all just stolen technology when it comes down to

I dont know that we are that innovative  to tell you the truth 

Um I would say were probably at four 

Um spongy material 

We have some spongy  yeah 

Its not a one though 

Probably a four at most 

did we put the fashion in electronics 
Id say we did 

Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the LCD and the way you operate it than the form and the colour 

Now we just gotta calculate 

Okay well say two point four two 

Now we get to do the budget numbers 

We want a fifty percent profit on this 

Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take 

Two 

Thats the advanced chiponprint  yeah 

Kay then the case is a Probably its double curved 
Case materials are

Plastic 

Thats not a special colour 
Its a specially ugly colour  but its not special 

Well we only have one button so really we shouldnt be charged 
we shouldnt be charged anything for the the button supplements 

So our total is fifteen point five 

by three Euros over 

What if we completely took out the the one single button weve got on 

I suppose the LCD C displays the one thats pushing it up a bit though 

you could maybe take out the LCD dis display even 

Right  We may not need it 

I think that perhaps the project evaluations just supposed to be completed by me 
But Id like to hear your thoughts 

Uh h what did you think of our project process 

yeah I think we did quite well  Um

Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning 

But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing 

and um I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things 

Super super 

I had some problem with the pen I think 

Minus your PowerPoint fiasco 

Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary 

And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting 

Um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up 
And then well have to check with the main boss whether we can  what goes on after that
