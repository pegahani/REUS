Now uh  I ask you to presentate the prototype 

This is it 

Its uh its uh its yellow 
And uh  this is rubber 
And and and this too 

And the rest is hard plastic 

the sides 

We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside 
And then it covers the these buttons

And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick 
So  you can still operate uh all the things 
Because you dont always use the menu 

And the buttons 

Big buttons 
And everything is blue  except the power button 

yeah  and the mute and the the other button 

And the joystick is for the volume and the channels 

Very obvious 

Up is channel up 
Down is channel down 
To the right is volume up 
To the left is volume down 

Okay  so if joystick and LCD 
Whats the RR

RRs the l the the the the company uh logo 

Thats on the rub rubber part 

So  what they say on the side is put fashion there 

So  thats it  Thats prototype 
Now  the finance 

Do we change the the order 
Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first 

Finance is um

first uh
Yes  We have to evaluate the product yet 
Sorry 

Um  we gonna do the evaluation now  together 

I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias 
uh based on um our marketing strategy  on uh the latest trends  on user preferences 
Uh  we have a seven point scale from uh true  as well  To false  seven 
And on base of each c uh criteria  we need to um give a rating 

Um  well uh we have the Word document

Uh  what this just an example  So  this not very important 
But um  if I can get a number in here 

Um  so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative 
Uh  and then we have to uh agree on the rating together 
And in the end  we will c uh count an average of all rating 

Yeah  I think its uh Uh  well technologically using  its not uh it doesnt contain many new features 

Um  I think I will give it a yeah  yeah  yeah  a four 

I think the scrollbutton is something also uh new 

I think technologically Ill give it an seven 

So now i I think you uh see it um its statement 
And you true or false 

Oh  true or false 
Oh  uh Ill Ill give it uh a t a two 

Two 

Its a one  The first item 

Um  this product is for all sorts of customers 
Well  its a statement which uh I disagree with  because we uh really aim uh at at young market
and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow  its not uh really aimed for all customers 

Thats uh a six 

Mm  four 

So I think its four 

I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons 

Maybe version uh three point O uh has other colours 

We put the fashion in electronics 

Yeah  well do we do this with uh this product 

I think if we do this  as its uh uh c uh its really orientates on the design 
Um  so I would give it a two 

Me too a two  because only the battery is not uh techin uh technologically high standard 

Uh  I say uh a five 
Its not fashion  its new 

Then make it th three 

The next element um is the product looks good 
Well personally  I do not prefer a um remote control thats fully in yellow 
So  I would give this a five 

I give it a one 

Well  I say three 

Uh uh  the next statement  It has not too much buttons 

I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better 

Well  uh if we go to uh this fashion  I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers 

So  I would give this a two 

One 

Me too  One 

It does not get lost easily 

Yeah  did we implement uh the sound 

Yes 

No  we did not 
So  but can it get lost if its such a thing 

Ah  Yellow 

I dont think so 

It wont get between uh the pillows uh on the couch 

A one 

Yeah  o one 

Okay  um well we aimed for the younger market 
Uh yeah  did we achieve that 
I think with the way it looks and um it is designed  I will give it a two 

Theres a fancy lookandfeel 

That that was uh  yeah  one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said 

Well  lets also give this a two 

I gave this a one because of the rubber 

Yeah  f very fancy trendy 

Its a a bit personal  If its fancy 
So I think s two is better 

uh it goes with the latest trends 

No  its new 
Innovation 

If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people  and they ate uh fruit and vegetables 
well it has a um a nice colour  uh well compared to food

We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that 

Well go for a three 

I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round 

But the the colours are um basic  like yellow  red  um blue 
Something what also younger people want 

Two 

So um  come back to the presentation now 
So  we find yourself there 
and now we have to calculate an average rating 

Effort is three  ten and twelve  Thirty  forty  fifty  
Twenty one 
So  its uh two and three nine two and one third 

So uh  thats a pretty low rating  I think 

So  its good 

So  according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job 

Next  Finance 

So  now uh we have a product 

But uh  is it cheap enough 

We have a battery 

Cheapest there is 

Electronics  Advanced chip 

its the most advanced 

We have the simple  regular and advanced 
We have the adva advanced 

We have double curved 

we have half rubber  half plastic 

Special colour 
Yes  yellow 

So  we have the LCD
We have two scrollwheels  Or one 

One 

And its not really a s

Joystick uh thing 

Now  uh button supplement 
Special colour 

The buttons are regular colour 

Its too expensive 

Fifteen Euros 

So  we have to change something 

well uh when we lose one scrollwheel  its okay 
Cause we cant lose the battery 
We cant lose the advanced chip 
We cant lose the double curve 
We have rubber  special colour 

Uh  I dont think its a very special colour 
Yellow  Uh  is it a special colour 

For a remote control  I think it is 
If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick  For up down left right 

Um  then we uh lose two Euros 
Then we have thirteen Euros 

Exactly the special colours 

Half a Euro too much 

Um just only plastic or only rubber 

One Euro discount 

I think we have to keep the LCD 

And if you say its just a r uh normal colour

Normal colour  and the the joystick away 

But if you lose the joystick  its still uh an advanced chip 
Or its then a regular 

The advanced chip was for the LCD

If we lose the LCD  then we have an uh regular chip and no LCD 

Then youll have to m uh see the menu on the television 

And then uh we move the the colour 

No joystick  Pushbuttons  No special colour 

And you cannot use the red and green button 

So  all the buttons has to have to be the same colour 

Whats the normal colour 

Very good 
Now  uh project eva evaluation 

process  Went good 

I think uh the creativity uh was good enough 

Uh leadership 
Yeah  you were the project project manager  and uh had the final vote 

Teamwork okay 

New ideas found 
Nope 

I I espe I especially uh liked the the means 
the the SMARTboard

Yeah  I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices 

Well  the laptops if you have them out front of you  you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation 
Um  well uh the drawboard  well you can draw things  But it not really going very convenient 
Uh  maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor

Um  and uh the project  Yeah  I agree on what was said uh mainly 
Uh  yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others 
And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking 

I think it was good 
Not too many discussions 
So  its good for the speed 
So  I think were ready 
Good price 
Evaluation ready
