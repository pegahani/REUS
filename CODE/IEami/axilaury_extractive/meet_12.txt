Okay so were here to talk about the detailed design of the product 

And heres the agenda for this meeting 
Uh Im just gonna open  say a few boring words to start with again  and start taking minutes afterwards 
You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product

And then were gonna evaluate it 
Then were gonna talk about finance 

Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department  which is us  is uh fifteen point eight Euros 

we implemented the basic functions 
which is just TV functions plus the locator 

cradle 
scroll wheel for uh the the channels 
and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping  your favourite channels functionality  in the scroll 

Scrolling through your favourites list 

I like the the the the logo on there as well 

Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here 

so this is the cradle unit 

This is the teletext 

So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use 
So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here 
and the red area is like a rubber covering 

and the buttons are all gonna be rubber  so its pretty hard to actually damage it um

could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it 

Yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem  but if you drop it

I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well 

but I think we might scale down the final model a bit 

So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the wheres my remote 

Beep beep beep 

And um theres one other feature that we were debating  but we decided to go against it 

we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger

but we couldnt figure out what button is important enough to put there 
And we we dont wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so

But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling 

So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit 

But its definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that 

So well leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people 

My my s my suggestion is were gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions 

So youre not gonna find my uh my folder up there
I gotta do mine up at the board 

No its not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldnt create it 

And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh 
And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market 
Weve got the features 
we have the uh characteristics 

The the corporation stands behind the product  okay 

weve got you know the features that make this a unique product  Um

we have reliability  we have comfort  we have ergonomics  we have environmentally s sensitive 

One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product  a normal use guarantee 

it has the features and the characteristics  and the background  I believe  to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros 
Were gonna be competitive  and were gonna were gonna have a market niche 

would you a argue that that were better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could  but lowering our profit margins 

for my evaluation  based on what our competition is  I th I think that that we can go after this

and at that cost I think it uh theres nobody else thats putting this this combination of of ingredients together 
The only limitations I see to this is that were focused on television only 

Theres gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesnt work for my DVD and my but I like these other things  so they keep it  they dont take it back 
Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable 

W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff  but

Yeah  the plus theres the the risk of making it unusable as well  or making it less
b because at the moment its actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons 

Okay so we can talk about finance now 
So I have a little spreadsheet for us

Ive made a f few assumptions here in that Im assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros 

which I think is probably fair considering that we have inhouse manufacturing of power adaptors already 
Uh and Im assuming that the locator beacon 

uh can be made for a similar price to uh an LC display 

um I do think we that we we uh dont need the events chip on print  we only need the uh the regular chip on print 

Is that a singlecurved rather than a doublecurved 

Its singlecurved 

So we come bring it down to Fifteen point four 

See its a little bit more than f singlecurved 
So yeah its fifteen point eight 

we havent talked about any special colour though

if were going for greys and silvers then I dont think were

is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll 

Thats a scroll 

then we have fifteen point eight Euros 

Were on to the patontheback part of the presentation 

How how have we done today 

I think we did pretty well 

No  I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept 

Okay so th th what about um room for creativity 

Sh I think there was plenty of room 

I think we we ended up being quite creative there 

we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us

yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess 

It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was

These cables suck 

So yeah the the pen came in alright
and its a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works 

What new ideas have we found 

Well we had the favourites list  and the scroll bar  and we have the cradle  and the r uh remote call feature 

Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice 

And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon 

Are the costs within the budget 

Not the original budget  but they are now 

So we need to close this meeting 

Is the project evaluated
