Do you know how how I can wake it up 

Ive lost my screen  Uh

Never close your laptop 

Well  welcome to the kickoff meeting 

Well  this is the agenda for today 

examples of the tool training  project plan discussion and the closing 

Okay  the project aim is to design a new remote control 
Uh  some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original  trendy  and userfriendly 

Um  I oh forget I forget the whole acquaintance part  but we we all know each other 

Uh we begin with the functional design  then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design 
Every uh level of design consists of some individual work  and we uh close it with a meeting 

Okay  first were gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here  so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools 

This is the presentation boards  wh which one Im using right now 

theres a document folder called um the sh shared document folder 

so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen 

There is a toolbar over here 

Its like a very simple uh paint application 

and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button 

and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward 

Right  were gonna try out the electronic whiteboards 
Uh  every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics 

Well  Im gonna draw um a p piranha  Uh  a fish 

And uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths 

but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird 

and then we are uh through the tool training  I guess 
Okay  this is uh something about the project finance 
The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros 
And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros 

The market range is international  so its gonna be sold worldwide 
and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control 

well  were gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control its gonna be 

I dont th I dont think the four of us got problems with remote controls 
but if you see elderly people  all these buttons  and then they buy new TV because their previous one was stolen or whatever 

Uh  so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with
uh grouped buttons  you know 

And uh  is it gonna be a remote control thats um what it can be used for different kind of equipment  like your TV and your home stereo 

Well I was I was thinking uh since a TV is uh mostly used together with a VCR or DVD player or recorder  and not with a stereo  I think it should be good to include functions for VCRs and DVD players  recorders 

I thought it was only for television 
So so we probably dont have to have to uh have the functions for DVD player or VCR 

Yeah  but most television remote controls support other functions as well 

Or someth something special  like uh MP three player inside of it  or uh

Okay  Maybe with different type of fronts or uh

Im gonna wri uh write some stuff down

Im gonna make some minutes or take some minutes 

The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design  of course 

The User Interface Designer

the technical functions design 
And the Management Expert of uh the Marketing Expert  User requirements specifi

Well see each other in uh thirty minutes
