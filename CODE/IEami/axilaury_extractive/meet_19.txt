So today is um our third meeting 
It will be about the conceptual design uh 

um  We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons
and we are not decided about u the use of LCD screen on on the remote control because of costs 

Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point 

So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform

I investigate deeper the preference of the users 

What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device 
After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking 

what they what they find more more interesting  more or more important its uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel 
So now more more cool aspect  ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with
instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things  a device which is pleasant to to watch  to see 

all this fashion its its fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables 
And also in the in the USA the the current the mor the most popular feeling its its a spongy 

What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy 

I didnt miss and I saw that the fruit  there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes 

So were not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana 

Vegetable textures and all this kind 

So which fruit are you thinking of 

I ha I havent thought of any particular fruit 
but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable 

instead of vegetable  some natur mm uh natural object or something 

or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the

No  not n not not too much focus  not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different 

Im not  Im not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though 

like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner 

Is fruit cool 

Okay  but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know 

Well  probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of 

a cucumber 

Maybe too long 

and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a LCD on a banana also 

and also its Im not convinced about this LCD

Uh do you want a an LCD with twenty five Euros 

youre simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons 

Okay  So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit 

So you are User Interface guy 

It means that it can recognize  it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that 

I guess you could build that in  you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control 

but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done 

Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords 

its itll recognize uh I guess keywords  but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase 

So this is not s really to do to to do control 

Its designed its designed as a fun kind of thing 

yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view 

So this is out of discussion 

I think it doesnt really add much to the functional design and its its its not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine  so

Ive just done a quick mockup of uh uh some of the features of our potential funkylooking uh remote control

But um  Ive just indicated here  we could have actually two scroll wheels 

But I think its important  you know  to have two scroll wheels because  you know  you want one for for the channel  but you also want one for for the volume 

Ive also included this turbo button

because I think  you know  every design should have a turbo button 

so with this turbo button you can  say  skip over t channels if uh  you know  if Im if Im going if Im scrolling past them

but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need  um 

its just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause its hard to get so many buttons on a banana

well  I guess you need an on and off switch 
but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe  you know 

So i it looks like were going completely to forget about the LCD thing 

I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so 

No we can we cant use that 

Well  I f I think its probably more than  than our can handle because its designed for a coffee machine  you know  to say hello in the morning 

I dont I dont know if that speech recognition is  you know  even if we can do it  I think its not really appropriate for uh television environment 

It might be useful to have some kind of base station 
even if its just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping  you know  this is a way of finding the remote 

So this is going to be about the component design 
So first thing is we need power source for the remote control 
So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies 
one is the usual batteries which are there 
they could be chargeable batteries if theres a basis station kind of thing
and on top of that we can have solar cells 
when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so itll be pretty uh innovative kind 
Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls its not broken directly into pieces 

I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy 

and then it should be double curve 
The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve 

with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve 

but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one 
itll bring the cost down

Yeah but its more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood 

but are we set on the banana idea 

the shape of a banana is not its not really handy 

Yes it is 

Yeah  okay  so capsicum or pepper  Yeah 
I dont know  it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me  like

But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top

Okay  so push buttons for the traditional users so that they dont feel they are alienated 

Then uh there are different kind of chips 
one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip 

Pricing is a factor for us  thats why well go for the regular chip 

So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana 

Uh  so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better 

or as hearing is concerned  we can have some gap at some place 

so our TV remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like VCR DVD players which are usually attached with the TV 

It depends  if we like  if we are concentrating on like a fruit design  then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit  you know  like a different fruit for each device 

So youre having the basis station and there is a button 
if you press that button wherever the remote itll start beeping so you know where the remote is  Uh

I think thats a pretty handy feature 

Yeah but Im a bit worried about the budget 

basis station is nothing more  just its a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh youre having one socket on which the thing sits 

LCD has already been ruled out  ASR has been ruled out 

Im just wondering actually  cause  you know  I this whole fruit thing with the banana  its um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche  like only a few people would really want a banana 
but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana 
You know  rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana  you could make it kind of silver 

If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana 

maybe like still in the shape of a banana 

Um  but you know  just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana

Before before st before ending the meeting Id like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype 

So we need to take some de decisions about um about what were going to do 

so were going for a stylish banana shape 

Well have a base station extra uh on the side 

So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis 
Uh  we have a RF for um for beeping for beeping 

and your tur turbo turbo uh button 

Yeah  which I think its its probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device 

And and you have two wheels 

Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well 

Well  I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote

But you know our targets are very high  means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make 

You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design
and you have to work on the user interface 
in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype 
Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation
