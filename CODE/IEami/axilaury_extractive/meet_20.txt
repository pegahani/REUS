So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control 

Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting
then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two 

And well have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts 
Then well have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing
and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro 

No LCD  no speech recognition technology  okay 
we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control 

And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost 

So final design  Final design 

well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh
the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that its not gonna tip over

Weve got the two uh uh scroll wheels here
which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel
and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button

This is a teletext button 

Whats the use uh of the t turbo button already 

This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th

Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops 

If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button  so it switch ons the switch ons the TV 

once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext  they are no more for channel or vol volume 

And this is the uh the infrared uh port 

in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana 

And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas 

And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries
and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries 

Its its uh its about the weight of a banana 

And we have put these different colours so that people dont mistake them mistake it as a banana 

I dont really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station 

Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station 

No eight or eight or ten hours of working 

If you are just leaving like that itll be much longer 

Pricing is was a factor so thats why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip 

And what about people who want to use digits 

Yeah  So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape 

So we have to go through now evaluations 

I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements 

so we must users must say i if its true or is or if its false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven 

Why this strange factor of seven 

Because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale 

I think I sh I I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard 

Okay lets lets evaluate if its fancy or

Yeah  its fancy  according to me 
Seven  Seven by me 

Yeah uh five 

but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason

like Id I think its probably more handy than my current remote  cause of the scroll wheels

Functional 

Ill give five 

Well it depends when you say functional  do you mean it does what we want it to do  or d does what it does  you know  can it make you coffee 

Actually I dont know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro

Well its not a universal remote 

Four 

Okay cool  Cool device 

There Ill give it seven 

For a TV the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature 

I would say five 

I say I said seven 

Of course Ill buy the banana 

Ill say five 

I find it quite cheap actually 
I dunno  If i i it depends  if you live in in Switzerland or you live in

Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or

I dont want a banana on my living room table  a banana remote 

Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home hell at least ask once what is this 

dont forget who were targeting also

No  its I  I would buy

I dont think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control  really 

So you say two 

I say five 

If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro  if that was like my limit  maybe I would buy it 

I stick to five 

will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana 

No uh lets say Ill put two 

If it was change my remote control of my DVD player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to

Id say a three 

So its somewhere three point five I think 

So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling  We can had uh have a out of these numbers  which which is that well we should go for it 

Um well we are going to calculate the production costs 
We should we should be below twelve point five 

Well we decided against the solar cells so

I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing 

No kinetic also 

So we have the regular chip on the print  which is one 

And we have sample speaker 

Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we were not using that 
were just using the the very beep simple beep 

Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing 

So we well put some extras  if there is something 

I put single curved 

To reduce the cost  its okay 

So we stick to plastic  it cost nothing 

Too expensive 

Well no didnt we say we wanted to do a rubber

Okay so special colour  yellow 

We dont have any push buttons 

We have three 

We have two scroll  and we have three push buttons 

Okay its gonna have to be plastic 

but you know the turbo button does add that extra class 

So I mean if were if were over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that 

Make it plastic instead of rubber 

Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic 

So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything whichll go

so we have margin for that stuff 

So what do we do with the extra profits 

Um well invest in R and D 

So we can go to through to project evaluation 

No we have a product which none of us would buy 

Okay so um project process 

Well in fact I I did not know I didnt know really what to say here 

Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen  not that much 

I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity 
And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people were targeting 

Yeah maybe we should go through  yeah an uh evaluation 

Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of
pointless 

So but I think thats something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market 

I think thats actually something that should be in version two  is the ability to you know to control things other than the TV

I think we we can go

Okay so thanks very much
