Um well this is the kickoff meeting for our our project 

so were designing a new remote control and um

Um  as you can see its supposed to be original  trendy and user friendly 

Um and so there are three different stages to the design 

So were gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it 

And repeat that process three times 

So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it 

My favourite animal is like
A beagle 

Uh  right  well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family 
And  yeah that they have lots of personality

Well  my favourite animal would be a monkey 

Then theyre small cute and furry 

and I kind of like whales 
They come in and go eat everything in sight 

M my favourite animal is my own dog at home 

Um hes very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you 

Um so according to the brief um were gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro 

And uh we dont want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros  so fifty percent of the selling price 

but selling price is is that wholesale or retail 

I imagine it probably is our sale actually
because its probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want  Um 

I mean do you think the fact that its going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all 

Well right away Im wondering if theres um th th uh  like with DVD players  if there are zones 

um as well as uh characters 
um different uh keypad styles and s symbols 

cause you have more complicated characters like European languages  then you need more buttons 

Im thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region  whereas in another itll be different  so

thinking  kay trendy probably means something other than just basic 

Like how much does  you know  a remote control cost 
Well twenty five Euro  I mean thats um thats about like eighteen pounds or something 

thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or

so I dont know how how good a remote control that would get you  Um 
But yeah  I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky 

I just dont think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits 

I I mean one one way of looking at it would be  well the people producing television sets  maybe they have to buy remote controls 
Or another way is maybe people who have TV sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something 

My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house 
So um for them it was just how many devices control 

So extra functionalities 

So  like  I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market 

so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses

Right  so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know 
do your your satellite and your regular telly and your VCR and everything 

maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots 

You keep losing them 

W You get those ones where you can  if you like  whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep 

Maybe we could think about how  could be more  you know  streamlined  S

Maybe like a touch screen or something 

Or whatever would be technologically reasonable 

Um so inbetween now and then  um as the industrial designer  youre gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it

Um for user interface  technical functions 

Um and uh marketing executive 
youll be just thinking about what it actually what  you know  what requirements it has to has to fulfil

Yeah  so its th the functional design stage is next  I guess 

are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television 
Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features 

I think one factor would be production cost 

I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it
