This is the functional design meeting 

Okay  heres the agenda for the meeting 
After the opening um I am going to fulfil the role of secretary  take the meeting minutes 
And were gonna have three presentations  one from each of you 

First we need to determine the user requirements

First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting 

And then were going to determine the technical functions  what is the effect of the apparatus 

And then lastly were going to determine its working design  how exactly will it perform its functions 

the function of a remote control  as what uh weve been informed  is basically to send messages to the television set 
for example  switch it on  switch it off  go to this channel  go to channel nine  turn the volume up  etcetera 

whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen  things like that  all the more complicated functions of menus 
And we can decide if thats what we want   um if we want to include that on the remote  if thats something that would stay on the TV itself  for example 
These are two examples 
Um and you can see on the left  its got a lot more buttons 

And then on the right  its a lot more simpler 

And then lastly  its just the questions that we want to consider
like what functions do we want it to include  and how simple  complex it should be 

Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements 

okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab 
and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire 

Seventy five percent think theyre ugly 
Eighty percent want theyve are willing to spend more  which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier 

And we need we need it to be simple  yet it needs to be hightech looking  So

What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user  like they have to press the buttons 

I I think its like the engineering versus user 

and users dont really need all of the buttons that are contained on there  because they only use ten percent of the buttons really 

And so people say that they typically lose it 

and RSI  Im not very sure what that is 

Do we really need t to provide more information on what RSI is 

Uh yeah  thats what my web site said 

I think that we should go with something thats more userfriendly 

And also we found our team found that speech recognition is its like an upandcoming thing

Didnt they um didnt our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the TV and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it

We could definitely include that if we wanted to 

Kay  Uh I didnt get a chance to complete this one  cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating 

We need a power source  were gonna need a smart chip if were gonna make it multifunctional 
Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip 

Um power source  I figured  batteries 
Typically a remote has either two double As or four triple As  sometimes three 

so a large onoff button would probably be good 

Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness 

but the other bulb  I think  is good to just to indicate  Im doing something  its sort of like a reassurance 

Like that we know the batterys working 

We should make it glow in the dark 

Well  should it be larger buttons in general 

I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles 

New product requirements 
First its only going to be a TV remote 

so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote 

But its becoming outdated now  because of the Internet 

Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news 

Would it just be universal for everyone  you think 
Because I think even if something has large buttons  as long as they are not childishly large  like even technically
nontechnically challenged people are gonna use it 

so were going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range

we we need a like homing device 

and if you d leave your phone somewhere  you push the button to find it  and it finds th the phone beeps for you 

And on the charger  just like a phone  like you get a portable phone and its got a charger 

Well  if you have the base  you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery 

Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually 

If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic 

Its really the people twenty five to thirty five 

and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device  too 

And dont forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo 

We could just have the logo in yellow 

The ID is going to work on the components concept 
um UID the user interface concept 
and youre going to do some trend watching 

or maybe a yellow light for the keys 

If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it  just like yellow with the RR 

So no DVD  no TiVo  no stereo 

Well  do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine 

Well  we definitely need those 

So weve simplified  we dont need all those um play  fastforward  rewind 
or no menu buttons 
So weve pretty much pared it down to onoff  volume  mute  channel up and down  um the numbers

Yeah  audi audio settings and screen settings  we need those

or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself 

I think that thats fine just for the TV 

you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons 

So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed
