mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time 

Uh in this meeting I Im going to discuss about the trend watching 

We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey  but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market 

when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good 
rather than having a functional look and feel uh good 

The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative 

And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use 

and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language  something 

When we did uh f fashions uh  recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that

because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes  shoes  and everything with fruits and vegetables 

the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look  hard look 

Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff 

The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co

okay  so the interface concept um 

Um so the method  we looked at existing designs 

Okay  so most remote controls use graphical interface 

Um and we also found that theres inconsistent layout  which makes it confusing 

but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons

And weve got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you 

Theres um an LCD thing 

I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us 
This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse 

Um and But Im not exactly sure how youd use that 

But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side 
But I presume that the functions must come up on the TV screen 

Again thats just quite boring shape  grey 
looks quite spaceagey  but too many buttons  I think on that one 
Um this one I thought was really cool 
Its w its got the programmability function that we talked about 

and its quite an organic shape

Yeah  I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um  Ive seen a lot of them with the the cover missing 
So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever 

And this one  the oversized one 
I dont know about you  but I think its a bit too gimmicky 

I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything 

and Ive just got an email from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in 

I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good 

you program it like you say  record  um and then  play  and then  record  play machine  and stuff like that 

the raised symbols I thought were good 
the LCD  it does look smart  but I think maybe for our budget 

cause I think were definitely going for the speech recognition 

But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more 

Its still its still got to get within our twelve fifty  you know 

Im not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost  

Although  th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the LCD technology now 

And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use  so I think Im not sure about the LCD 
Its a its great  its a good idea 
but for our budget and for the thing were trying to go for eas easy to use  its not the thing we should go for  I think 

we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape  I think 

Well  si since were going for the uh the k the sort of company colours  I think your lemon wasnt that far s

I like I like the colourful buttons as well 

I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff 

And the mouse one  I thought it was a good idea 

Childfriendly  I thought this was good 

I guess there are a lot of options that were gonna have to choose from among 
and Ill Ill give you the uh  I guess  technical considerations for those 
And Im gonna use the whiteboard 
just cause we havent used it 

the way Im gonna do this is uh were gonna take a look at some old remote controls  see how they work 

and then well throw in our new innovations um

Um you open it up  theres a circuit board inside 

and theres a a chip  a processor 
the TA one one eight three five  which um receives input from the buttons 

Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier 
which is made of some transistors and amplifiers  opamps 
and then that gets sent to the uh to the LED light 

Um  So you know  as we said  we got the outer casing 
which we have to decide  you know  whats it gonna be 

processor  um well probably use the more advanced processor than they had 

Um so for the casing  uh this an email I got from our manufacturing team
uh  you know  we have a bunch of options from wood  titanium  rubber  plastic  whatnot 
um latex  doublecurved  curved 

Well  I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it 

And that would k also give it kinda durability

and ther thats also f sorta relatively cheap to cast 

so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath 

I like the rubber  the stress balls  I think 

w like  cause theres gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours

So multicoloured buttons 

or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multicolour so it it doesnt look too childish  perhaps 

Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well 

I mean doublecurved sounds good to me if were talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use 

Like uh an hour glass kind of figure 

Okay  like we could have a big banana shaped remote control 

Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip  Yeah 

How would you point it 

We could have a little LEDs on each end 

y Im Im not sure about the banana idea 

it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe 

I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape 

So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable

Like a gourd almost  or a squash of some sort 

you dont necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape 

Or we can do something  we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey  let the public choose what they want 

Theres a good man  Theres a good idea 

Yeah  what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition 

uh I could put the microphone here 

Okay  well we can do some user test with scrollwheels  right 

Uh speech recognition  I think 

So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or

What about the glowinthedark thing  the strip around it 

I mean how good is the speech recognition thing 

do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends its a fruit 

l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh  I dunno  an apple 

But yeah  about the speech thing  it doesnt have to be hand held or close 

we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes 
different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece 

button will be on the upper side  buttons will be the on the upper side 

So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything  we will just design casings fruit shape 

s I guess we decided on material 

So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel 

Well  I Im not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing 

and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick 
but something ergonomically shaped and organic  like good to hold  based on fruits and natural things like that 
because al already were going a bit gaudy with the yellow  you know 

So again I mean like we could have  uh I mean  we could quite easily have the the main body be a different

I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour 

So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing 

Um as for the energy source um  you know  almost every remote control uses just batteries 

We can use a handdynamo 

So  this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab  you can shake it if its out of power 

But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo  tha these type of cells 

It does leave them with an obligation to

Uh theres solar power  Um 

Uh  solar power will w also not be a good idea 

I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea 

so that not only it doubles as a stand  but um for using it as uh recharging it  but also for using it as sound recognition 

having a rechargeable stand 

and if we if were just having buttons and the speech then were getting our cheapest option of chipping 

I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next 

and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay 

uh our next meetings in half an hour

Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches 

Okay  Save everything to the shared documents  is that right 

You have to keep your pen separate  because I used your pen 

I wonder if they mean like literally make it  sort of buttons and everything 

Or we are going to discuss something 

Uh no  I think thats us our discussion over

Um uh well probably get questionnaire in a minute 

There we go  Warning  finish meeting now
