welcome back fro to the second meeting 

the first presentation well be looking at is Poppys presentation 

I will take this time just to apologise 
I  I only  uh  received my emails later on  Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing 

Um  so I was looking at how were going to go about the working design 

Uh  on a functional side of things  we found out that wh from our previous meeting  we decided that therere certain points that will make our product unique 
Um  one is the visibility in the dark 

And we could use illuminated buttons 

Or we could use fluorescent materials

Um  also we could use um an alarm 
So if we lost the um remote control  perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself  which you could press 

Um  another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design 
Um  from previous researches Ive carried out on other projects  um weve learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory 
So they can be heated and um and cooled  and they change the shape of um the metal 

So um  the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life  if it was heated  um everything would spring apart 
So  all the um individual components could be easily separated  and then some could be reused  some could be recycled 

I mean  the user would return the p product to the company 
cause its the products responsibility to get rid of what theyve made 

Would we be the company that would break down these  or uh metals 

One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector 
Um  so well have to investigate how much that will cost us  cost the company 

Um also there is um components 

But I havent put this plan together yet 

This would actually show the circuit diagram 
Although I havent come up with the final circuit yet 

I it just shows what sort of energy source 
It could be a battery 

And  um  the next presenter will be Tara 

Therere two functional design options 
A multifunctional remote control  which can be used for several entertainment devices 
And a single function remote control  used specifically for the television 

Um  multifunctional controls can be difficult to use  as the multitude of buttons can be confusing 
A single function remote control is simpler to use  but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices 
Um  I think that a single function remote control would be preferable 

Itd be more compatible with a range of television sets  making it more internationally sellable 

And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic 
And less functions would have to be included 
So it would be cheaper to make 

So as far as we know  um  a single function television remote control is us usable internationally 

Um  I was just wondering about the  what  what Genevieve said before  about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing 
And that would probably  um  I d  well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design 

Does anyone object and  and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go 

because were trying to do so much  that if were trying to make a unique  userfriendly  dadada  and its also multi also multifunctional  um  were gonna go over budget for one thing 

And with this well have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design 

Okay  So Ill be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control 

Um  Ive done some marketing research  a lot of interviews with remote control users  um  and some internet research 

and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose 
So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products 
Um  hence our motto  we put the fashion in electronics 

Um  and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design  Not just in electronic fashion 

Any trends that are going on in  in the public  even media 

Um  seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly 

Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy 
Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user 

Um  seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot 

Um  and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons 

so it might be very appealing if  um  we have very concise buttons 
And another thing with um lots of surfing  wed probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable 

And actually to go with that  Im gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons  how much theyre used 

Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour 

Teletext  um  now Im not too clear on what that is 

its just information that um  like television timetables  whats on  whats on now  whats on next  on every channel  and

So it looks like something that were gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control 

Um  and has a r a high relevance of six point five 

Remote controls are often lost somewhere 

Um  remote controls are bad for RSI 

But well have to also avoid  you know  buttons responding to the slightest touch as well 

So I guess were gonna have to figure out what age group were  were targeting 
and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into 

So it m it may be too complicated for us  but its something to keep in mind anyway 

And something that might further complicate it is that the TV makes noise itself 

We need to decide if that is our um intention is  is a simplistic design 

Um an LCD screen though might be something that  you know  you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working 

It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on  and what was next 

Might be quite expensive to do that though 

Um  I think our priority really should be unique design 

so uh in my opinion it should be  um  userfriendly and unique 

Um  I th myself  voice recognition kind of scares me off 

I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds  we could go for the fancy stuff 
But if we wanna make fifty million  and and have everyone want this remote control  we should maybe
stick to the basics 

Um  so I I think  I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more 

Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like  Ive received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions 
Um  for one thing  because Having controls with DVD  VCR  that sort of thing  would really complicate the design of the remote control  Um  weve decided not to include them and make it a specific  just a specific television um function 
Which is good as  as weve sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway 

Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated  because more people are using the internet now 

So  um  all the remote controls must have our um Well incorporate our logo and colour in in some way 

but for the purposes of this meeting I  I wasnt offered a  like a type of logo or colour 

Its probably R RR in yellow 

Um  so  now we need to discuss  um and come to a decision on our remote control functions  of  of how this is going to be 

Are we going to write off the LCD option 

So no LCD  no teletext  and no voice recognition 

I dont use teletext that much  but if it was on your TV  youd want to be able to use it 

It was a management decision 
so its  its pretty much out of our hands at this point 

Um  well I guess  just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons 

I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had 

Would you be able to  um  put the little device anywhere 

so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere  or something 

It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess  but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller 

Would it need a battery then 

So  mm  more research into that one 

um  the glowinthedark  fluorescent  whatever  system  um is a go ahead 

Um right  if w if were minimising buttons  we might be able to make them actually larger 

We could  may  possibly  sorry  incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glowinthedark material 

I just thought that it  it might be sucking more battery power  if there  if it is a light up 

Um  so like big b um buttons  for people you are visually impaired 

I guess the other option  referring to the battery thing is  you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something  when youre s and then it goes 

Um  if instead of a constant light up on the  on the remote control  if it lights up for ten seconds when its touched again 

Thats probably feasible 

Um  did we want to go for the glowinthedark look 
Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly 

Because it might  for  for our design purposes  I mean  the lighting up thing might be better because glowinthedark material has a funny kinda colour 

So weve decided on lighting up things 

it might be perceived as tacky  glowinthedark 

Yeah well  I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control 

So I I dunno if theres something that diff  you know like five different face plates 

and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well 

I think that we should incorporate that 

You could start out with three  and if  if we hit it big then we can add some on 

Um  the environmental factor  we didnt bring that up again 

Well have to do more research
