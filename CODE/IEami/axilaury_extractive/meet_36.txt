So this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting 
And uh opening and uh PMs of the meet minutes 
uh prototype presentation from uh Christine and uh Agnes 

and uh evaluation criteria 
The finance  its uh from my side  from the management 
and uh production evaluation  Then uh closing 
So we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further  okay 

Okay  lets talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype 

Ive done a presentation 
but it pretty much covers work that weve both done 
so if Im missing anything  Christine can just correct me 

from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting  we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape 

so in terms of function  you have to be able to turn the TV on and off  volume and channel control  menu control  voice recognition control 
and weve incorporated the LCD screen on the flip panel as part of the design 
if we figure out its too expensive  well then you just take it off 

This is our remote control  with the flip panel as you can see 
So if you lift up the panel  you can see the lovely yellow LCD display 

The yellow button you have is the on off button 
so its really big  hard to miss 
You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume 

The green are the channel changing 
S And its one of those very light  very touchable displays 
And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom 
and on the righthand side you have the access to the menu on the TV 
and on the lefthand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition 

Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing

the material that we chose was wood 
and uh the colour would be customisable 
cause you can stain the wood whatever colour 

and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front 

We havent um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed 
That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um

I think the microphone is on on the top  uh on the middle  the under the flip 

But it shouldnt be under the flip either 
because you can have the remote control closed  but you still might want to activate it by voice 

my opinion I think its better under the flip
because whenever you want to uh the talk  okay  so then you can speak then you can close it 
But if you put it on the on the flip  okay  then uh technical I dont think its uh feasible 
cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised 

I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and Im too lazy to reach over and pick it up  I can just use my voice 

I mean it doesnt have to be on the flip 
it can be on the side somewhere 

Yeah  the sides maybe is good 

You need to work on the weight a little bit 

And maybe the shape of the buttons 
the little egg shapes arent the most economical  but

Im satisfied 

We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well 

And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they dont like something thats too light 

So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy 

because they dont feel like they have enough control over it 

So thats pretty much it for our presentation actually 

Well  the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that weve weve talked about on the previous meetings 
Now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh

so then lets come to the finance uh 
I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget 
So here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells 
Uh its optional  somewhat optional
and Ed wants the chip on print  thats what uh we were talking about that 

So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker  then uh we have the wood material  then special colour and push button 

actually  our budget was uh twelve point five Euro 
but uh its coming to nine point nine five Euro 
so we are under uh below the budget 

Well we havent come to mine yet  so
were gonna have a bit of difference of opinion  yes 

 Its gonna cost a long way to c you know  cost a lot of money to market it  is it 

on this pr provisionary cost analysis  we do not have a LC display 
LC display is gonna be very expensive 

No we do  but its not filled in 

We dont have the price up there 

youre right  sorry  yes 

okay  so if we add approximately two to three Euro per remote  now were up around about twelve  twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested  Um

So that means we can put the uh the LCD in  yeah 

But as far as production um Im putting up a question
because were talking about profit also 
and in mine youll see uh the problem with uh our survey  the p the possibility that how many units can be sold  what percentage of the market  etcetera etcetera

Uh this is just production cost  it is not uh advertising cost  its not transportation cost uh
And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company 
So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit  were gonna have to go a long ways 

so when it go into the quantity  okay  and the cost will come down 

Although customisation  because this is being done  you know  the on onorder basis  it might be uh the the quantity wont m wont uh

Its gonna be very hard to reduce 

Uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro 

so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors  okay  to get uh the production cost less  okay 
so then we can save some money  okay  to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions  whatever  okay 

I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down 

So now Im gonna scare everybody out of this project 

since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year 

Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million

Which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year 
which is actually a tremendous amount 

if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twentyfive Euro 

with transport  promotion  labour  because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost  transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however were gonna break this down between our our retailers 

At two million units  we have to have a profit of twentyfive Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit 

I just did a run down the evaluation of the form 
the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the of the unit  the ease of use  speech recognition  cost  weve gone through these 
Now  the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production 

but being that the market changes very very quickly  maybe theres no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now 
So  now we have to come up with a decision 
Can the company sell two million units 
Can it sell it for fifty Euros 

Uh uh um I would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel
which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering
and then to dropship the p product to the customers residence 

You can do a shipping centre somewhere 
or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs 

In fact  we should sell through Amazon 

Or eBay  yeah 

That actually makes more sense if were gonna make it so highly customisable 
cause on the web people can look at the different options they have  see maybe what other people have done  what the range of possibility as 

And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di
the only thing that youre missing really is the weight 

The weight and feel 

but people are getting used to buying things online that they cant touch before buying 

maybe theres a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year  which could you know  feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit 

I dont think thats uh not possible 

okay then  l uh lets wait for the production  okay  then uh you can evaluate the product 
so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real 

Well I was just wondering about if were gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad  this is bad  we want this done differently 

We probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and testmarket it 

Mm thatd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea 

So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks 

Think minimum two weeks if were gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use

Okay  so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation  okay 

Lets proceed with this model  okay  for the for the marketing direction  okay 
So no more changes will be made  okay  in this the basic design 

So we will introduce m this model and uh lets introduce in the market
and lets take the feedback from the customers  then we can uh go for the
second generation 

The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we havent thought of 

Well  every customer  okay  they have their own ideas  they have their own test  okay  so theres no end  theres no limit 

No  but theres a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and finetuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we dont really have anything to back it up 

I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need 

well you have no redesign not you personally  but in the project we have no redesign time and

Ed  d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for TV remote control sales 
Would it be the Christmas season by any chance 

The sports time 

Sports season 

Right before the Eur the World Cup  World soccer  World Cup soccer 

So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a usertested device with some special event 

Yeah  thats a good idea 

but  so  Im just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing
pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event

Thats actually good place to advertise it too 

There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on DVD that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it 

Maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage 

A lot of products have gone out there without being properly usertested and completely flopped 
when in fact it gets rereleased a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy 

so  youre right  timing is very important 

Okay  so then uh lets come to the closing
and uh are the costs within the budget
and uh is the product evaluated  okay  so that will uh come soon 
Okay for uh but our time being  so thanks for all your efforts and great work and uh great design

Yes  the that of course uh I will convince the management to do that  okay 

I think he can promote the the brand value and the product value 

and uh lets leave it to the Ed for later for once production is over
