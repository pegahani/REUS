What are y What are your first ideas for the new product 

The project I got was just for a TV remote control 

I was thinking about design remote control  with our uh motto and all 

No rational changes or whatever  cause it revolutionary changes 

so very intuitive design  I guess 

Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh  yeah  to be able to use it as well 

but I think its a little take it into consideration 

is uh the the material it is made of  it should be something light 

Selling price  twenty five Euros 

The production price  twelve and a half Euros  approximately 

Well reach the uh reach that profit 

international 

Anyway  well take this project in three steps  three pha uh three phase of design
