Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group 

Um Ill again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting 
Um the the the problem with existing remote controls  we felt  was that theyre ugly

Um theyve got lots of buttons on them
that uh people dont use

Um and people lose them 

um that were we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons 
and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use 

um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery

and a shape that will be instantly recognisable  A um as uh a trendy remote control  and and B as uh a Real Reaction product 

again um  Ill well have the three three presentations from the the the three of you
and then uh well well make a a final a final uh decision 
Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today  finally  are um what energy source we want to use 

And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if were gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply  then basically its uh sealed for life

um and uh this is where I need uh uh Kates expert advice

um d d do we go for a custom designed chip 
Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves 

we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward
and well well finalise those uh da today 
Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface 

Uh and then uh  you know  f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look  feel and design 
Kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it
and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation 
And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at 

Ill just be talking about the components design 

basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do 
Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command
and then this is translated uh into uh light signals
which are then seen by the TV 
Uh the materials were gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery
and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator  uh two more resistors and a capacitor
and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor  Um 
Uh basically what happens is youll press a number or give a voice command
and this creates a a connection within the the remote

the chip then senses this connection
and produces a signal in a Morse code format 
This signals sent to the transistor

and then sends it on to the light emitting diode

which is then trai changed into a infrared light

as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons 
Uh y the fewer buttons you have  I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes youre gonna need  Um
however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult

Also we have to work within the company constraints 
and the company has informed me via email that uh theyre experts at pushbuttons
and that seems to be the most uh costeffective way of producing it 
Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use 
so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a backup basic battery
and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years

Um we also need to look at the chips  uh v customdesigned versus off the shelf 
and the customdesigned will give us much more flexibility
and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon 
Um  however thats gonna cost more 
but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper

but its going to be less flexible with the features  especially things like uh voice activation 

so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option wed probably have to design um our own chip 

Do we do we know uh by how much 

inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive 

I dont actually have any price information 

And and do we know how long itll take to uh develop a a custom chip 

a lot longer than an off the shelf chip 

I think we need to make a a decision here 
Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply 
that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology 

Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands 
for example if you um can preprogramme in like numbers one through ten

and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one

Once youve got the whole voice chip in there  then its pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit 

given that  you know  mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling 

speak somebodys name and itll dial the number for you 

Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive 

maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost 

I kinda think if were gonna have the voice recognition for part of it  then maybe we should have it for the whole thing 

given that the um the technology is not well developed
and and given that its its never been done before 

uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons 

Anyway  Im Im incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it 

it will have voice recognition um uh

so I did some research on the internet

the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users 
um commands and mechanisms for the operation 
and therere just kind of a variety of choices 
Um findings 

a lot of times they tend to look cluttered
and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual 
Therere some special ones available  like this one right here 
which is marketed towards children  um different designs 
and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V in volume

Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like 

just kind of minimise the clutter 
avoid too many buttons
and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button  like you have on a mouse 
that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume  for example  have the slide button on the side 

I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that theyre theyre si simple  cheap and reliable 

I think theyre theyre about the same cost really 

theres a lot of slide buttons out there 

Okay  fair enough  fine 

for example if Im using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down
so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down

So three three theres three buttons on a slider 

The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons  like the buttons on one side for the channel  and then the slider is that if youre just holding in your hand  and you pick it up  its easy to n s know  okay  this is just the volume and this is the channel 

cause Ive definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume  or vice versa 
so itd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different 

like the shape of it almost like a mouse 

we have to come up with is the the actual shape

so we were looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change

I was thinking kind of just for the volume 

in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling 

this is my report on trend watching 
The datas come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer 
And we got reports from Paris  Milan on new fashions 
And uh the most important aspect is the l the look
it has to look fancy  look and feel
uh instead of the current functional look and feel 

I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect 
which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it 

and the third being easy to use is probably a given 

I think that what were suggesting ought to address all three of those 

from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes  et cetera 

clothes  shoes and furniture
and uh a spongy material to be used on the on the outside 

thats different  certainly 

if were going for the it looks fancy  then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through 
But fashions do dont last very long 

that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things 
like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year
and uh whatever happens next year  we can have the face plates 

we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it

Also means you can drop it without damaging it 

depending on the cost of the product itself  you know  could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed  Instead of having a ten year guarantee 
With interchangeable covers  could just buy a new one every year  a new one when new fashions come out 

its like the old Swatch watch
where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those 
cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion 

What if we included the batteries in the cover 

Oh yeah  I like that 

Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it its its even better 

I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last  you know  a long time 

I I think its easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one 

That all c also kind of encourages em to buy new covers

I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y youve then got the connection

whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all  you know  completely soldered together

um and  you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing 
the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they dont it doesnt have a cover on at all  it will still work um totally 
Um then if  you know  if people lose the cover  I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote 

that thats just it with the covers  youre sort of tricking em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making em feel like theyre being ripped off having to buy a new product 

its its up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item 
Um and  you know  as as external fashions change  then we get new new covers on the market and  you know  readily available 

like they have for mobile phones
that are just fruits and animal prints and colours 

And you know  th the the design that Ive got  and and it could be a a homemade design  um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control 

the fashions apply to furniture 

Its the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me 

I mean given that weve got you know one one on off button presumably  two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else 

um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing 

And  know whether we go down the fruit and veg route 

and I dont suggest we make it look like a banana 
but um know sort of the the organic  you know  curved look 

t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know  the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes
and  you know  whether whether the you know  the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow  Um

cause theres certainly you know  the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed

I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow

yellow seems a bit of a strong colour

I mean were were were simply its simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um 

I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape thats almost like a mouse 

because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand
um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape

but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and

my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape
so that you can just sort of ho hold it 

youd want it narrower than a mouse though
cause it a mouse youre kinda just resting on it 
you want something you can definitely grip 

so its you sorta hold it in your hand like that  i with  you know  and fiddling with the buttons 

kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this 

and then it widens up top

And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light  the infrared light at the TV and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume
and the power could be wherever  up up the top or something 

Um Im just Im suddenly realising that yeah were discussing how much how good its gonna be to change channels

I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it 

I think we d I think we decided that w were actually going down both routes 

we need the the manual controls

were leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff 

but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice 

my personal view is that if its not there  people wouldnt use it anyway um 

you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons 

if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands 
and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness

Im getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available 

We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume 

if we if were going down that route  then we need some sort of display 

But the television would be the display

We actually use the television  okay  Okay  okay  okay 

like you hit menu
and menu will come up on television

so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select 

I think weve actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um 

Kate and Kendra now go away
and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or playdough 

Um and actually put what weve discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete 

Our energy source is gonna be

for simplicity of  you know  manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um 

and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control 

and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh well say at least five five ten years

And interchangeable case 

I i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept 
Um it it should be cheap  you know  if if we avoid any  you know  electrical connections 

i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want  then uh I mean uh uh this is totally new 
We d we dont know whether
that to what extent people do it or not 
but if theyve at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway 

so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets 

And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or

because weve got so few buttons
that it that actually makes that redundant 

no 

cer certainly wider angle than than current 
so that if youre holding it  you know  anyway like youre likely to and uh its uh you know  i i it will work most of the time um 

I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing  then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh 

were all clear where we go from here 

thank you very much indeed
and Ill s see you all again in thirty minutes
