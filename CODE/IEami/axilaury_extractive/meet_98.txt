This is our conceptual design meeting 

Ill just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes 
Um then each of you will have your presentation 
um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control 

Um we decided that  or we know that we need to use company colours  company logo 

our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users 
Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before 

Um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple  Um

And that it should look different than whats out there 

Um uh I think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it 

Um and that we didnt wanna go with a universal remote  because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity 

I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be  Um
Um something that will fit into uh easily into someones hand 

And with a scrolling um function also 

I was given a brief executive summary  and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at 

Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy lookandfeel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional lookandfeel design 

Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative 

And thirdly the remote would be easy to use 

And again these are all things weve kind of already come up with on our own  but this just backs it up 

As far as fashion update  weve learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths  shoes and furniture 

Um and also  as opposed to last year  this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel 

Um I think weve already discovered that its kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design 

But I think that  even if its very subtle  we need to kind of trick our consumers 

We brought up the idea of having two pieces  which we could discuss further 

We need to keep it simple  have limited buttons 

so they at least get the idea that theyre getting something thats new and modern and sleek and

Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables 

So maybe we could have something thats somewhat removable 

I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable 

Or with exterior designs 

Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones 

Personalise your remote 

Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they  the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology  where you can program questions into such devices 
They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question  you program the answer  and the machine responds accordingly 

Theres different ways of a user can use products l like a remote 
Um theres a graphical use  where you you look at pictures and well on a screen 
A command line where you obviously type things in  and you get a response 
Um and then it ju thats just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes 

Um this is the voice  there is a voice recognition remote control  which can control mus multiple devices 

So  then I had a look at new products that are on the market 

And then on the right is obviously an iPod 

and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through 

And nothings simpler really 
Um then theres things like this  which is a a a kids remote 
where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before 

So I dont know if theres a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components 

Maybe weve so suggested this twopart thing  where if it was to have a speech recognition thing 

And then just have the simple sort of handheld thing that we sort of devised earlier  as the actual remote 

it could be a graphical display  the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus 

The details of the components design  as you can see there  what we have is the board  main board of the remote control 

top left side you can see the chip  which is the  what we were talking about  this was is the device to recognise the signals the input 

Its job is to wait for you to press a key  then to translate that key press into infrared light signals  um that are received by the television 

Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time 
We are talking something more complicated of course  its going to be more expensive as well 

Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell  or in the material that we could use for our outer shell 

So we what we can use is plastic  rubber  wood and titanium 
Can also mix these 

Um what we could use is  or what I was offered  or what we could use  is a basic bateer battery 

So um obviously I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really 

Um solar cell is interesting 
May fail though  every here and there 

Um the kinetic energy thing um might work  um but the same problem 
You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work 
So Id say what were stuck with really is um the basic battery 

our interface options are pushbuttons 

however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod Ive one big objection and that is that we have to fit an LCD into the remote control as well 

If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh setup that we that Ive just presented  um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well 

solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control 

With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design 

With plastic  as I understand it  you can use any form 

With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it 
but we cannot add scroll wheels  and we cannot add an LCD screen 

And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit 

Is that an option  a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots 

You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose 

I would say  if I were to make a decision  I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance 

I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous 

How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control 
Say we dont make it p a particular fruit shape obviously 
but uh give it like the surface of
an orange  banana  whatever 

So is the two piece idea out 

Well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery 

Well we can still design a twopiece uh remote um without having a base  having one of them be a base station 

Okay when it comes to the chiponprint  as I said  the the more advanced features you want  um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive 

Energy source I think weve  I think weve decided batteries  although not exciting  are probably our best bet 

So I guess the case would be plastic 
with Perhaps thats not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it 
Its more of a su its more of a supplement maybe 

So then for the scroll  are we going for the iPod type 

Yeah I think so 

Which will require a more expensive chiponprint right 

Um Ryan youll be working on the user interface design  Um
Manuel youll be working on the lookandfeel design 
Corrine well want a product evaluation 
And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh
maybe and and get us a prototype 

basically just be working on the prototype  uh well accomplish your other two actions
