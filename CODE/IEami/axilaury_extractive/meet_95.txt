Um the agenda for this meeting is um well initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers 
And then we will evaluate it  given the criteria that um that we gave gave it 
And um talk about our finances  whether we were under or over our budget 

Its a pretty simple design 
Its um based on a mango 

And we have the company logo here

wheres the LED 

Its in the middle of one of the little Rs 
And then the other one is the power 

So its palmheld 

buttons are accessible from your thumb 

And this is just if youve got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus 

So one plus one would be eleven 

You press a plus button 

Ive never heard of that kind before 

but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five  channel sixty five  if I press the six itll go to channel six  and then Ill press the plus  and then itll go to six and then put the five and itll go to sixty five 

we can further define that 
I wouldnt have thought itd be a problem that it went to channel six first  in like on the way to channel sixty five 

like as long as we realise thats what itll do 

Well the there is a theres a delay on remotes I think 

um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers
because we thought thats kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb 

And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well 

Um and the feel of it  I mean  weve made this out of Play Doh  which is representing the  you know  the rubber  and the spongy rubberness 

Okay  as for the colours  we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype 

that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use 
Um and were thinking to carryon with the fruit and vegetable theme  the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit 

But were thinking that  seeing as were having it in interchangeable casing anyway 

like banana could be black and yellow  watermelon red and green 

Bananas more representative of our colour scheme  like the company the yellow and black 

or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in

we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device 

And so now that weve we have a prototype  uh we need to go over the finances

Do you need to do a presentation first 

Evaluation criteria is next in line 

Um  were gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that weve just seen 
Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings  um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were 

Um and were gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false 
So basically the lower p the lower the points the better 

Do we have a fancy lookandfeel 

Weve been quite successful with the rubber coating

The look is a little bit more playful 

Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy 

I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype arent the colours that I think we wouldve necessarily chosen 

I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy 

I kinda I like the potato look 

Its a two 

Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative 
So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative 

and the use of the rubber 

and we dont have any scroll buttons  its all pushbuttons 
theres no LCD control 
so if were thinking about the rest of the market  its sort of probably halfway 

we didnt want it to be any more innovative than this  because then that wouldve defeated the purpose 

well put three 
but I think we actually reached our goal 

Uh  will it be easy to use 

Yeah  One 

you cant really get confused with that 

The plus number thing 

But once thats figured out  it should be fine 

Is this a goodlooking remote 

Again I think the colour comes into this 

I think that the logo could be smaller 

Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent 

I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand 

wheres it gonna sit in your living room 

the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit 

But then it wouldnt sit as comfortably in your hand 

Would we wanna show it off to our friends 

Okay  so should we say two for that 

will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product 

I think we have to market it in the right way  that um to say that it is simplistic 

And the kinetic energy part 

No  I guess  I dont know much about the remote control industry  how much your average sells for 

About ten pounds 

But you dont have to buy batteries 
So in the long term this can actually save you money 

I would give it a two still though 

Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user 

I think it does very well 

easy to use 

Okay so one 

Will this remote control be easy to find when lost 

is the alarm system still was it implemented 

But I mean its not obviously obvious from the outside that thats gonna happen cause you cant s particularly see an alarm 

I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up 

You press the button it makes a noise

It would just be a little speaker on the back or something 

We can give it a one 
because compared to every other remote ever m ever made  this one will be easier to find 

Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new 

its eas theyll pick it up and theyll know what to do 
The plus thing needs to be worked on 

well say yes its uh one 

Uh  will it minimise the effects of RSI 

I think so 

We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we dont know about 

Two okay 

Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo 

Well  yeah the colours are yellow and grey 
So it could be grey on the banana one 

I think this is the
the factor that weve been least successful in confronting 

Four I think 

Um  did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics 

But maybe more like two

Alright so based on this evaluation  do we average them out sorta thing 

Yeah it is one point nine 

So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing 

Um were using a regular chip 

Um  its cur its double curved  so its curved all around 

Um  were using plastic and rubber 

So its like special colour well well have two colours

Well one colour for the case  one colour for the buttons 

So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros 

I mean we werent really given a lot of time  or materials  yeah  to go about our design task 

Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess  but m

and like if we had decided to use the LCD screen  and like solar power backup and everything  then we wouldnt have been able to afford that 

Good leadership  I think we stayed on task 

and also our personal coach helped us along the way 

We never were pushed for time  or sat around doing nothing  so

I think we worked great as a team 

We needed more Play Doh colours 

The computer programmes are good 

Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other 

Fantastic 

Thank you very much
