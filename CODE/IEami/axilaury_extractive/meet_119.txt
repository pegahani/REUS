So these are the um last notes we I made 

F Youre going to show your pr prototype presentation after me 

If anything doesnt look right  just say it to me then 

Are we doing the the speech recognition 

Okay  but its still possible uh uh financially 

Okay yeah  Well then then were gonna put it in 

Or are we making a slide open  like underneath 

Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls 

Its may maybe uh a bit stronger as well 

Yeah  were gonna use the advanced chip then 

No  you have a different chip for speech recognition  So
So I already calculated that and its still in the budget 

Yeah  we just made a Word file with the basic elements 

Simply a square with uh round corners 

Uh the material should be hard plastic 
Uh colour changeable  and also transparent 

The functions are just basic 

Mute function  onoff function  text functions 

And the logo is over here  and the mic 

So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone 
Yeah  speech recognition 

Um I didnt have a specification of that  But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something 

Only one button to say its on or off 

Yes  you need options to configure it  and after that you dont need em anymore 

Well we havent had time to design that  the slide pad 

I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something  So

Um onoff buttons  text buttons  mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are  easy to find 
Um the onoff button is a bit bigger  uh so it stands out 

Its basically the be standard place for scrollwheel  as far as I know 

Its uh twelve buttons 

F the form well  weve taken that from the iPod  other popular technical device 

Um well use hard plastic  Since that allows us to use uh two D buttons  uh nonrubber buttons 

We have decided uh in the the channel buttons  theres a little uh colour around it 
And also in the numpads  theres also colour light behind it 

Okay  maybe we use this button for the

Okay  there is one uh function I use uh daily  and its not on the basic functions 
Its uh to switch to uh uh your Scart 

Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something 

And h how does the second level come out 
Uh it slides uh along 

Right  the video channel  Play Station  etcetera  Thats used pretty often 

So here are multiple speech buttons 
I dont know how many 

Uh menu buttons with arrows 

Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs 

Colour buttons 

Yeah  maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel  that it is volume 

Theres one text button I prefer 
Thats the one uh that you use if you search for a page  uh like seven hundred  uh and its counting from one hundred to two hundred  you will switch to your television and back to text 

If you if you turn teletext on  you you set the seven hundred  and you turn it off  then the next time you turn it on  it still stays on seven hundred 

Thats a functionality for the television 

uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred  page seven hundred to the television  Th th th if you switch it on 

And maybe we can write the numbers below or above 

Because um if you use it a couple of years  some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away 

Uh the buttons  Uh from which material are they now 

I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons 

Yeah  I made some criteria uh  so we can uh ev evaluate our model 

and we have to test the criteria from one to zero 
We sh we we we can give it uh a number  and then we can give ourself an average for our

And um we have to discuss about  if we give it a one or a seven 

If its really uh  if you can if you can get the iPod look  then its beautiful  I think 

The basic colours are black or green or yellow 

Maybe um company colours 

A bit a bit of yellow 

Yeah  grey  Just dark grey I think 

Changeable fronts  so ev for everyone for everyone its something beautiful 

Okay  just give it a two 

The fancy lookandfeel 

And we can change the colours  so thats uh really fancy I think 

Its pretty cool  If you slide it open  it lights up 

And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons  but behind the buttons 

I think its one 

Learnable  Easy to use 

Uh its its very easy to use  but uh the second layer is not easy to use 

And you on dont have to pay attention to that second layer 

Because because I think I think the scroll wheel  uh its very handy  but the first time you get this thing in your hands  its not to use the scroll wheel 

Then a two 

New features  Techno technological innovative 

And the scrollwheel  backlights  slide 

The speech function is new 

and the slide  Uh I think the slide is pretty new 

But then we also have the the home station 
We are forgetting about that now  but

Yeah  we didnt draw that too  but

Okay  And new features  so we give it a two or also again a one 

No  just so its still a two 

Yeah  but did we reach  um with our uh style  the targeted audience 

You get the fancy things for younger people  And you get the the aesthetic things for older people 

But we didnt follow the latest trends 

Yeah  you could make a a front

Like a a f banana kind of front 

So we give ourself a three or something 

Yeah  it is one point eight three 

A perfect score 

Okay  lets have a look at this one here  the production cost of it 

Yeah  there are some that they didnt mention  because recharge is not on the list 

So I think we are pretty much in the right direction  because its twelve point three Euros 

But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or
Can we make that for uh h twenty cents 

The b the button supplements  I didnt I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was

But this is expensive  the sample speaker 

Is that uh included  In the twelve Euro or

Its kind of weird that we we get this information now  afterwards 

So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together 

Was there room for creativity 

Mm uh i Yeah  I think so 

Yeah m If we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity

I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it  So

Okay  so the leadership

Just normal discussion  I think  Not
one leader or something 

Uh team work

the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard 
We were not all We were not um agree with every not agree with 

Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time 
I think that was the m biggest problem 
Like uh the prices 
If we knew that before  we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker 

But the teamwork was okay 

Yeah  uh everybody could speak their uh opinion 

I think uh everyone listen to each other 

The smart board is okay 
Digital pen is horrible 

But if you want to download it to your computer  its doesnt work 

Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with  if it worked really well 

Yeah  i if if it would be faster  it would be great 

Yeah  the drawings are are hard to make  I think 

Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style 
But you might as well do it in normal computer style 

So we made it in time 
And we made a remote control 

In the budget  yeah 

New ideas found 

I dont know what it mean 

To gather  or to uh work together  uh or new ideas for

Yeah  but still  you couldnt make a fancy a f you couldnt make a a prototype out of this  Because we dont have any sizes and
Yeah  but it You cant possibly do that in such a short time  I think 

Yeah  this this is just the idea phase 

I think just I just write a final report 

Guys  I think we have to finish the meeting 

Fill in the questionnaire
