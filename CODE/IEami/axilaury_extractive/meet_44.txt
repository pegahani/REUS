Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting 
Um were gonna discuss the look and feel design  the user interface design  and were gonna evaluate the product 
And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control 

um and then Im gonna have to specify the final design in the final report 

we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no LCD display  no need for talkback 
it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons 
maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal LEDs to shine through the casing 
um hopefully a jogdial 
and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well 

Um  there are a few changes weve made 
Um  well look at the expense sheet  and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside 

this is gonna be an LCD screen  um just a a very very basic one 
very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm

Uh  apart from that  its just pretty much the same as we discussed last time 

the advanced functions are still hidden from you  but theyre hidden in the sense that um theyre not in use 
Um theyre in the LCD panel and the jogdial 

The LCD panel just displays um functionally what youre doing 
If youre using an advanced function right  like um c brightness  contrast  whatever  it will just say

It might even be one  a bit more complex LCD panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the  you know  the the symbols of the various functions 
Thats a number pad 

Where are we gonna have the slogan 

just like right inside there 
Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger
so we reckon maybe thatll be about the same size as the palm of your hand 

So were talking about ten centimetres 

Were gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button 

uh Im just gonna bring up the idea of colours 

this button um  because its red its sort of very prominent  were gonna use it as uh it can be the power button
if you hold it for maybe two seconds itll send a standby signal 
Um apart from that its gonna be used as a confirm button for the LCD screen

Oh weve discussed how h high it is  but how wide is it 

be about th three and a half 

what else can you do 

Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons 

but um because weve got the the LCD and the jogdial we just thought wed um use that as the volume 

And what else do you do with the jogdial 

Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast  colour and

Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them 
Audio  we have like your basic y your base  your midrange  your high range 

leftright balance 
um maybe even preprogrammed sound modes 

We can now have a little look at the the Excel sheet and price listing 
and see if we need to
um if we need to rethink anything at all 

for this first part here powerwise  have we got battery 
Do we have kinetic as well 

No 

And thats because of cost restraints is it 

Yep 

We need an advanced chip I think  yep 

So we want doublecurved 

I think were gonna have to skip the rubber 

um and we wanted special colours didnt we 

For the case itself  one colour  Its one special colour 

Weve got push buttons as well 

So were w w quite far over 

Okay lets just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one 

somethings gonna have to go 
Um were at sixteen point eight and

The other thing could be that um you could take away the LCD panel and the advanced chip together 

so when we scroll we need just some way to get the TV to respond 

It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone  underneath theres actually one button underneath  its just that the panel itself is a single panel 

or the colours  you could take away s colours for th for the buttons 

No can do 

Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons 

And now were under budget 

sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat 

widthwise were looking at about what three centimetres or something 

How how tall do you envisage it being 

About two centimetres  okay 

Maybe closer to three even or two and a half 

Okay well s well say two point five 

but um just in in that we want this to be stylish  should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid 

I think thats something thats very hard to catch 
so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something 

What about button shape 
Square buttons 

A Yeah

Maybe we should do the design evaluation first 

discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points 

Ive reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning 
and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan 

So to sort of b bring together two things  sort of design goals and also the market research that we had 
uh when we rate this  one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low 

and um weve been asked to uh to collectively rate this 

So the first one uh  stylish look and feel 

I rate that pretty highly 

Okay lets go with five then 
Fi oh uh just actually the opposite 

Lets go with two point five then 

high tech innovation 

so weve had to remove a few of our features we wanted 
but jogdial

Yeah about three  okay 

Style reflects a fruit inspired colour  design 

the the yellow is more representative of the colour 

Okay  the blue the blue colours and dont re dont actually represent the colour 

so well go two 

and um design is simple to use  simple in features 

I mean Id give that nearly a one 

Um  soft and spongy  have we achieved that 
Weve used mostly plastic in the end so its going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price 

Yeah I think its about five 

logo  weve got it in there  havent we 

And um its within budget  yep 

out of forty nine with with zero being the highest 

We are at uh two  seven  eight  ten  fifteen point five 
So its pretty good 

I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design  revisiting our original goals 

Its not something I need to p push through 
but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions  um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um

uh well next up then  because weve done finance  is the project evaluation 

Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and

Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing 

Yeah  yeah

it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave  and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then  you know 

But I dont I dont think it means the room as in this room 

answering the question uh in those terms Id say that actually theres sort of a tease of creativity

Were told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology  but build something for twelve and a half pounds 
so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual

The constraints do come in very fast 

its um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right  gotta cut everything out cause we dont have enough money 

I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings 

and I think the fact that were wearing these things restricts

it it it does actually you know affect how  w whether you feel comfortable to communicate 

and and the time the time given also restricts

In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within 
And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member  so
But its not bad leadership  its just sort of s fairly strong  you know 

I think the interactions are very structured 

So you think maybe a little too controlling or

Yeah  oh yeah  without without a doubt 

I dont think theres a sense of control cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a  like a consensus right  we go around and we think about it 

Uh  reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting 

uh what about teamwork 

If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them  that wouldve been a lot easier 

I think the tools that they were given  the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they dont support collaboration  I think thats the word 

I mean sort of taking upon that idea  w the way I see this i is that its uh the the s the structure in which weve weve approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork
because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided  and then the work went on in isolation

I think the whiteboard  for me  is the kind of thing I would use all the time 

maybe just in the way that we we use it  in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings  that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text 

I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype
and its completely you know um abs abstract from the final product  but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss

and in a way everybodys as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks 

were actually just each of us discussing something thats in each of our own minds 

I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard 
and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think 

And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints  I dont think  you know  we needed to actually it could have  we could have gone through it verbally 

What about the digital pens  did you find them easy enough to use 

Oh theyre a bit clunky 

Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well 

But I think the pen is v is very intuitive 

So I think the pens good 

And o on the topic of the technology  it just occurred to me that we actually didnt need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files 

We only actually needed one computer 

And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something  you know 

 the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other 

well you know its kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when youre told you must now work away from your team 

I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on

I really thi i I think maybe if wed like all been working in the one room 
and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c

And we have Ninja Homer 

Well apparently now I write the final report 

Im slightly gutted that we couldnt get plastic and rubber 

Oh  I did learn something new  PlayDoh is useful 

It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing  in being creative 

Like we were playing with the PlayDoh and the ideas came with the PlayDoh rather than with everything else 

It becomes tangible
