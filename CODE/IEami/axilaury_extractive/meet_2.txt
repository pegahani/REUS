I will uh present here agenda with with with with slides to you 

first uh just to mention I will take notes uh of this meeting

Ive also made notes of the previous meeting
and um I was about to send them you
but then uh I had to go to this uh meeting

So y you are the secretary also 

Yes  Indeed 
Then I hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting 
Um  W We will uh in a minute we will uh start with them 

Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements

I try to work them out 
they were quite abstract 
and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it  Uh Um about the functions

in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group and the functionality of the

You mean the social target group who we wants to target 

Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this 

And then uh we will close this meeting uh
and after this meeting well uh well have a lunch 

uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations 

I c I can talk about it
but I have no slides or anything 

Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it
or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um 

Ive just been um presented with some research weve done in a small focus group

a hundred people  just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control  Um 

Ive just got a web page with some data on it 
Um basically its saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls 
Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly  Um 
Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy 
Um  Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user 
Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot 

Uh  Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons 
so theyve got a remote control with a lot of functionality
but really most of the time they only use a small part of that 

Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said 

I have an a web page yes 

mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh  Uh about this 

theres a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control 
Um  power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour 
Um  channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um
and then theres things like channel settings  audio settings  which are only used very infrequently 
Um  Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour 
so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used  Um 
An interesting thing that this report has brought up
is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room 
so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users  Um 
Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control 
they want something thats easier to use straight away  more intuitive perhaps 

Um  And thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for RSI 
I dont know how wed go about combating that 

Um and then its got a demographic breakdown

Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the

Uh I should be able to actually  if I email it to you now 

these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design 

and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important 

Um  one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control 
And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful 

it would be all based on speech 

Interesting idea 

I think that would not work so well 
You wanna have both options 

it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost 
I mean when it has speech recognition then uh i then it doesnt matter where it is  my well its we should be in range 
or maybe it can respond and produce sound  so say where it is 

Im not sure whether we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents 

And we dont know where the state of the art of speech recognition is 

there is uh its a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on  off  one  two  twenty three 

But its quite noisy if there is the TV uh shouting 

This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control  who would pay more for it  um 
Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more 

seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five 
thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five 
um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five
and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five 

it really depends where were gonna be targeting this product  um 
which well be talking about later I think 

Another thing its talking about there is the LCD screen
but theres no figures apparently on that 

I think as everybody knows uh Im the uh Industrial Designer 
And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control 
Um Id like first to give a quick a very simple introduction  how does it work 

the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed 

an energy source feeds an integrated circuit  the chip 
that can compose messages  usually uh through a um infrared bit
and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages 

the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product 
I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesnt work 

as its important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna

we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control
and I show you the the working design 

Uh we want an on off button 

its simple
but its its important  and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after 

the components I quickly draw here 

in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver

my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control

of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver 

what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this uh schema

And uh thats it so I wont go into details about that
but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components 

And and why do you want these kind of component 
I mean  are they cheap 
or are they uh reliable 

and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if its expensive 

this one also really uh reliable

thats it for the working design 

What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver 

can you can you get back to it 

the receiver is of course already in the television

So we we must adapt to the to the receiver 
I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh 

We will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared

and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists

but we what we can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles 

its just you had to change the frequencies 

But you should be careful 

like a guy has recently designed a remote
uh uh uh which could switch off any other TVs  so basically through all the things 

we should take that into account

I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things 

Im going to talk a little bit about the technical function
so wha what actually its about what is the user going to do 

basically the idea is to send a message to the TV set 

and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons

and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the TV

as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you dont need to k press the keys 
people are can have a speech recognition
but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later 

there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household 

you have a standard TV remote
where you have just a on  off button and play  uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option 
And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine 
but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows 

this is the standard one with without any fancy thing

like i it doesnt have teletext option 

And then you have uh whats the v video remote file

usually it has almost all the keys over there

but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those

personal preferences
I would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing
where the we could have both the uh the f a TV and the remote video remote control
because uh some of the keys in the videos remote control and the TV they could be integrated together

How would that work 

so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the TV or use the VCR 

you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing

in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the VCR option

in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box

suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you
when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program 

In that case you want to browse faster  browse slow  you want to have those kind of functionalities 

These are kind of next generation functionalities 

I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I Ive seen them in the shop 

and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard TV thing 

But I dont think were trying to make a universal remote here 

W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this 

for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand  video overdemand or what we call it as  its presently booming up actually

you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies  and then you select those list 

I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager

first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions
but its its getting used less and less 
Thats thats especially because of the internet of course 

Do we include it  and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh on the remote mot control itself 

further yes we must think  uh do we stay uh to to television only  the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you cant go back

or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices 

Um  furthermore  uh  w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers
and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty 
and our our current customers are mainly forty plus

younger people like trendy trendy designs 
so thats w we should make our our our RC as trendy as possible
but it should also be uh have a reliable image 

right now if you take it you have like zero  one  two  three like a keys separately 
but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys
you press on the top  it takes one number 
you press on the bottom it takes another number 

so that you dont see two separate keys there actually

Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh

Mm  But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting  especially if were going after a younger market 
thats the the the mm the new and the funky things 

for example you have uh presently uh keys like one  two  three like this  actually  and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like uh keys like that

theres lot theres lots of pretty mobile phones 

Cause we havent talked about demographic at all

How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way 

you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so 

so we basically dont change the uh original order of them

so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered

Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group 

Um  basically were trying to get people to buy a remote control
wouldnt they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one 

So our our our remote control has to be better 

cause its only a low market  its a cheapend remote control 

we might well be able to beat them on th the look of it  th the design of it

theyre not just going to buy a new remote control just cause it looks pretty 
they have to actually need it as well 

I think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh uh the appearance of the uh RC is is important when they are buying one

Mm  But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality theyll buy a universal remote 
Ive got friends whove got so many things they need a universal remote 

So your you think we should go for a more u universal highperformance

We Were not building a universal remote 
were not building a high end product 

we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R s RC

now you know that chips are very uh cheaps
and uh we can include it in our control some new new features 

If were getting into universal remote territory  were getting to LCD screens and things like that

we cant  with the price range 

I dont know  I dont know whether thats necessary 

because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive 
S so we can try to go in between 
and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as complicated

because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal 

But if were going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own TVs to use a remote control on 

but w were targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group 
People yes  Who just have or already have a job and have the money but may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control 

I dont know really what the the price range for remote controls is 
Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range 

uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money 

Well Well I its fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive 

because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million

then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control 

And uh basically you can look to the standards of other

And if we want to get the market  we really need that 

I guess what Id like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices  being able to switch between them  there may be stereo  VCR and TV 
And just be able to s use them all from the same remote  but not at the same time 

you can also browse through all the standards you know  where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them 

so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all 

uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need
and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content
and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market 

and well Im sure well up something good

we uh we can have lunch now 

after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work
and then we have the next meeting 
But you will be informed via the computer
