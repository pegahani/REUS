Ill just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting 

decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five 
and we decided that it was gonna be nonrechargeable batterypowered 
that were gonna group our audiovisual and other functions into into those categories  um 
And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext  ignoring everything except the TV  and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan 

Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product 

Uh basically what I wanna do here  before we get into it uh too far  is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful 

Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general  um consumers in general  the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control  a fancy look and feel  okay 
and not  it specified  not a functional look or or feel  uh b f f fancy 

Number two was that it be innovative 

Uh and third priority uh for ease of use 

is that I think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel  and not so much to the functionality of it 

Uh top European fashion trend um that I read about says theres this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables  okay 
especially in clothes and furniture 

So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend 

And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy
and sort of  you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle 

And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um

softness in materials  shape  and function 

so Im thinking if we imagine that were taking some of the features of a Mac iPod
and were then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of

we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all 

uh sorta like a marketing identity 

Like um the ones the ones which Im most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that 

Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something
or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like
covers or something so 

Um theres a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there 
um so Ive taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um

were looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons 
um the shape of the control 
and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control 
Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them 
Um theyre not very attractive to look at 
and theyre not very comfortable to hold 

and theyre very easily lost 

Um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme 
Um for instance  the standby button isnt always red 

The buttons should be large 

They should be easy to press  very comfortable 

so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button  thats kinda confusing 
Um should avoid s things like that 
Um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere 

I think its yellow

any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden 

Um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative 

Um we should definitely avoid the big square block look 

and theyve said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question 
So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take

Um I dont know where the slogan should go 
or really what the slogan is 
I think its um  fashion into electronics 
And we dont know how flexible the colour scheme is 

Um like you said time to market was a problem 
um and how many components are physically in there in cost 
And the power is basically a factor of that 
Um and the lower components  the power  the logic  the transmitter  and the infrared  um they affect you in terms of the size of your device 

So I guess three things  um cost  um complexity  and the size 

um Im not very sure about the voice thing cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are 
Um it said it could talk to you  but it never said anything about being able to listen 
I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that 

Okay so your basic components are buttons 
okay and you have a wheel available  like a mouse scroll wheel 
okay theres an LCD display 

Okay um then theres um how the case actually looks 
It can actually be flat or it can be curved 
um and then the different types of materials that you can use 
um I dont think you can use them in a combination 

Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine 
but plastic  rubber  and wood 

Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use 
but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing 

but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one 

Um and the other components are logic chips  um again Ill Ill go back to the component chips 
The com how complex or how easy the logic is  it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit

Um I dont think the logic chip has a issue about size cause they should be about the same size 
Power consumption should be about the same 

um and the other thing is um the power options 
Um the first one is a standard battery 
Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing 
its a windup you know  a crank 
I think thats more of a look and feel decision because I dont think you can have one power source if youre using the alternative power sources 

I think whatever it is you still need a battery

Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell 

Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one

you have you had those balls  you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes 
you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber 

I guess thats more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable
not so small you cant  you know like a phone or something  too small phone 

um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit 
Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so 

The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features  like the buttons are standard okay  the LCD panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic 
Um the case okay with a rubber case you cant have the solar panels 

titanium case cant be curved  it has to be square 
Okay um theres no restriction on the plastic  and

on the wood 

Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light 

Um I think we could because the LCD panel requires power 
and the LCD is a form of a light

Well m Im thinking along the lines of youre youre in the dark watching a DVD and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this 

and uh y you just touch it  or you just pick it up  and it lights up or something 

Like a phone yeah  like the backlight in a phone 

Were gonna need to put in a really good battery so people dont have to charge their r remote control every few days 

Um thats why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch  like an automatic watch

But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller 

um its probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it 

Um I think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape 
Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit 
Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably  sort of feels right in your hand 

So something quite curvy 

Um and when the corporate colour is yellow 
I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow

about how if you have a bright colour youll not lose it so much 

So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion  then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize 
Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour 

Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones 
and theyre plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside 
and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch 
It feels a bit more comfortable 
and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber
into it 

Id quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape 
Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand  and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need 

So I reckon itd look quite nice if we just had um this here  had a sorta background yellow 
and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons 

also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an LCD display  where would we put that 

The fact that it talks to you  I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says  what is it  putting fashion into electronics or something 

I think thatd probably scare me 

Would we put that on the inside or

Do we need an LCD display 

Its bound to increase the cost of it a lot  I wouldve thought 

what would we what would we achieve from it 

And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings 
So as you scroll through  cause we said we might have a jog dial  so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is 

I think that will be a problem because we dont have an input device to get the listings into it 

I would say no need for a talkback 

um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman  body of the snowman  inside of the snowman 

Um well I think the advanced ones the the ones you dont usually use could be hid inside 

Where would you physically position the buttons 

Um energy what do you think thats suggesting were how were powering the thing 
I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where youd have the backup of the battery  but have have kinetic power 

And this size here  Id suggest this be small  like quite small 

I know were gonna have like rubber buttons

um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being lowtech  rubber buttons plastic frame 
its almost like were reproducing the same old remote control thats out there 

Okay so so backlighting  that would be good 

Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable 

S so like cur slightly transparent case  so its yellow  like tinted yellow  but you can maybe see through it 

Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse 

but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow  doesnt make it freaky 

Um and then the other thing that we were s weve committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity 
and so Im thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled 
cause thats the main thing people will f wanna do 
Could we use like a jog dial  like a nice just sort of round  somewhere on it where you just roll it 

The question is when youre rolling it  how do you wanna roll it 

Cause in a mouse your hands in a position to roll it 
whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way  it tends to get moved accidentally 

Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot 
Um it might work for volume 

and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that 

but not for channels right 

And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing 

and that weve got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side 

That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether youre left handed or youre right handed you might be locking yourself in 

the next meetings gonna be in thirty minutes 

uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Playdoh on that 

Yeah I think the jog dial 

what if it was flat and you just spun it 

a slide  because then you you dont have to put the hand 

and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons  cause thatd just be so standard 

and also t plastic Ive seen can get really textured  so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand 

Feel like fruit
