Its the conceptual design meeting 
And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components  Uh conceptual specification of design  And also trendwatching 

Um but first Ill show you the agenda 
Uh first the opening 
Then we have three presentations 
Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts 

Then a little uh thing about the last meeting 
Uh these are the points um we agreed on  The requirements and the target market 
Uh requirements are uh teletext  docking station  audio signal  small screen  with some extras that uh button information 
And we are going to use default materials 

And were going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers 

um I suggest lets get started with the presentations 

Im uh gonna inform you about the trendwatching Ive done over the past few days 
Um weve done some market research 
We distributed some more enquetes  questionnaires 
And um besides that um I deployed some trendwatchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends 

Um most important thing is the fancy design 
Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor 
Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design 
By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls 
Um about half of  half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use 
Um for our um group  were focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old  this is um  these factors are slightly more equal 

Uh the older people prefer dark colours 
Uh they like recognisable shapes  and familiar material 
And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people 

Um this leads us to some personal preferences 
Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room 
Um so this would mean no uh eyecatching designs 
Just keep it simple

the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest 
because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control 

Um well the trendwatchers I consulted advised that it b should be  the remote control and the docking station should be telephoneshaped 
So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station 

This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people 
So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station 

Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions  one with a woodlike colour and maybe feel  and one with a greyblack colour 
The woodlike for the more uh exclusive people  People with more money 

uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface 
Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons 

thats w what I what I want to uh uh to do in uh our design 

just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions 

finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control  Um the uh I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition 

only uh buttons uh for uh sound  um for uh onoff  um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down 

we uh need some uh new a attractive functions

its uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles 

overall um userfriendly 

using uh large large buttons  Um
Its uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition 
Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control  you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal 

And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something  you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off

Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh  Um

I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles 
um just one button to keep it uh simple 
Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles 
Um double push push um  if double click  um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles  for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who cant uh read small uh subtitles 

weve got um the buttons we have to use  The onoff  sound onoff  sound higher or lower  um the numbers  uh zero to uh uh nine  Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel 
Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons 
And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on 

made a little uh picture of uh it 

Just um we can put uh the onoff button uh over in this uh corner 

D display uh of it  its uh just a small display 
Uh um you can put it uh on top 

and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel  um its uh on place where um the thumb of of the

About the components design 
Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery
or  a as an optional thing  a kinetic energy  like in a watch 

But if we choose for that option  the docking station would c become obsolete 
So I dont think its really an option 
Uh for the casing  uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing  single or double curved casing 
Its really up the the design that were gonna use 

Uh as a case supplement  we could um  I thought of that l later  uh a rubber uh belt  like a antislip 
Uh for the b buttons  we can use plastic or rubber 
And the chipset  um it says simple here 
but it should be advanced 
because were using an LCD uh screen 
And as uh the trendwatcher presentation showed  um people like wood 
but it raises the price
and it doesnt really fit the image  unless we would start two product lines 

Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy 
But depends on what we want 

Um for the case  uh the supplement and the buttons  it really depends on the designer 

that brings us to the discussion about our concepts 

Um first I think we can talk about the energy source 

uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget  I think 

We could use the basic normal battery 
Uh a hand dynamo 

there there are four options 

But I dont think thats really an option 

Uh solar cells 
But not every room is very light

Or the kinetic energy 

And how exactly does the kinetic energy work 

y you basically shake your remote  and then it powers up 

personally I dont think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it 
And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete 
And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um
get great popularity for our product 

you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there 

Uh its uh just a small display
so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more 

I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place 
And I dont think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms 
So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place 
And also what you said  Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote 
But I think its um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station 
So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push  and then it starts beeping 
And then we can we can still use the voice recognition  but maybe then for only the the channels 

Im wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price 

Mm I dont have any information on pricing 

Um we also um asked if w they would  if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control 

you can see here  our target group would not do that 

I would greatly advise not to do it 

So if that would increase the price for which were selling our remote control

But that would also go for the LCD screen then I guess 
Its a bit higher percentage 

here the question was  would you prefer it 

And on top of that the LCD screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use 
And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use 

I personally think the LCD screen we wanna use  with the extra information  I think nobody has anything against it 
Because its just uh some extra information 

Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition 

If we dont have the voice recognition  it will it wont use a lot of energy to use  Um

in that case we could use kinetic uh energy 
but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good 
And much cheaper as well 

And thats the best choice 

let me just choose for the battery 
That brings us to the chip 

there isnt any choice there
because were using the the the the display 
So its gotta be advanced 

And then we get to the point of the case 

Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey  Or both 

wood is a lot more expensive to produce 
Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive 

And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour 

But with colour was a lot more expensive  Or 

Ill have to uh research 

Its a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape 

with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones  uh when you can change the case of it 

Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case 

you have just to make one um standard um remote control 

I think thats a very good option 

You can sell the cases 

and then you can make them with colour  Black and grey  other colours as well 

We would have to look carefully into the design though 

Costs 

I think w we should just  we should then just design one um
one remote 
but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one 

everybodys okay with the changing covers 
I think thats a good uh good option 

Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat  single and double curved 

the the general like most older remotes are flat  just straight 

And what would single curved and double curved mean 

Um it would just only affect the form  for as far as I know 

Its has to be possible to stand up 
Or just only to lie down 

just to lie down 

the interface  What type of interface do we want to use 

Uh we can just use the regular form of it 

Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side 
so you could  so your thumb would be easily

Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side 
For lefthanded users also 

Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up  And on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting  uh for for the sound 

but Im not sure if that would be very good for the easy  ease of use 

Cant we make uh Cant we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same

No thats not gonna work  I guess 

But is it a problem that lefthanded persons use a different hand 
I think the functions are
that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel

I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape 

Lets look at the flat case 

The the single curved so Im not really sure what theyre gonna look like  but I think its something like this 

or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit 

this type should be better for you

I suggest um the single curved 
because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in 

the remote control have to um lay in your hand 

Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand 

And to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh

But I think its better to put the screen uh on top 

And Id prefer the corners to be round 

But um the onoff button  um still on the top uh

Then Weve got a general idea of the concepts and the materials were going to use 

for the next meeting uh well have to look at the lookandfeel design 
Its important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote 
So check out the corporate website maybe 
The user interface design  its the same story 
And product evaluation 
So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one 
But youre going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach 

just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder 

Im not sure if youre going to start right away to work together

I think youre going to fill in the questionnaires first 
And then youll get a message 

Then we can save this one in the folders group 

if you wanna have a look at it  its over there in the projects folder
