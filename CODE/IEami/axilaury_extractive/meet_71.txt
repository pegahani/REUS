here we have our detailed design meeting
where we will um look at the prototype

I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my

It means Im supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting 

um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting 

basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer  uh or from Nathan  and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here

and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition 
IE that had a vaguely nonremote like shape
um because you didnt really need to use it as a remote
since you could just use your voice 
That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation
but with a slide or a foldout bay for more advanced functions for users 

the UID and the ID were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at 

we have assembled our prototype  um 

Um  we took into account a lot of the things
that we went over in the last meeting  um 
Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen

and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions  um 
This is going to be the on off button
and we have these buttons to go through the channels
um and then two volume buttons down here 
d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons 
And then  for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here
um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on 

and provides a very nice aesthetic when its all put away  um 
As far as the uh whole visible light thing  we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out 

Of course  if thats annoying for some people that function can be turned off  Um 

we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces
and what weve done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here
um f we call it fruity

of course thats uh interchangeable
and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued
but this is kind of something that can be done
um and as you can see on the television there
uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there 
Um  So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption 

if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel 

clearly theres gonna be some more colours and what not available 

Um I worried about the materials 

uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating

its not gonna break like some types of plastic thats dropped 

and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel 

I dunno if you noticed 
but I wrote the uh the companys name on the telephone screen 

Um  but I think thats I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote 

Um  did we come in under budget 

to put this into um production  were looking at about

It was twelve fifty Euro
um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine 

um obviously we had a choice with the buttons
whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons 
but we just went for a classic rubber button

So even though it has a lot of modern technology  um for example the voice recognition 
in a lot of ways its just a simple remote

Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option 

on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console
and uh I think its nicely designed into the into the overall look 
Um  but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with 

and um  I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not 
And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um  so 

Do we have um other  for lack of a better word  skins  Covers 

or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or 

we didnt quite have enough material uh 

as you can see this is just a most superficial layer
and um itd be very easy to put another layer of something else like

Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips
and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that 

we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier nonnatural look um materials

We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apples colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green 

Its not its not quite a a face plate 
its more like a pseudoface plate

it locks into place such that  you know  its pretty permanent
but at the same time  if we wanna go the other way its just a matter of a couple of adjustments
and we could go the face plate way

Very cool  nice job 

Um  what we need to discuss now is the finance of it  um

you provided a number
that actually sounds quite nice 
Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance 
Um  its a spreadsheet of the parts
and Ive just tentatively put in what its going to look like um 

if we can just itemize whats in here 

its a solar cell thing

With a backup battery 

The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area  Yeah 

Its a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time

Um and the case  its more of a singlecurved case 

Um and weve got a rubber skin material basically throughout 
Um  Push button interface um with this other dropdown
so maybe weve got two push button interfaces

And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well 

Cause it i it is very unconventional 

M come in at sixteen 

a bit over budget  um 

what we could do perhaps  a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells
um or take out the backup battery  Uh

I think that uh if were talking about it being one of our main selling features  being environmental and without the batteries and what not 

I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see

but youre gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time

and saying oh look my remote isnt working

I think in the longrun its better to keep the battery 

I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way were marketing this as like a natural  new thing 
but honestly if we cut that one piece out were actually coming in under budget

I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing
I mean thats what sets us apart

perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game

And the reality is you know  for me from an ideological stand point  Id like to stick with the uh the solar cell 
but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here
and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here
and maybe move ahead with the project  without the solar cell 

I think unfortunately thats our best option 

Cause we cant remove the push buttons

um  nor would changing the case materials 

Gotta do what you gotta do 

I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah 

I guess now we just go to the project evaluation

basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our products working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of
these are the things we needed to do 
these are the things that look like we feel theyre important 
Um so I was looking at basic design things 

are technologies up to where we hoped they would be

Is the design what we wanted it to do 

and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for  Um 

Does it respond to voice recognition 

Um  the only thing is with with the pullout panel  that is  can it take some adjusting

And overall  in general  it looks like its coming up to par 

but then  once you get used to it  it does make a lot of sense 
So I think overall were headed in the right direction 

They like that spongy feel 

I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options
and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff 

I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel

I got this slide from the coach

this ones a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair  um 

Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um

and Im not sure what its connected to 

I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like
and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth
and how that all worked  I guess  um 

As in within the team or 

I think so yeah 

Are we considering these points here 

I think theyre starting blocks

I think in general  for a days worth of work we actually were relatively productive 
considering the little amount of input we had going in 
Um  and the technology has definitely been a help 
its really been interesting to try out all this new stuff 

We didnt use the whiteboard at all 

No  no whiteboard 

and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed
but because of room constraints  doesnt really matter 

Um  also had I not been intrigued about the pen  I dont think I woulda used it at all 
I didnt write barely anything 

Was pretty cool tack though 

I am disappointed I didnt get a note back from my personal coach 

Attempts to contact coach ineffective 

n I think there was a lot of room for creativity 
we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us  um 

And even then we did get a decent product turned out
although its not everything we wanted it to be 

I think  yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually  I mean 

I think the teamwork was good as well 

My one my one criticism is that we didnt have enough colours to work with 

You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours 

What did you guys think about the the the roles 

I think it was pretty clever
cause we were never able to get too far off track
because the information came in at the right time
and kind of filled in the gaps enough 
At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up 

Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day 

but I didnt actually get any information for the last presentation at all 
Nothing  I didnt even get an email 

I feel like that was slightly lacking

when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing
um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was

and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more 

I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you

Yeah  already having the formatted stuff helped a lot 

cause if we didnt have that theres no way we could have got all that done in time 

And I think your leadership was quite good 

It was really good yeah 

I did get I I felt like I got way too into it 

But you guys felt that you could keep the  yeah  suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay 

except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand

Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all 

I think so 

No I  no I dunno  I d I I dunno 

I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasnt except for the actual building 
but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming  use the board

and this would have been six months worth of work  not like three hours worth of meetings 

is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board 

I didnt feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires 
I was afraid I was gonna break something actually 

and each time you get up its s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or 

I dunno what I woulda shown on that board 

its just like the paper I dont know what I really needed the paper for 

Usually I would do a lot more doodling too

I felt like I needed to be professional

I Im curious about what the debriefing is gonna be like 

is this all we need to get through 

Im not sure what the new ideas found i is about 

It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that 

thats the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file

I didnt change this one at all 

Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts 

Uh I think they still do their job 

how much can you do with a remote control 

how long was our meeting supposed to be 

I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval  um 
I dunno about you guys but I felt like a bit understimulated on the whole thing 

at the beginning it started out
and I felt actually like under pressure

and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing
and then suddenly I was like well its just another two minute presentation
that you guys dont really care about anyway

like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it

Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it
and then by the time I got to the last one I was like  you know  not very much 

Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste whats given to you into your presentation

every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides
or edited em 

My slides were all blank 
theyd have a title maybe

with the whole new background being innovative  yeah that was class 

An interesting day all in all I would say 

It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically  You know from the the the basics to the conce
although the whole concepts thing  the whole concepts phase  I dont think I really understood like the concept 

weve established that the costs werent really within budget 

We did the project evaluation based on um Sarahs evaluation of on off switches

though it was really technically an evaluation of the product  not the project in general 

And its all recorded 

Im supposed to do this final report thing at the end
so Ill put all that into the final report as well  or as much as seems like

uh I will save this into the project documents 

You guys ready to celebrate 

thats our last step  Celebration 

I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part 

I guess well call that a a doner 

thats the end of the meeting
