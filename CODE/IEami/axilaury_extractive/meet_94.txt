Well  welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design 

on the agenda for this  um  for this particular meeting  well have your three presentations on what youve done since our last meeting  after we came up with um some general ideas of our design 
And  um  then we have to make some key decisions on  on our remote control concept  and how were gonna make it  what uh materials were gonna use  and that sort of thing 
The meeting will be forty minutes long 
And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter 

Um  first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made 

Um  thes main internal feature is a circuit board  which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source 

Um  there are several components of  um  the circuit board that we need to consider  where well be getting them from  what theyll be made of 
Um  including the integrated circuit  which is also known as the chip 

Are they all included  like mandatorily  or r are these different options 

theyre all separate  apart from the chip  which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple  a regular  advanced 

so weve got flex flexibility with colours and things  with that as well 
Okay  there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source 
We could use a basic battery 

Theres a handpowered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago 

Kinetic energy is something thats been recently developed 

Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea thats being used by some watches and other devices  where you just shake the device and it gives it power 

Um  or theres solar power 
which weve been considering inside a building  which is where its gonna be used  might not be quite so useful 

Um  lots of considerations for the case  like what sort of shape it would be  curved or flat 

We dont want something thats huge and you cant pick up 

we could use metal 
we could use rubber
which might be more um ideal for the antiRSI 

Um  titanium is not gonna be possible  even though it just it beyond our budget really 

Um right our choice for buttons as well 

with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons 

theyre basically quite a flexible design  modern  you dont have to use individual buttons 

Um one thing with the scroll buttons though 

we would have to have an LCD um

and the glow in the dark thing might be difficult 

Um  also weve got the integrated pushbutton  which is what were most familiar with 

My personal preferences 
I think we could go for the kinetic energy source 

Its not been seen before  so it could be quite a  a novelty factor 

And also energy saving cause youre producing the energy  you dont need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels 

Rubber casing I thing would probably the best  if were going for the antiRSI and like more choice with um aesthetics 

And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple 

Another thing is it might be more difficult if its a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates 

Maybe if the  um  if it was just kind of a  more of a rubber coating which was on to a case 
So  it was kind of  the whole thing would be removable 

you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something  thats just its protective as well 

So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber 

is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber 

As far as I know  It should be 

Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack 

Like as a backup for something 

you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors 
but a lot of calculators  yeah  have solar power 

May maybe that could be the backup 

I think that might be a little impractical though 

Like if the kinetic thing  I think whats best about that is that its instant energy 

Um  Im just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now 
Uh  first of all Ill explain what a user interface is 

Um  there are two types of user interfaces 
Theres the graphical user interface  which emphasises the use of pictures for output
and a pointing device  for example a mouse for input control 

Im not really sure about the pictures that
maybe thats on an LCD screen 

Um  because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard 

so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard 

So you must  for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics 
Like an LCD screen 

Itd be more a command interface 

But if were having a simplified display anyway  w that  we probably wont have to focus so much on that 
Itll be more the on the numbers and the volume 

No I think its to do with the actual symbols that are on the  thats on the buttons of the remote control 

I think were gonna go with the command interface anyway 
to make it more simplistic 

We  we also have to keep in mind when were designing our  um  more userfriendly remote control  that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons 

that their functions  colours and forms arent always helpful 

It can be a bit  yeah  overwhelming 

But what about the lighting up effect 
Um  well  um  I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons theyd all light up 

I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards 

Id assume  like  an internal light  that comes through 
So there would have to  have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons  or something 

and well rubber is a more translucent product too 
so we have that taken care of 

Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe 

Cause if its just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone  You can like take off the hard cover and then theres the like say the buttons 

I dont think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the  the top casing 

this report is about uh trendwatching 

And the recent fashion update  uh  according to fashionwatchers in Paris and Milan  is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes  shoes and furniture 
Um  also  in contra uh in contrast to last year  the feel of the material is expected to be spongy 

um of course  as we  weve already talked about the personal faceplates in this meeting 
and Id like to stick to that 
The fruits and vegetable themes  I dont know if thats going to work for us 

Um  the temporary lightup idea  sounds like were gonna stick to that 

Yeah  its the fruits and vegetables is the only area that I find rather jarring 

Its  its a little but it  its everywhere 

I think we possibly could take a more abstract design 
Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables 

I mean we dont have to make something in the shape of a strawberry  but it could have the curves of a strawberry  or something 

I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting  we talked about our favourite animals 
So maybe there could be animalbased  you know 

Energy  weve decided on kinetic  right 

I  I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential 

It could even be one of our selling points 

I think we decided on the pushbuttons  right 

Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting  the interior lighting system 

So regular chip 

Uh  so thats the simple 

is regular not simple 

because of the lighting that weve decided to put in as well 

Well  I guess plastic and coated in rubber 

yeah  interchangeable plates 

and supplements 
Whats that all about 

what were gonna do about the cluster of button functions  colours and forms  in the in consistent use 

We havent really decided what to do about that 

just just the basic button functions 

Like we  I dont know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of

So were just going for power  channels  volume 

Should we have audio 

its a problem with the international uh appeal  I think  Um  if we have audio
because we dont know how other televisions work 

cause it  mm it is a good sales ploy to say  arent you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons 

We can just go for  make it a selling point that it is just the basic 

And  okay  in closing  cause we only have five minutes 

Um  youll be working  Poppy will be working on the lookandfeel design 

and um the user interface design  so this is where the trendy stuff comes in 
And youll be evaluating the product 

Poppy and Tara will have to work together  using modelling clay 
And  um  your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen 

Um  I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect 

seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research  I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something 

are you gonna come up with casing ideas 
Like f five different

Um  having the numbers kind of like  not a bunch of grapes  but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle 

what do yous think of this 

Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons  its true 

I guess what you i ideally youd kind of think of age markets as well 
So its a something that will  you know  appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds 

Kay well stick to the fruit and veggie theme then
