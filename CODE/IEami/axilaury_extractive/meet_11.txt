Kay so weve got our conceptual design meeting 

Kay so heres our agenda our agenda  Um
Im gonna open 

Im gonna take some notes 
Were gonna all do a presentation 
and then hopefully were gonna make some decisions now 

Im gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions 

Components design 

So so heres a look inside your really oldlooking remote control 
Um youve got a printed a printed uh circuit board here 
and youve got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate

So youve also got um youve got your chip here  your batteries here  and some sorta electronics  Um

so youve got heres heres a transistor  and this amplifies your signal 
um youve got the LED here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board 
Um youve got a couple diodes here for I dont know who and whatnot 

So um weve got a i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here  this is a eighteen pin um uh chip I dunno 
Uh its two double A batteries 
This is pretty standard remote 
So here are options for our power sources 
You can use a basic battery  which weve already discussed 
um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that 

So thats the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy 
so its like that flashlight where you have to shake it 
Uh weve got solar cells 
which I dont think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night

And finally weve got our cradle o our power cradle idea 

Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here 

I like the kinetic 

Well it is it is more uh I mean it is more ecofriendly than the than the cradle

We have uh choices in materials
and choices in the general shapes that we can do 
Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic  a rubber latex type thing  uh wood  or titanium 
If we go with titanium were gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do

Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche  wouldnt it 

I I cant see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote 

whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it 

Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell 
to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell
and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable 

The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we well have a lot more um options just in terms of shape

But basically these are curved and doublecurved
I I believe that the tech department  in their um in their message to me  that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom 
I have no idea exactly what theyre talking about 
but thats what they told me  uncurved  flat  curved  or doublecurved 

I think curved means just curved in one axis
and doublecurved is curved in two axes

Um okay  with the interface we have the following options 
we can u we can use push buttons 
we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button 
and LCD display 
or multiple scrolling wheels 
Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface 
For electronics  we have these very technical um descriptions here 
A simple chip  which is the least expensive 

a regular chip  which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh

D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip 

but I have no numbers to give you 

A simple chip is required to operate push buttons 
Um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the LCD display 
and it didnt say specifically  but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels 

Thats the end of my presentation 

Oh interface concept 

our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition 
They say they could put it to work
but um we dont think so 

It it it youll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and

I mean itll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show  its gonna change the channel 

But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize 

Well then why dont you just press the up button 
Even still theres gonna be interf th theres there still will be interference from the TV 

I think its a bad idea frankly 

Yeah so um taking that away  our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable
its the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage
and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it

Well  we wanna small r remote control one side
because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed 
but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost 

But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow well do that  Somehow 
Um so the the what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh
but without with a l a less complicated um design 
so the numbers  the volume control  and channel control  and teletext access 
Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial 
And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext 

So were suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume 

i i its just four buttons that are on a cross 

um yeah so I think we w we go for something midsized 
so something looks good
and uh is not too prone to get lost 

Trend watching I guess 

When I s when I see the when I see the product I I I I dont wanna buy it 

Theres nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there 

Are you talking about the picture 
Thats not our thats not our b design 

Okay cause cause right now I dont have too much to say about how to market this product
because we dont have a product to market yet 
And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now 

Uh without special or increased marketable features I dont believe the product has a consumer demand 
Uh I like the idea of of the scroll

what Im looking for as marketing is m give me something different 
I give me a lower price 
give me a higher price 
give me some new technology 

when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give thats

Id Id say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though  the then we have that as well 

Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle
and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior 

Just remember when I made up this report I didnt have the information that were discussing here 

so what Im saying is  from my perspective  I dont have a product to market right now 
Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost  either lower
or develop an integrated new technol technology 

Yeah uh again Im not sold on the product
because we dont have a product in my opinion yet 

If you if you give me if you give me a cutout of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost 

So our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle 
Do we go basic or do we go for features 
Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that offhand first 

Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do 

Yeah  Well its its just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do 

now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons 
So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something thats unique 

What I understand about scroll wheels is theyre theyre quite expensive to to make 

if if were gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe its worth it to do it 
but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down 

No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but

my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh dock to put it in to to charge it 
We can target like environmentally friendly ideas  that sorta things 

Its gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle 

What type of casing 
I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber 

Im thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens  you know 

and then its not really rubber

where theres you have plastic bits

but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside 

or do we want if were ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go LCD 

d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons 

Or from from my perspective I think LCD is a mistake

and all youre doing I mean its youre not gonna get any information back from the television 
so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last

so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something theres no s I dont see the 

So  what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this 

Well we have to I think for me its still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be 

You know the other thing I thought about was you know  do we go to something like this 
Make a remote that doesnt look like a remote 

Well I dunno about like the flipphone idea 

I mean what I see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is  when you got children  their their stuff gets inside the circuitry  they get dirty  they get messy with drinks and stuff 

And what I keep throwing out there I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different 

and I guess th th the question th th that youre being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product 
or do we really need the scroll wheel as well 
Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost 

Um were probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip  s I would imagine 

The locators gonna require a radio transmitter 

I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator  I think those are two very strong features 

I know personally that would be a very attractive feature  is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control 

And its presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep 
But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap 

So the scroll wheel  in or out 

Mm pr my personal preference is out 

For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad 
I dont know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be 

I I think theres you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers 
and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing 

Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid  is a lot of TVs wont re the TVs wont respond exactly the same 

so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes  and itll be like flip  flip  flip 

You could basically make it so that itll I mean its just gonna be sending a signal to the TV yeah the TVs ge so if you send about five flip channels  if you did that its gonna flip once 

it just might be frustrating where you cant make it go as fast as you want 

Now the the only thing I I on the interface side of it  is that I I I see the dilemma 

So I can go uh presuming I have  on my television  something that tells me what channel Im on  I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two 

cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button  Okay 
So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system 

so if maybe if we had an LCD up the top that just did a number on it  right 

Itll tell you when you flip the channel on the TV 

How would you program it though 

Well you just its one extra button 
You say programme start  and then type in

And again we have another another great marketing tool 

The problem were gonna have is making it robust 

Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes  between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one  up two 

well then you just have  you have a diff you have a mode switch 

So right details th that weve talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel 
We want a mode indicator 
We want backlit buttons 

Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the midmarket range 

though we havent got to a stage where were ready to pin down the price of components 

So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to 

I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached 

I would say thirty five to forty 

Yeah  I was gonna say thirty five to fifty 

Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay 

Lets lets try and think now  how much would you pay for

But youve gotta think who our target market is

Okay so well come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber  robust  with scroll wheel  with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff  favourite channels  and and with a cradle  and yeah and the locator 

The next meeting starts in thirty minutes 

So weve got more than a thirty minutes 

Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh

With a cradle  radio transmitters  and backlit buttons 

Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip  sorta thing or for
