Uh I think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves
and everybodys name and what your function is 

Yeah  my name is Francina 
And Im uh an user interface

And Im a marketing person 

My name is Eileen 

Yeah  Uh Im JeanneOui 
Um uh my role is industrial designer

And as you already know I am Betty 
I am the project manager for today 

This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control 
Uh should be original  trendy  and  of course  user friendly 

That is its gonna be individual work and then at the meeting well discuss what uh we have come up with 

Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve 

The same goes for the conceptual design 

Detailed design  same thing basically 

Then  tool training try out the white board 
participant can draw their favourite animal 

You wanna go Eileen and

And remember you have to press so it works 

Heres the project finance
Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro 
Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro 
the market range unlimited meaning international
and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro 

now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didnt like with it  things you would like to change  things you would like to improve with this thing

Yes  I I feel that all the remote should be very compact 

And um and it should have multipurpose 
Like uh the remote control which we use for TV  it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also  like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for airconditioners  or for heating system 

At um twelve fifty Euros per
Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that 

It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have 

Yeah  design should be  yeah it should be different 

Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know 

I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap 

Well or yeah or if its really  if its really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal 

maybe it should have a light so that we can  we can just recognise where it is 

and I I think uh voice or clapping its not specific enough 

The industrial designer Thats you 

Uh working design  yeah  its its uh mainly technicalfunctional design 

so so you are the working design 
So you have a working design and then a functional design 
And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification 
like friendliness  and what we just discussed in general 

Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes 

I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with
