So is the agenda 
Opening  acquaintance  tool training and project plan  discussion and then closing 
Project aim is a new remote control 
Its original  uh trendy and its userfriendly 

Try out the whiteboard 
every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal 

so  I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working 

Okay  project finance 
selling price twenty five Euros 
profit aim fifty million Euros 

Market range internationally sold 

its gotta be cant cost any more than twelve fifty to make 

Next meeting starts in thirty minutes 

I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where 

Yeah  I think were I mean before we close the meeting  were supposed to come up with some ideas for

Oh k so were actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or

Right  whos got experiences with remote controls then 

Is this a TV one we are supposed to make 

Yeah  Yeah its a TV remote control 

Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something thats thats big and

I mean  you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of TV
and if you have whatever associated with TV the DVD player  or something like that 
but like at the same time you dont wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something 

Cause I I I mean I was thinking something thats got different like maybe a a an LCD display on it thats got different pages for different devices 
but that would p that would probably be quite expensive 

and then after we after weve found out what we can like  some different ideas  we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not 
So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things 

Couldnt we have like one that comes out 

you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner  and um into one basically 

Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the DVD and VCR access and stuff 
and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel  program plus and minus  and the just the mute button  for example 

Im not sure if its a good idea to have a two sided remote though 
cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it 

No  but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold

or something like a flip telephone  something like that maybe 

Okay  Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface 

I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception

I think we should also have a backup plan of I

but also devices connected to the to the TV  I mean  be able to operate
DVD players  things like that 

cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that

but the the functions that were sure that we want are that it can control the TV 

We should have a backup plan of just a really good television remote control  that just that is just for a TV  but its just a really good  nice one 

But whatll make it whatll make it interesting for people to buy though 

have it be like ergonomic so its comfortable to use 

Or maybe even so something thats for disabled people

or big buttons for touchy buttons for

I think a flip up thing 

like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones 

User Interface Designer  thats thats

so you gotta you go  youre youre gonna be the one thats working out what what buttons we need  Um 
Industrial Designer  you are the one  you know  youre gonna be working out kind of box it goes in  I guess so  um

Mm  Har how it works an

And in marketing
User requirements specifications 

Do you think our two kind of overlap  because

Yeah  it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap 

You two you two are gonna be just  I think  you just double up  you know  you working together 
Youre the one thats gotta go and find out do th do the research
