Um  Ill just review what we did in our last meeting 
Um  under marketing we targeted our audience 

Um  then we considered some design options with how it should look 

So Ive been looking at the components design 

Um  so we need some custom design parts  and other parts well just use standard 
Um  I assume well be custom designing our case 

And well need to custom desi design a circuit board 

Um  standard parts include the buttons and the wheels  um the iPodstyle wheel 

And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote 

Um  we can use rubber  plastic  wood or titanium 
Um  Id recommend against titanium

Um  and the rubber case requires rubber buttons  so if we definitely want plastic buttons  we shouldnt have a rubber case 

Uh  well we can use wood 
I dont know why wed want to 
Um and also we should note that if we want an iPodstyle wheel button  its gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip 

Um  can I do next  Cause I have to say something about the material

and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh  fancy look and feel 
Um  Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that 
And th last thing is the easy to use um factor 

Um  our fashionwatchers in Milan and Paris have decided  well noticed  that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend

So we want to put the fashion electronics  we need to go fruit and vegetables 
And also go for a spongy feel 

I dont know how spongy can be achieved but apparently thats the way to go 
Um  I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables 

should we print the fruit stuff  or should the actual remote look like a fruit 

were gonna try to talk about  um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this iPodish remote control  based on fruit vegetable design 
And  um  basically  so  this is a touched ba a touchbased graphical interface system 
Uh  so people are going to be looking at this little screen 

I mean I assume  are we still on the screen idea 

it seems like you would need a screen 

But the screen can come up on the telly  the she said 

Okay so if were not gonna have a screen I think

So basically its just gonna be a wheel then 

I guess thats wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen

So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if

I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the TV like what channel youre on 

I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of  you know  range we need to have on the wheel 

And then theres also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television 

You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in 
which is more expensive than the regular chip  which is more expensive than the minimal 

that  like  then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the TV

Yeah  well we dont want the screen I guess 

I mean  if youre thinking of the design of it now  like the a you know  physical attributes 

I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing 

So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before 

Like  I think were looking at something that could be  like like even maybe like a cir Im f Im seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing 

W when we had the wheely remote control  we it was on the top I think  if you held it like that 

What if  um  you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you dont use very much 

So I guess we have to look into the  um  like  the programming  how this how they actually programme these things  and if thats

Oh how they make the menu show up on the TV 

I believe its ins its gotta be inside the TV  not inside the remote 

But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out 

What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that Im dreading 

one of the material options is a sort of rubber thats in like those stress ball things 

But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda

um you could just have covers and then your mobile f its like a mobile phone thing 

You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit  apple machine and they have like the blueberry  like all the colours are named after fruits 

If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what youre actually holding in your hand 

and then theres more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is 
And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable thats on there 

see youre thinking  its weird  youre thinking the opposite of me

Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit 

oh so so youre saying the squishy parts like detachable 

so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing  and then you could have like the banana squishy thing

and for now we can do two prototypes maybe

So where are the fruit and vegetables now 

I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front  or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath 

we we should have the logo somewhere on it 

I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case 

Uh we actually had an option of batteries  solar power  and um a dynamo 

Oh  a dynamo is ah  its a bicycle  Its a bicycle mechanism 

Yeah  the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where youd basically have to wind it yourself 
So I sort of picked battery 

No  But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is  the moment you move it  it c it creates energy on its own 

So if you throw it  its gonna store loads of energy  and you dont need to buy a battery cause theyre quite f I find them annoying 
But we need to find cost 

Does anyone have costs on the on the web 

All it said was it gave sort of relative  some chips are more expensive than others  sort of things 
It didnt give me any actual cost 

Like the chip is probably the most expensive part 

Oh when we move on  you two are going to be playing with playdough 
Um  and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design 
And youre gonna be doing protu product evaluation
