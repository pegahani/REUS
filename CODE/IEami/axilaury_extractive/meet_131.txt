Um  once again Im uh gonna take minutes 

Uh  first we have a prototype presentation by G and G 

Uh evaluation crit criteria 
Uh  in combination with the finance I um uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file
which we have to fill in later on 

Uh  and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro 

And after that  uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard  with the with our laptops  with the all uh all this 

Once again  forty minutes 

I would g give the word to um G and G for the prototype presentation 

Shall I give a short introduction and then uh

Yeah  well sure 

Um  this was our first concept 
We decided to use a single touchscreen 

And um  well  we began with uh with a form of shape  that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand  left or right handed 

Um well  during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top  usable with your thumb 
and uh the menu structure  uh if necessary  with your other hand 

Yeah  uh well  and as you saw  we would just have the basic remote with the panel LCD uh screen 
Well  these would be the main buttons 
h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to 

We have the more advanced menu uh setting right here 
We have the submenus and stu stuff 

As you can see  this uh there  there are uh two uh weird bumps in it 
This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic 

And so when you put it on the table  it will just lay down 

The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers 

But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff 

you can make a more thinner uh design 

So  you have room here for your battery

S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip 

Uh  you can see theres a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior 

its like an uh Easter egg 

Yeah  its like an e but this is for children 
We we want a more adult version 

So this actually basic the idea 
We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this 
And and for colours  we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey 
Those are the technological colours actually 

It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable 
so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple 
but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control  it would be less appealing than a white one 
And young people  we think  are a little bit more flexible 
they think  ah Ill buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh

Maybe its an idea to sell it without a cover  so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop 

um I think a cover is necessary 

So  there must be some cheap standard cover 

Yeah  but uh you d you mustnt forget that uh our target aim is younger people 

So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard 
and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated  more traditional look  theyre willing to pay uh that 

Yeah  Yeah  maybe yeah  perhaps youre right 

Uh  maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style 

a wood style  a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours 
And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour  but not too not too much 

But  the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours 
Not too  but w a little 

Um  now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh to the past requirements 

Um  were going to do that with a seven point scale 

We have to uh be consensive about about things 

Were going to vote 

The remote control is designed for people with age below forty 

Yeah  its not just uh designed for people under the age of forty  Its also designed for people above forty 

Yeah  two or three 

The remote control is beautiful 

acco according to us  its one  Or

Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product 

Uh  the remote control looks fancy 
One 

The remote control has big  clear channel switching buttons 

Yeah yeah 

Uh  teletext buttons and volume buttons 

Teletext is in the menu 

Volume is true 

Yeah  the they are big and clear  

I would give it a more a five or a six 

The remote control is easy to be found 

Uh well  when we put in fancy colours  yeah

Yeah  it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape 

If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed  or you throw this remote control under your bed  is it better findable 

Itll make a difference 

Well  we p we can do it glow in the dark 

Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false 

uh  w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls  there may uh uh be there in your uh TV room  this one will stand out  I think 

if this lying on your couch  youre youre you think whats that for kinda orange uh thing 

If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer  uh you find it  yeah 

But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it 

Yeah  thats stupid 

Most of times when you lose it youre sitting on it  Uh

the remote control has fresh  fruity colours 

Um I would call uh choose two 
cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours  as it would not 

Yeah  yeah  not too flashy 
The remote control is made of soft material 

Yeah  rubber  is kind of soft 

Yeah  but not too soft we have decided 
Three  yeah 

Easy to use  One 

Its its not the most easy to use

Jus just with ten buttons  thats the easiest 
Yeah  but the most uh easy to use is just with one button

It is r it is rather easy to use  because you have the primary buttons always visible 

Okay  two  Yeah  two 

The remote control is innovative 

The remote control has m remova removable from Multilux 

The remote control has builtin games 

But uh  maybe make it two  because the games are in a submenu and not uh its not an entire game 

Yeah  but they are built in  so its one 

The remote control  i it has speech recognition 
False 

And the last  paren parental advisory function 

Okay  we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost 

Yeah  if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro  uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation  as we have uh experienced it 
Otherwise  we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy  So

Kinetic  one 

Battery  yes  One 

Advanced chip 

So its only uh once doublecurved 

Were now in a problem  cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet 

Then well see uh well well see uh wha how much we are over budget 

Special uh is the special colour 

Yeah  but we want to make uh the wood colours  uh that uh

No  this is a standard colour 
Yes  this is a special colour 

Yeah  if if youre honest  well uh type one  special colour 

Yeah  but but D but Daniel  tha thats thats another brand 
Thats another article

Well  were only four Euro over budget 

Well  other case  we can make it singlecurved or uncurved 

Mm  singlecurves 

The kinetic thing  can we just skip it 
because uh you have to shake it  but thats not really innovative 

What do you think about uh putting a battery in it  but also selling like uh the covers  a docking station

But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway  just you s you have to recharge them manual 

well you you can go from doublecurved to singlecurved 

so we have to bake the ba back flat  and then
No  its its just one curve and not a back uh curved I think  Or

but uh its its well its its r it is the main point of the the the the look 

No advanced chip  uh thats a little bit of problem 

So  if we do this  uh were on uh twelve and a half Euro 

If you make it doublecurved  it costs one Euro more 

Uh  theres an a a athe aesthetic value  but not functionality 

But I dont know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price 

Yeah  well lets assume it is 

But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion 

No  well  y I mean uh  y you can go into your neighbour and tell him  ha  my k uh remote control is kinetic 

Yeah  but it doesnt fit in our co cost profile  So

because if you want to go to kinetic  youre uh youre on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat 
and I think now its its more of uh a compromise

Well  we were above  so we did a little redesign

now uh its about time to uh talk about uh this project 

was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings 

But  thats mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us 

I I didnt think so  That there was a lot of room for it 

and I couldnt go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff  Bu

Well  I th I think you two  uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel  you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project 

I think Jeroen and I  we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two 

Uh how about the leadership 

I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting 

but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more 
So like  I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting  and

I was a I was also very uh unhappy  uh very unsatisfied uh about the

and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk

Yeah  more more consensus 

No  it you did better 

Uh  teamwork 

Well  we work together on a project  but everybody has his own task 

and its wo more like presentation and some points were discussed 
But  really teamwork were you two uh

Nah  Yeah  we we had some trouble with the pen  but

D uh just write your name right now 

Uh he he knows how it works  yeah 

The idea is great  but it doesnt work properly  Uh

Its its not real real use for me 

I its the same concept as the pen  where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow 

Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things 

And the eraser was another problem 

M Abo What kind of new ideas 

Well  the the idea of the touchscreen is uh

New ideas about uh the working of this software  about about the project  about the remote controls or

I dont know what what I mean 

the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six 
So thats fairly uh fairly good  I think 

all the requirements uh are true or very true  right  Yep 

People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it  and

You had expected it to to be uh more more uh

More userfriendly 

And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that youre drawing on this screen 

And writing text uh  yeah  youve gotta really do your best to write some

Just t t type text  and that that would be uh excellent 

Here  Picture from scanner  clipart 

But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh

So there the the the functionality is there 
but its not its not ideal 

it costs a lot of time to uh

To use  yeah 

Uh  the costs are within the budget 
Uh  the project is evaluated 

because uh there must be some kind of end report 

Uh about all the meetings  what we have decided 

here is uh standing uh whoa  we can celebrate now  but the end report is

You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report 

Maybe we can do it uh together 

So I I s I will uh put it on a storyboard 

Um  this is about the functional design 

but you can save it u the under another name 

Its a readonly version 

about the three functions where uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control 
Um  it must be uh simple to use  very clear what to do  and at the younger people 

No  you have to put uh  switch channels uh at the top  because thats the most used function and teletext at the second

a volume changing  second 

S switch  yes 

then the conceptual design 

Well  okay  maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost 

Uh  he here it is still doublecurve  the rubber  the flashy  the fruity  the removable 

Its not double 

Nay but that this is what um

Was initial  the plan  The initial plan 

And the the added functions like Tetris snake 

the added functions  Uh  was it included in the cost 
I dont think so  eh 

Okay  so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh

Yeah  the end conclusion 

thats thats what Im gonna write b between now 

Yeah  but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion  I think 

well I gonna redesign uh something now 

Oh  before you change anything maybe you um save it first 

Finish meeting now 

Im going to finish my end report
