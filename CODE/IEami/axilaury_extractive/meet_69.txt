Im just gonna go over real quickly um some news Ive just got from the board on how were supposed to do with this um remote control 
And then Im gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what youve found
and then well have a bit of discussion 

what Ive just found out from the board

but it needs to be television only 

were not doing DVD 

Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it 

thats red and black 
And it has to have the slogan  case you guys forget the slogan its  we put fashion in electronics 
Um and no teletext 
Im not sure what teletext is

so we dont wanna include that um in this particular design 
For reasons that I dont really know 

but its the board so there you go 

given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design
well discuss it later

Im gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation

Were gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project 
Um remote control works as follows 

Um sends message to another system 

theres an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power  something along those lines 
theres an integrated circuit 
which is the microchip 

and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system 
A user interface controls the chip 
basically thats the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well 

and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands 
And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals 
Um too much metal is used sometimes

and theres also the possibility of the remote catching on fire

just think of those lawsuits  thatd be really bad 
Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction 
Um  components  Just some ideas that I had 
um  energy source 
its kinda hip to be eco friendly
so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup 
Um the user interface 

since we cant use metal
I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic 
The chip  um  silicon based chip I dont really see any way around that 

Um  the sender well Im thinking infrared
cause it is the industry standard 

Uh PAL and NTSC compatible
and uh probably a two hundred foot range 

Um personal preferences 
I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal 

which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value 

Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers  or mo modern types of plastics
that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value

on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice 

Yeah that shouldnt be a problem 

Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation thatd be great as well 

Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation 

Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device 
it needs to be universal
um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices
although we now uh find that uh that thats no problem 

Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set 
Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television  uh switch to the next channel  that sort of thing 

some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control
sorry that we cant quite see my red there very well
but uh this remote control has many functions

but it uh it is quite complicated
and most users will find it uh find that they wont use most of the functions
because they dont know how to use them
and dont wanna take the time to learn how to do it 

Um  Another remote control  slightly different 
its a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions 
um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use 
Um it also has a bit of a cheap look
and its also quite boring 

my personal preferences 
Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control 
Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device
but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with 

Um  Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face

I was looking through some marketing reports that weve got
and we had a usability test
where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use TV remotes
and see what it is that theyre using
and then they filled out a questionnaire
about what they like and what they dont about their general TV remote control practices 
Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time  everybodys used to using changing the channel  turning it on  using the volume 

the majority of the time thats all thats going on 

for some people theyre important 

the other functions happen 

but the primary uses are really really basic 
Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general publics use 

they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they dont know what to do with 
And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people  their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it  And then they cant find it in the room 
So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something  will really come into play with a lot of these people 
Um theres also a survey about what they liked about remotes 
and pretty much they all think theyre hideous and not very useful 
and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options 
I dont know if thats something were ready to look into technically 

but it is s something worth thinking about 
especially since the younger demographics obviously the one thats gonna keep growing 

Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice  which are

I think weve covered most of these important questions through this um through you guyss presentations
um weve got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic 
Um Sarah  shes recommended that we go for simpler functions  so fewer functions
um but we need to decide who are we selling this to 
you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted  thought about voice control 
um so do we wanna go for that 
or do we want to go for an older demographic 

if were gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um 

Were not catering to the pensioners of the world I dont think so 

So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic 

uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster
um think were constrained to plastics

weve got this idea  Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way its looking um 

this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that its doable  um at least for the basic controls 

you cant say record alias tonight at seven PM
but we might be able to say um volume up 

I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology 
With a simple command like locate 
And then it could start to beep

The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldnt speak into the remote that youre trying to find 

but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know thats just a little chip or whatever that has the page button  maybe that could be voice activated too 

A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television 

but yeah I like that  I like that  the voice recognition for the paging system 

The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control 
So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market 

and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not 

Are we still thinking about this screen

if were gonna do this touch pad screen thing  it would be still  do we know if thats an option technically right now to that 

Ive looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not 
they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point 

especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions 

S definitely an option technically 

menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition  settings  things

Gotta wonder though  if were adding so much technology to this one remote  are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things 
It seems like  were not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip 

I guess well cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development

Im seeing that were gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group  aim it at them 

but basically well make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control 
Um I think this voice recognition thing is a weve got a market for it

I guess weve c weve touched on most of this  The idea of a paging function  a touch screen  and face plates  Um 

wed have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen 

I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable 
We could have the casing  the the face plates 

We have to ask whether were going to include a certain number of face plates with the package 

Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldnt really go anywhere 

in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around 

whereas youre just sit at home 

we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth  um 

but yeah we will have to evaluate whats most important 

have we confirmed that were gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um

Yeah I think that would be best 

based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me lets go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased

try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic

With a touch screen for the basic functions  Um

lets provisionally lets go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff

basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen 

it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls 
Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost 

Cause it would have a docking base 

But then again that costs as well 

these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen 

I cant see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in

if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple

Um its th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off  channels  volume  um

Even if you cant do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button
thats just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control

to emit some kind of paging  Just a beep 

Since were doing uh touch screen  do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that 
Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody 
What what would be on that touch screen 
Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um
logo or something or motto 

its my understanding that if you were going to do a skin youd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control 

Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen 

itll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while its loading

Im wondering how were gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device 

Comes on every time you turn it on and then thats it
cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think 

it seems like it would suffice to have just the RR on there 

People arent gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on 
They just want it to be on and ready to go 

But then again who wants to turn on a remote control 

all you have to do is touch the screen
and it automatically goes on 

or go into like a dormant mode 

Im gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders 

and the minutes that Ill do it in a second
and put them in the shared folder for later reference 

Ive put my files in the shared folder as well
