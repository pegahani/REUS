I hope youre ready for this uh functional design meeting 

I will take the minutes
you mm you three are going to do presentation 
Um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new projects requirement

we need uh to know the the user uh needs

we want to know how it going to work

third part uh I dont remember

lets go for the three presentations 
so first um Marketing Expert 

So as you know  you I think you already know me  Sammy Benjo 
I am the expert in marketing
and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls 

what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control  lets ask people who are users of remote controls

what they like 
what they dont like

So weve weve conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls

what we found was that uh there are several things that the user dont like in remote controls 
First of all  they find it very ugly 

uh theyre not nice colour  not nice shape 
I mean theyre all the same 

Um what is interesting
is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control 
so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um 

and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls 

And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use

For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often
so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality

And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used 
so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using 

people are very frustrated w with their remote controls
and they for instance uh they dont even find it
its its often lost somewhere in the in the in your home

Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please  where are you 
Like uh something to to like t I think phones  Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality 

And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls

that nobody use 

so most of the the people say they they dont know how to they to use properly their r remote controls 

And uh they are bad for RSI
but uh I dont remember what is RSI 

Yeah  its electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect 

but we have to take this into account 

now I remember what is RSI
its repetitivity stress injury 

So weve listed a couple of uh

Functions 

that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls

but what is important
is to understand that the power button is not used often
because in general you use it only once per session 
but it is very relevant 
People want to have a power button 
Channel selection is uh o often used very often used

Volume is not often used
but people uh want to have control on volume

And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings  Audio settings  screen settings  even teletext and channel settings 
All of them  theyre not often used
and they are s more or less relevant 
It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant 

but seems that its average relevant at least  so 

I have been told that we uh dont consider teletext 
that its out of date now because of internet 

if if there are good reason not to put teletext its okay

One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control 
so you wouldnt have to tap tap in your buttons
but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want 
So weve conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control
and as we can see it really depends on the age 
Young people  probably because its a buzz word  find it very relevant 
And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down 
So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control 
I think if we are targeting young people then uh its probably something we have to consider 
If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really dont know why they this should be

so thats basically my findings 

should we aim at the young people or not 

I think we should aim at the young people 
But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device 
In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people 

Then teletext is useless for them I think 

Because they they have other means of finding their information  Yeah 

my name is Mark Dwight 
and um I am responsible for User Interface Design 
However  uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design 

thats gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this 

And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task

We should never complicate things too much 
We should only make a remote control  nothing more  Nothing more than this  just a remote control 
Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use 

So here is this remote control 
Its quite a standard one 
but its not from a TV 
its from a much easier device like air conditioning or something 
But you know  we can use it for a TV easily 
Only buttons we need is on off  volume  channels and maybe some options or something else 

I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button 

Maybe it can be yeah middle of like  between those two

compared to this one

Our question of the style  we should remember that our company
puts fashion into electronics

For personal preferences I think that to make a babyproof remote control it got to be a titanium 

It is unbreakable
and it is very universal 
W well have a screen with a back light
which can change colours 
and we can put all the options into this screen 
Well need only few buttons 
All the other things can be controlled through the screen 
And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click 

I would propose this concept for design  just few buttons  a screen with a back light which can change colours  titanium

We need power and volume 
And let us include two nice features into this device 
first  power on and off can be made fully automatic 
When you go to the sofa  take your control
and point it to the TV 
the TV turns on 

And when does it turn off 

When you dont touch the control

For for enough time

And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control 
Suppose you set u you set up some volume
and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room
and take your control with you 
Like  you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something  and then the volume changes 

Uh Im not sure about the screen 

According to your distance to and the angle maybe  if you have a stereo system 

wha what is the use usefulness of the screen 
Uh is it a touch screen by the way 

I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left  right  up  down and enter 

but uh it has to be with an back light somehow 

So basically thats it 

Um I see that you target uh several s application not only TV
but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control 

Can be easily done 

Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control
I think we will only concentrate on TV for the moment
and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah 

but its quite universal you know 
We can just extend it to any device 

for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five  how would I do can I do that with this 

You know these days we have hundreds of channels 

In fact I would propose another solution 
Basically you use just four or five channels 

set up your TV set like channels that you use theyre one  two  three and five 
and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel 

But even we can have some uh LCD display 
like you can uh de you can just button the number

One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap 
So even if they are only watching four or five channels  I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels 

on zap its only next next next next next  yeah 

But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers

Mm  We got these buttons here  Next next 

Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button
and you can change mode zapping mode or

uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices 

but since we are focusing only on TV remote controls
so we can have more functions for TV

Could we carry out some research if we w really need this 
like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four 

Ill check in my department if theres someone specialist in that 

Uh as you know  I am mister Ramaro 
I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices

So now Ill briefly describe the working design of our remote control 

as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device  like TV or VCR or DVD player etcetera 

So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions  what we want on this portable device 

so to do these functions we need an interface 
which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that 
And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message
and then it will process by the chip
and then it will generate some information to the main device 

uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control
mainly the energy source like the battery
and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want 

we ought to have some kind of processor

And then well have the infrared LED source

Then well have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations 
and we ought to do different codes for different TVs 

To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh 

because the people dont use one particular brand so

So we need to check their specifications

So we need to have particular encryption codes 

so Ill input the connections to all this components 

so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them 

Mmhmm  And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard  or mm 

and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy 
we can have another  like uh s simple speech recogniser on our DSB chip 

and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip
so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser

you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things  yeah 

Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them 

And what about the price of this component 

Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that 

The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume
or or it will be something like volume  up  down 

And then we can have channel they can say  okay I want eight 

we dont want like BBC or CNN or something else

it will be complicated

First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons 

actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on  on and off  this processor

Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition 
Like  if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like
roll em up
or roll em down 

Very expensive 

what about the idea of automatic on off on the button  yeah 

even automatic on off is also a bit problematic 

like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they dont touch the remote
and mm y you dont know how much time you need to switch on or switch off

So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control 
We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings 

Yeah that can be possible  especially for power settings 
so user can say okay  suppose theyre watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I

were now going to l have the lunch break 
Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work 
and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting 
and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components

you will focus on the component concept um
uh of course the UID Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept
and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching 

of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach 

And we have um maybe we have to we say  only for TV  not teletext 
Uh I think automatic on off control uh its not possible 

But speech recogniser can be possible 

Uh  should it be equipped with the uh  with uh speakers 
Like  you want to find it  you shout

and it answers is Im here  Or

But thats ex thats expensive  Uh 

Just beeps 

I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them

because of the the frequency they they just answer to that 

You can clap  Can you 

But its a good feature I guess yeah

were done 

lets go to lunch 

because we have only very few words like like power  switch on or some like

so we try to only recognise those words
and and because we cant really say user to say same wording
