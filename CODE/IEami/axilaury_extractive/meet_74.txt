Okay were back for the conceptual design meeting 

Um were gonna open it and Im gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager 
Were gonna have three presentations 
And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts

Okay  so trend watching 

fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like  fancy versus functional 
and then it has to also be technologically innovative  and yet easy to use 
So the customer basically is confused 

So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing  shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns 

um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year 

Um  But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns  I dont know if we really want to go with that 

um we need easy to read like large buttons  clearly labelled

And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something 

So what we could do is something like an oldfashioned telephone

where we put the buttons around  like wed put a big onoff button or something else in the middle 

So its classically retro 

looking at the interface concept  its gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this 

Um uh cant really see  but theres two possible ways 
on the r left  if you see on th on the sides of of the remote  you have the sort of scroll down 

And then on the right  we have whats really big trend right now  its the iPod 

and its sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip  but also very sleek and um and very simple  but technologically advanced 

Um theres the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight 

for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know youre looking at the up and down arrow 

Um this is particularly geared towards children 

Um and you have the shapes and its very simplistic and friendly looking 

and then down at the bottom you have the logos
and thats where you could put the RR  Real Reaction 

But its sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying  well out of this one we like  you know the round section of um  b or wed like the the button size on this 

So basic remote operation runs as follows 

we need rubber for buttons  aluminium for battery y contacts  integrated circuit which consists of a diode  transistor  resonator  resistors  and a capacitator 

um contact discs for the buttons  plastic for the casing  and a powersource 
whatever powersource weve actually determined we want 

They suggested power options  solar cells  hand dynamo  and kinetic power 

Um Im not sure how the hand dynamo works 

We can offer options for casing such as straight  curved  doublecurved  you know 
very specific to the customer 

Um certain restrictions do apply here though 

And uh so you functions what for the buttons  scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves 

Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips
and theyve just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip  which we could utilise 
Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip 

Let me just add one more thing that I couldnt say before 
and thats just that theres the new technology that theyve developed on the voice recognition 

um theres a sample sensor and theres a sample speaker unit for
So  you would say like  good morning  coffeemaker  and it would respond  good morning  Jill 

Im not sure exactly how its gonna work  cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions 

I feel like voice recognition would be  I dont know  w it would be too hard to really

If its within our price to get that kind of chip that would  you know  technology

But  I guess  we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway 

lets lets see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost  Um 

Its not gonna be a huge universal remote 

cause it still fits in your hand  so you still wanted something thats comfortable and substantial  but not necessarily full of buttons 

If we do a voiceactivated locator  though  were gonna be looking at a more substantial chip 

Honestly  I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base

I think if we had a a locating device with the small one  I think that seems way more advanced 

Okay  so what kind of material do we want to be made out of 

I dont think wood is a viable option 

Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium 

I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right nowIm
not sure that well have the time and money to produce a whole array of

uh since were going with batteries instead of solar power  Id recommend maybe a uh soft like latex 
because we could produce  you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour 

um we could do f a cherry cover for this year

So we could do like a b a hard base plastic  and then we could give two latex covers to start 

Are we gonna go with the voice activated

I think we should just do um the recognition for when its lost  you know 

because people could just be talking and we dont want it going off all the time 

Uh and what size batteries  double A  triple A 

or we could do one small lithium 

I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial 

because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it 

cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle  then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are 

which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a handshape like if we put the the scrollbutton on the side 

Well  the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side 

Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the RR like that 

I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though 

or if were going for the retro look  I think  like a really shiny black would be cool 

or like a gunmetal grey 

Im just really wary of the putting anything on a button 

Itll wear off 

so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be 

Like a little cutout kind of

Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact  they could illuminate yellow 

The ID is going to do the look and feel design 
the UID the user interface design 

Okay  and right now  the ID and UID  you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay 

I think youre going to get a lot of  I mean  the final say on what buttons get put

Kay  And youre gonna do some product evaluation
