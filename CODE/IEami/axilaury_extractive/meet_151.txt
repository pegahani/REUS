Detailed design

Prototype presentation  well first

Its basically what we agreed upon 
but just a little bit more specified 

Basically in what we discussed  cover and buttons will be made of rubber  yellow colour  black components 

We chose a different type of colour for the menu  A bit darker yellow

And it I guess its more easier to just paint it on the rubber

So we have its a bit round shaped 

We chose the buttons to be uh teletext  okay button  favourite channel and the mute 

We have battery power 
we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor  The sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway 

we have sin one curve  a design  Rubber design 
And we had a special colour  Suppose yellow is a special colour 

You have pushbuttons and an LCD display 
You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost 

think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition 

Uh we dont really have a extra function with the speech sample 

Because the LCD has more support on customer side 

so I had to take out the special colour I suppose 

and if you want it if you want the custom design  then you can buy the separate covers 

So cant we just basically extend it to thirteen 

uh the project is a nogo if we go over twelve and a half 

we could take out the curve 

I think the colour is more important than the really the curve 

but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers 

Can we then not also uh change the material 
We take plastic for the basic cover

something thats stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the

We can put those to the to the other covers 

Rubber would increase durability

so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half 

and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company

But we can take a risk 

thats not our decision to take 

I think its the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect
and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget 

but the one that g has given us the order to design this 

and then tell them okay  we had to drop this and that  just that you know  It is an still an option  but not for this price 

yeah  its true 

So thats what we gotta go with 

just to get it through final 

I say lose the curve  Oh thats true 

Which would  yeah  turn it into something far more ordinary 

I second that 

So we keep the curve 

And Im in favour of keeping the rubber 

were final on that 

because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has 

we could just discuss how the project went 

I think it was too bad we didnt have the financial info the last time 

Me too  I felt a bit blind throughout the project 

because its good 
I mean its got everything for the for the reasonable price 

lets eval evaluate uh the product of us  our design 

I uh will pre present uh some statements
and we will decided together wha what if its true or false

So so the buttons  the look and feel 

One and a half 

And the next one uh yeah  when its lost uh you can find it 

so I think it thats that deserves a one  Definitely 

And the next one 

Manual 
I think the LCD display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control 

it it is pretty straightforward 

What are we uh displaying on the LCD screen 

Things like brightness and uh those kind of things weve put in the menu 

I thought that people wanted previews on their

I dont think its possible really 

uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example  how do you configure that 

So that could be done by LCD display 

A three 

I mean the shape is trendy 
The the sh the the functions are trendy 
Its just the colours that are not supporting the basic model 

Maybe we should go with a two then 

Overall score 

Two and two thirds 

mostly its its influenced by the fact that we didnt have enough resources to implement speech recognition 
Cause yeah  that gives you a seven 

I do admit that we d did miss a little or didnt sp didnt talk talk enough about the possibility of the LCD display 
We could have used it more efficiently 

like I said  changing channels  everything hidden in your LCD display  so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything 

For example  I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created 

I think we did pretty well as teamwork though 
Because  yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime 

There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them 

I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool 
I think uh s especially for design issues  its very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little its easier to share them 

Although for actual design Id say the response time should be a little bit higher 

The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to further elaborate on that 

The one thing we missed though  we dont have a product name 

And its especially on the triple R thats important  The Real Reaction Remote 

Triple R it is 

have to write my report now  I guess 

Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report 

Yeah  sure 

What do we scrap 

Yeah  I would say I would agree with you on the colour 

So I might make this a two instead of a one  I guess 

You can use the LCD in a good way 

So we cannot work on more than one page at same time  Thats not possible
