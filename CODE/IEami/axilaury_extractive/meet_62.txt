Um alright first off well just uh recap from our last meeting 
Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing 

Um yeah  were gonna hear your uh th three little presentations 

o Id like to hear whos g whos on the um from from uh Catherine actually first 

Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery 
a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches 

You can have a kinetic provision of energy 

Or you can use solar cells 

Well  theres sometimes combinations  I mean  like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power 

but Im not sure about that indoors  really  but

And uh if we want something fancier  I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice 

Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery  really 

For the case of the remotes itself  um they can be a general case  which is just a flat one 
You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one 

Um then the case material itself  so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex  uh rubber  wood  or titanium 
And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium  you cant use it for if you if were choosing a double curved case  we cant choose titanium 

But if were choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything 

So that might be an idea of using the rubber 

And also it doesnt break as easily maybe 

Rubber  were all were all going were all liking that idea 

so you can have basic pushbuttons or a scrollwheels  like you have on a mouse 
um or you could have um LCD  which gives you a display 

Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber pushbuttons 

Mean so whats the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case 

Lets have rubber push buttons  hey 

Um so the pushbuttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be

If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the LCD  the display thing  then thats even more expensive 

is uh  okay  advanced chip on print  which I presume is like one PCB and thats got all the electronics on one board including the um infrared sender 

Well  if if its not chip on print then  I guess  you get different chip components  and you build them separately and doesnt include the infrared 

If its something thats inside the the unit  I it doesnt affects whether the customers gonna buy it or not 

So lets not lets uh not bother with the chip on print 

What about the just developed uh sample sensor 

Well  what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit 

Im just guessing  But its gonna be the most expensive option  probably and

it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the TV on like  turn the TV on  and i turns comes on 

a it just gives you a verbal response 

Oh  then forget about it 

so we want it rub rubber double curved 
So rubber rubber keys  yeah 

But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these antiRSI ps specific

Okay  so Im continuing with the user interface uh topic 

Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products  uh like the coffee machine 

they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an MP three player like iPod 

So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface 
I guess  we we basically vetoed that idea 

but they suggested uh  you know  going i a little bit into a a niche 

but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general  but done well 

I can give you an example here of uh  good layout and bad layout

So this would be an example of bad layout 
where you have volume up and volume down  but they have a V on both of them  so uh

Uh this is the example of the giant remote thats impossible to lose 

Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense 

I didnt I didnt think the spinningwheel or the uh LC display were were crucial for us 

So were were not gonna have any sort of display I think uh 

I think we shall have a limited number of buttons 
ideally  I mean a a power  channel up  channel down  volume up  volume down  and a numerical keypad 

it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that 

Um it seems like we wouldnt wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy 

Yeah  I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere 

I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before 

Well  Im just basically letting you know whats happening in the markets

So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have 

Um second  uh it should be technologically innovative innovative 

now the trouble is is weve already decided that were going with the stuff that works already  thats cheap 

I mean its different  but I wouldnt say like a rubber remote is fancy 

Thats why I was thinking  Bluetooth 

cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays  like it really is 

they dont really care whether  you know  at the end of the day whether it works properly or not 

Of course  they do 

So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other

that would mean youd need a television that has Bluetooth in it  which no no television does 

Well  if youre looking at if you looking at something thats going to be bought by people  you have to make it new  you have to make it state of the art 

Like it doesnt have to be  you know  Bluetooth 

If we want something new  we need to move away from what we already have

Okay  Yeah  this thats thats very good 

Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then 
Its been done for watches  but I havent seen that for remotes  yet 

Yeah  we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator 

Next years fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths  shoes and furniture 

Okay  so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them 

right  were gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing 

and as its rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy 

Yeah  were were ahead of the game there 

and um Im not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though 

Maybe make it like fruity colours or something 

The power button could be like a big apple or something 

Um like Im just thinking bright colours 

Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like

so we could do like the pink range  the blue range  the green range  the

where  you know  you have a variety of colours  that people feel like theyre customising it when they buy it  even  you know  just just by the fact of choosing 

from you Catherine wi your y y you know youre gonna be working on the the look and feel design 
Um Gabriel  youre gonna be working on  you know come up with the the user interface design 
Then basically  you two are gonna be working together on this 

come up ki you know  be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas 

Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay 

Um and youre gonna be working on the product evaluation 

Well look into this lock key
