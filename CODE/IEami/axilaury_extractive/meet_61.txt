so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again 

Okay  right  welcome to meeting B 
Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting  basically 
uh cause I know what Im supposed to be doing now 

and  uh yeah  Im just here to
sort of liaise between the three of you
and get things going  get people talking
and and Im gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically 

what this meeting is all about is um Im gonna have some presentations from all three of you 

Well well uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all 

So I want each of your presentations to not be too long  five five minutes  something like that 

This meeting its not very long  Its uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now 

Um if you havent done a PowerPoint thingy  it doesnt matter 

Im gonna draw it on the board then 

So um the idea is that weve got the
energy source um 

So um I think maybe uh two batteries 

then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal 
which could be uh an infrared signal 
um which will be sent by an electronic chip 

Is a battery like the only way of

No cause like cha cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying 

swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain  but

as far as the infrared signal  do we have control over  you know  how far away you can be from the receiving unit  the the TV  and still have it be operational 

Its never gonna be more than its never gonna be  you kno unless youve got a TV the size of a football pitch  its not doesnt have to go that far 

Well  we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it 

Yeah  yeah I d it sounds like you you w dont wanna overcomplicate things 

How about Bluetooth 

Yeah  and basically uh  as far as methods  I was I was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes  trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there 

And so in the research that I was doing theres basically two types of remotes 

I mean people want a remote thats familiar  that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics  but

Um so things that seem like absolute musthaves uh would be a volume control 

uh channel keys updown 

but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want  rather than doing updown 

ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred 

judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that thats what we were going after 

So  the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality 

so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use 

Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or

No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know 

what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether thats really necessary 

I would say its If its simple to do 

Um Ive had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well  something we should take into account is um weve gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit 
Its gotta d look like its in the R and R 

and what I didnt mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design 

Uh  everything is going t ergonomic  you know 

and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market  I guess  Um 

Well  for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab 

So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly 

Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user 

Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy 

I was thinking something easy to use  especially for older people 
Um has to look really cool  flashy groovy for people to buy it 

and also we asked them whether they wanted whether theyd be interested in um voice activating 

What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost 

most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five 

Its older generation  theyre the ones that have gone out and

but the younger generation who we are catering for  like who have most of the money nowadays  do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote 

Voice activation might not be the best 

I would say scra Id say scrap that straight off 

Um also with um with buttons  a thing called RSI 

we should probably consult with our legal department uh 

Ill see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting 

I think we can do some really in in that department  the the ergonomic department  we can make some some really good improvements 

weve decided that its gonna be  you know uh  were going for a basic television remote 

I think  we should just go with the simplest option on everything 
uh and that would be infrared 
energy source  that would be batteries 

Doesnt have to go through a wall  because youre not gonna be looking through a wall 

Uh mean we we can look into using the s  you know  the little tiny weeny batteries  all like special longlasting batteries  Um 

oh have you guys found out if we can if we can email stuff to each other 

Can you all d email me your email addresses 

So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as

I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background 

Well  its like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders 

Cant we have different colours in the remotes 

And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups 
so  I mean  we are sort of beholden to them 

So we have to have it one colour 

Not one colour  but the pattern needs to be recognisable 

but you have to look at the product and instantly know that its one of our products

so maybe  so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein  perhaps 

But it could come in different colours and have the RR colours just somewhere

And um  I think we uh stop for lunch now
