Were here to have a kickoff meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control 

and we speak about this tool were going to design and try to make a project plan 

Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh its functional design  its conceptual design  and desail detailed design 
and for that were going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day 
Um  so lets try the whiteboard 
Um so any of you who want to go 

Its gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw 

Lets talk about money 

So  Twenty five Euro for a remote control 

On the international market 

Yeah  were to sell two million then 

Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum 

So any of you have experience in remote controls 

So that could be a great um application 
Remote controls children proof 

but mainly it has to be very robust

colourful  maybe

No  thats a good idea 

Yeah even we can change colours  no 

like the phones and these things we c yeah 

And it should be really small and 

Small also 

Should it be  y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control

at least it should hold in your hand n properly  like 

Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame 

I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it theyre they never find a good button in the right place 

no screens  its too complex 

Mm  So  some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what

Too expensive for twelve Euro 

Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working 

and if Im lefthander I use this switch to follow the main operations 

may need more than three mm three button  three mm possibilities  ye yeah 

But for standard actions you usually what do you do  you change channels  you adjust volume  and nothing else 

but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five 

But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah  you can only have one bit 

And then back to the one I was before 

yeah  that would be cool 

Go back button is good 

Um were going to meet again in thirty minutes
and uh I want you to mm work on these ideas
and try to make a uh the ones  make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we dont want 
And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do 

So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes 

So what does ME means 

Market Expert 

Uh thats me 

the user requirement specifications
