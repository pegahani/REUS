Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting 

Im project manager but on the meetings Im also the secretary 
which means I will make uh minutes

Um if Im right  there are three presentations 

And um we will also take a look at new project requirements  um if you havent heard about them yet 

Um well I dont know who wants to go first with his presentation 

Ill go first  Okay  Ill go first yeah 

I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control 

Uh when you press a button  uh thats when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume  um a little connection is made

on a little print plate

Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal
which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors

And that makes uh the the infrared lights signal
which is sent to the television set 

Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls  are that uh they are very easy to produce 

uh its possible to uh make them in mass production

Uh and the technologys already available 

Uh I made a little uh uh animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works 

the subcomponent  I suppose that you understand what a subcomponent is  is f in this example its the button 
Uh when it is pressed down  um  the switch is ter is uh is switched on 
so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh cooperation with the battery of course 

Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control 
Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held 

Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours  and uh easy to use buttons 

Perhaps soft touch  uh touch screen uh buttons
because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged 
uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore 
And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs 

and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote 
Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls  of how they uh they look  and information from the web that I found 
Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set 

adjust volume  that kind of thing 

There are some uh examples of remote controls 
You can see they are very different 
The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera 
And the other is uh more user friendly  little with big buttons 

Um I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach 

A lot of buttons they may think from I dont need s as much as that 

personal preferences is is uh a simple remote  with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use 

And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance 
If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video  it could also work with uh with the stereo 

you could reuse the buttons

And it should be a user friendly  clear buttons  and not too much 

Were going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote 

that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control 

The methods I I prefer is were going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more 

Younger people  from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like LCD screens  speech recognition e etcetera 
And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age 
The elderly people  from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features 
and we possess less than two third  thats two fifth  of the market share in that area 

Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often 
So we dont have to make it very small  like uh like a mobile phone or something 

Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly 
and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot 
so the buttons sh should be that small 
or shouldnt be that complex

Remote control has to have to have a low power usage 
because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour 

The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control 
so those they those have to h be find very easily 

Buttons  Like what all colleagues said  have to have to be minimalized 

or in LCD screen 

because we have the LCD screen  we have the various options 

but an LCD screen  the problem with the L sc LCD screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years dont use the LCD screen a lot 
So we have to that keep that in mind that if youre going to implement LCD screen  you dont have to make it that hard to learn or to use 

The last but not least  younger people are more critical about the features 

And the older people spend more money  and easily on a remote control 

Because they use the remote control often more often 
and are more technical than the ol older people 

So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people 
but also somewhat on the elderly people 

but like I said  LCD screen is easily to use

And it should be easy to use  Especially the volume buttons  the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels 

I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements 

then I think its a good thing that I made a separate slide of them

Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet 
So thats uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext 
Uh the remote control should only be used for the television 
otherwise the project becomes more complex 

Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus 
and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty 

And uh a last point  but also very important  our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products 
which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design 

according to our agenda its then time to take a decision on the remote control functions 

you said it should only uh work with one appliance 

Yeah  Only be used for television 

Then it should have uh on  off 

Standby options 

the basics then by a volume  channel  one till two zero numbers on it 

A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers 

because some TVs  if you press the t one and then the two  it be between five secs it make twelve 

I think its easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that 

and thats thats not relaxed

But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get

new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty 

Uh younger people have now  sixteen till to twenty five age  are f eighty one percent interested in LCD screen 

But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap 

A touch screen uh probably uh even more 

perhaps we should we should focus on that LCD screen 

you dont know how much it costs  the LCD screen 

I dont have any costs here 

But if you would do an LCD screen do we have don dont you have any buttons 

for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons  such as channel and volume  you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen
and its possible to p uh press them down  just like a touch screen 

were going for an LCD screen 

I think its the most easier thing 

but also on the older 

But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people 

and will they use it if it only has an LCD screen 

But our our our whats it  project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets  to customers that are younger than forty 

but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger 

if it costs gets too much  too expensive  then yeah  we should be sticking to rubber buttons 

I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of LCD uh screens 

if you uh you receive an email about that  uh can you post it in the

But for now its LCD  Okay 

itll look fancy with LCD screen  Yeah 

They think its ugly  When it has an LCD screen 

Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time  to get all the fingerprints off it 

what else does our remote need 

A mute button 

The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection  volume con selection 
and power s power usage 
And a teletext  but that is not of the question 

But shouldnt you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it 

and we could make an a a separate menu on the LCD uh screen for teletext 

And other other less important things are screen settings  audio settings  and channel settings 

they are less important 
but I think they should be there 

but in a sub submenu or something like that 
Uh I think its also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English  uh  to not use batteries 

Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off 

power supply is one of the most important things 

If you have an LCD screen thats burns all the time I dunno 

because I dont think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it 
so I think its better when th the TV shuts down  the remote shuts down 

And go to standby mode when you dont use it 

And maybe a low battery indicator  On the screen 

of put it in a recharger  Charger 

So we are going for the for the recharger 

I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days 

uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when youre done watching television 
thats also a a a great advantage
because you cant lose it anymore 

But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch
because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the TV 

just a cable  or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on  Something like that 

Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen 
so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points

I think that this should be standard  Large button large buttons 

And you said something about speech recognition 

also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five  twenty six to thirty five years  seventy six percent  and thirty six to forty five  thirty five percent 

twelve fifty  twelve fifty 

I know lets do a speech 

But they want to talk into the remo remote control  or something 

I think an LCD screen should be suf sufficient 

But when you look at the percentages

but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh 

I think I think its better to have L LCD screen 

But would it be useful to imple implement both 

Yeah  if the costs al allow it 

but how would you like to implement that 
that you say volume up  and then it goes up 

Certain systems already exist  I think 

Then you also have to have different languages if we go international 

But that should also be with f should be also with LCD screen 

you can use icons

it should be done  If it could be done  should be done 

so we only do this when we have enough money left 

Ive written down an an on or off button  volume selection  channel selection  uh the digits from one to zero  huh  Um or from zero to nine  Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits  mute button  a separate menu for teletext  a battery indicator 

And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons

You also now have colours 

Curved 

we could also implement a audio settings  screen settings and channel settings  but as submenus 

so not too much teletext support  but in a separate menu 

We could check the other remote controls with technical functions 

Arent we forgetting something very important 

wide screen  high screen  different things you have 

it should be available  but then in separate screen settings or something 

Channel settings 

Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote  an expanded version 

and the buttons  should they have colours 

Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the LCD screen 

Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts  like with the telephones 

make it available in different colours  you mean 

signal for las final five minutes 

were having a a general menu with the most used functions  uh teletext  screen settings  audio settings  channel settings 

Or do we have any buttons  On the remote 

you only have channel button or volume button 

So we dont have any normal buttons

But thats also in the LCD 

Maybe only the on and o on and off button 

But isnt idea to use uh uh what you said  uh normal on and off button for the TV 

But a not as normal button  in the LCD 

maybe there should be a separate button apart from the LCD 

There has to be a on button on the remote 

B No
you just tap I think 

because uh when you touch the LCD screen when it is in standby mode  it should pop on 

I guess if you use the LCD screen  you first have to search where is the on button 

But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote  then you do the on 

I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you dont have any buttons on the s on on remote control 

So actually were going to create a a buttonless uh remote  No buttons at all 

thats might be a unique selling point  huh for a remote 

postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting 

for now  were having a lunch break 
and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work 
I will uh write uh minutes  if I can create them out of this 
And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder 
And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles 
And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach
