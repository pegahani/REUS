Welcome to the meeting everyone 

This is the first meeting uh for developing our  our new product 
Im Heather  Im your Project Manager 

If everyone could go around and explain their role and um  and their name 

My names Poppy 
Im the Industrial Designer for this project 

My names Tara and Im the User Interface Designer 
I will also be responsible for the functional design phase  the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design 

Im Genevieve 
Im the Marketing Expert 

And uh tool training is one thing that were going to be doing today 
um um as well as planning the project 

as a team were going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control 
Um  we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy 
um  a completely new style  so that  um  can really appeal to a  to a generation that doesnt want a simple plain kind of  uh  channelchanger 
And  um  it needs to be userfriendly for  um  maybe  for an example  for people that  um  cant see the numbers as well 

Yes  its a television remote control 

I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now 

and then  um  after weve brainstormed and  and thought about  we can come together in a meeting and  and discuss what  what um  what kind of functional design we want to use 
Same with conceptual design and detailed design 

And  um  as a sort of teambuilding moment  um  I  Id like us to  um  try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal 

My favourite animal  which changes all the time  okay 
right now it is an elk 

Im gonna take minutes
while  um  you guys express your favourite animals 

like all sorts of animals  but for the moment Im gonna draw a cat  in memory of my poor cat that died recently 

and it  it is my favourite animal right now  cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature 

But I like cats because theyre so independent 

I think my favourite animal would be a dog 

 Um  I like dogs because  um  theyre so good to humans 

Im going to draw a butterfly 
because I saw a butterfly yesterday  that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving 

So  now that we know how to use the whiteboard 
um  the next  um  thing we need to address is our financial department  to meet our our budget 

um  wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros 

we can like the price to create it will be significantly less 

Um  we want it to cost  uh  absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents 

so well have a hundred percent profit then 

So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas  any um suggestions that you may have so far 

I find that in the dark its often hard to know what button youre pushing 

Um  wed like to  um to  uh  make fifty million Euro 

Um  and make it for an international market 

I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing 

tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was 

So maybe if you could have some kind of

Theres some remote controls where theres kind of a hidden panel  so all those buttons that you dont really use unless youre programming or something 

Do yous not find that  um  like  theres a lot of  um  buttons on your remote control  and you dont know what half of them do 

Are we going into kind of novelty factors here 

I suppose  if were he heading to have it  like make a huge profit out of this  it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing 

And the key issue here is  is being trendy and original 

Um  like you can go over your ideas  of course  in your own personal times 
Um  our next meeting will be in half an hour
