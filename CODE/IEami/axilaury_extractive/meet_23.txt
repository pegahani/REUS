Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept
and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be 

we will have again three presentation  from all of you 
and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions 

Okay  Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results weve had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world  Um

so f from our market research basically weve come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel  um as opposed to a functional look and feel  is our number one priority 

Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative 

Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well 

From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan  um weve discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes  shoes and furniture 

And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy 

I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature 

Okay  So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use 

Um generally  generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something  in my opinion  uh the first feature is just to be easy to use 
So  the more frequent buttons should be larger 
they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control 
And uh s uh I can conclude like this  that we shouldnt need to learn how to use it 

Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand 

And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesnt like to buy lots of battery  it should not uh consume lots of energy 

so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels 

Uh  And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier 

And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good 

but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy 

that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers

seven seven inch T TFT screen 
which is good news for us  since we wanted to include a display there 

So there will be some circuit uh for the power 

Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries

And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there  we must use additional source of energy 
which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything 

Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres 

And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone  which is somewhere 

Can you fit any uh for example a TFT or any electronic device in a spongy thing  or is there any problem for that 

A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape  basically 

Well  sponginess  Maybe it a good feature  since it takes if its around the TFT then its good  because its just keeps it safe 

Well maybe it can have two shells  a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside 

Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around 

Uh uh have we decided that were gonna use this TFT screen 

how big is it in reality 

Usually when they say seven inch I think its the diagonal 

But I I think we can we can cut it 

So so for the same price we have four screens now 

Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something 

Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still

Yeah  but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that  you know 

I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something 

so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions 
Uh first I think energy its a key problem

If we use the batteries  and the additional so solar cell  then its okay for L uh speech recognition and LCD 
so no problem in energy  I think 

So if we use s solar cells  um where is the sun if someones watching TV inside 

I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large 

Could you re could you redesign your board 

Ive I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller LCD  if its possible 

Okay  so five to ten  I I think its its feasible 

So using some LCDs we can touch  so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh  I dunno the name  LCD responding to fingers 

So lets go for a small LCD 

My first idea is because our colour is more yellow  and the it should be easy to take in a hand  I thought about banana  or something like that  which is fruits  and

Well its its definitely the obvious choice  with the colour of our company 

I dunno if it can fit with the technology 

The screen has to be square 

But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches  so 

So we are agree with the banana thing 

Its like more more expensive to have shape like that 

I think thats more important than saving a bit of money on on the TFT screen 

So  the last point we decided its infrared  I guess 

should should discover the other buttons  which are hidden 

Yeah  peeling of the banana 

Is it is it possible to do that 

I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then its easy to make that 

If you see its like peeling  You open a plastic cover and you see some USB interfaces  some some interfaces for adaptor 

it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border  so its it sticks like refrigerator door  completely 

And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean 
Mm  Likes  Soft plastic  or

So we add also the speech recognition device 

Um  so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design 
The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device 
And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation 

uh I think you should work together  s you uh Hamed and Peter  to work uh in a in a first prototype
