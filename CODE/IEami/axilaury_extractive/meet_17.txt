So  were here today to to have our first kickoff meeting about uh this new project were going to tak to talk about in a few minutes 
Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager 

Im uh Michael  Im the user interface designer 

Hi Im Guillermo  Im the Marketing Expert 

And I am Hemant  the industrial designer 

Um so lets have a look to the the agenda 

uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here 
Um then well go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it 
So  the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control 
Um it should be original  trendy  and also user friendly 
As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company 
It is in three step as you know 
First the functional design 
The seconds a conceptual design 
and then the detailed design 
During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately  individually on uh your specific tasks
and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what youve youve you did and what uh we will do next 

so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings 

Okay so  want me to draw my favourite animal 

Well  I dont really have a favourite animal  but um

Im gonna about the uh spider

I dunno why  but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther

So  not the favourite animal  but I think Ill draw elephant 

Do we have some message there 

I have to catch you 

We have to to go through the meeting 

We can discuss that offline 

so another important part of the project is about money 

So we should target selling price of twentyfive Euro for this remote control

which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros  okay 
And we should target the inter an international market 

is this a standalone unit that were gonna be selling 

So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go 

should it be um specific remote control to some specific device 
Should it be a universal one 

so  it seems the the first thing that theyve kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make 

but I guess if thats if thats the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket

So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go 

So we need to close the meeting 

So um you have to work on the on the working design 
you have to uh work on the technical functions 
and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs 

Um you will receive some information by emails  i as usual
