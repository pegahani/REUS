So we come to the third meetings 

Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design
and now we will talk about the conceptual design 
So we will talk about some specific details 

Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept

the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department
and have which components was uh available to build a remote control 
So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy  hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy 
We also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control 

we didnt decide yet which kind of battery we will put inside the the remote 
So uh its a point to discuss 

Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated 
but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so 
And uh this is the last point  the choice of chips 
So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy
because I think solar energy wi wont work in a cluttered uh uh environment 

For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice
because its trendy

For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons  simple buttons

What is this single curved

Well uh uh i i its uh its the the shape of the um of the remote 
You you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the

Its more confog f comfortable that if these uh its completely flat 

And the battery  is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesnt matter 

Yeah the um thats the point 
The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um

and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy 
But I d I dont know its if it is feasible
because I dont know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy 

We we might check with our R and D department to see if they have this product ready for market 

So I um keep in touch with the R and D department 

So the titanium case is the normal case that
Ill show you some pictures that I have
and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not 
Cause I am not very sure  plastic  titanium or whatever 
Theres another point I want to make 
is that the uh well youve seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some why buttons are not the mm not the only ways you can use

So the user interface is uh i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system 

we can uh see in our uh R and D uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy 

a programme which can be seen or heard or otherwise perceived by the human user
and the commands and mechanism the user uses to control its operation and input data 

we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here 
The idea is to represent buttons as figures  diagrams  symbols and on
so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing 

A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures 

So the here are some examples 
So they cluster the buttons together 
They group them into col they colour them
and uh they have different forms as well 

but this interface are kind of confusing 
Uh basically there are too many buttons 

So some people are propose voice recognition

ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company
when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine
and the machine are reply to you 

And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used
so we might consider that  supposedly 

Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the LC display
so instead of using the mm buttons you have a LCD screen
and then there you can u you can use that as buttons 

Touch screen  I mean 

And some people propose a scroll button  Integrated with push buttons
or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button 

so there are a few aspects that I collected here 
So s basically this deals with special users  children  handicapped people  old people 

basically they are programmable 

And then they also secure uh covers  to protect
uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings 

But we dont have to integrate all these complicated features 
Im just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people 

And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover 
Mm maybe useful for children 

And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside 
So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside 

this is another company that provides big buttons 

I see that that is useful for old people

But for our product we dont need a big one
because you have voice recognition e eventually with use 

We should include speech synthesis in this case  no 

but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control 

And uh  this is another one

the the the part thats a V standing for the volume 
So theres a up arrow and a down arrow 
But you the see that in the V  the V appears to be the down arrow on the top

so its confusing interface 

And here are is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found 
Big buttons are convenient 
voice recognition helps 
push buttons  scroll buttons  spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools 
And uh user customisable is important
and finally simplicity simplicity is the key 

we have many concepts there
but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used 

Well I I think you its its its fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities
but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the TV screen I dont think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote
since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that 
because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also  so 

Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control
and we should have just a button like help
and you say uh and you ik you press the button help

Yeah  Thats a good idea 

So you are display on the screen 

On the TV screen the uh how to use your remote 

So that eliminates all the complicated documentation 

But people are often enough looking at the help 
once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff 

In the case where they need help  in the case where they need help 

And let us see what the market demands 

Its just for user customizable  for kids or old people 

I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids

Can be used by both kids and old people 

Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller  i it could be a cube 
is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube
and maybe you can just change the um the buttons 
if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons 
you turn the other side you get the other buttons 

So we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes
and how it could be special from the other remotes 
And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires 

So seventy percent of the users  they find their remote controls very ugly 
they dont find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything 
And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money if the remote control would look fancy 
And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user 
And seventy five percent of the users said they zap a lot 
And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons 
so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons theyre not used most of the times 

And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls 

fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room

And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it 

fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes
and thirty four percent they say that its quite difficult to learn if its too complex 
So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them 
We should have an LCD on the rem remote control 

Well mm w well I I I dont really see the advantage of having uh LCD on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen 

yeah of course its fancy trendy and so on

I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy 
So if we have a LCD on the remote  rather than looking onto the TV you just look into a remote and navigate it 
Its the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control 

Yeah but when you play with the iPod you dont have a big screen in front of you  s

You can use this screen instead of the big se screen 

If you reuse the existing screen  we element eliminate the LCD 

and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful  fancy 

well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look

on the speech recognition if the technology is available
but well I think LCD will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results 

so the thing is you can find out how much an LCD will cost

I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers 
And its always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls 

And also the cost for the speech recognition 
Ask our R and D department 

Yeah its o only for a limited vocabulary 
say eighty commands or so 

And also the scroller button  how much will it cost 

Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button 

from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button 
Because they they just theyre just frightened to use the scrollings or help button 

Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button
so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality 

Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others 

But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the TV screen I think that just five buttons are sufficient 
one to go up left right down and uh enter
and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that 

Or it could be like this  as the people say  if they have a LCD on the remote not on the television 
Because when you have the LCD onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background 

So if you have then LCD in the remote  you just have a menu 

and this menu when you press the menu  in the LCD displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume  then the program  then the brightness  contrast and all the stuff 

And I think its increases the cost of the the remote control if you use LCD  I

because if there are few buttons  you dont have to look at your your controller any more

I think that theres no contradiction here 

so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness
and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button

if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel 

so finally that wil eliminates the the need for LCD 

And the third problem was to find the remote control 

But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the TV screen

But they are just less used compar

It doesnt mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important 

and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate

Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find

You will listen to a peep  special peep 

thats exactly what I mean by voice commander 

uh its always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control 

and whenever we dont use the remote control we put it in the charger 

so we have some one charger there

And when were using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere  in the charger we have a small button  and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps  wherever it is 

And thats a good idea 

I mean it doe it also doesnt require a voice command 
because there are problems with a voice command 

I mean charger would be fixed
because its always with electricity plugged 

what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off TV button  the off button  the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen  please charge charge me 

because uh every time youre off the computer the TV you are asked the the command the TV com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger 

You never get it lost

And of course the final point is a fancy look 
As we have seen earlier the remotes which were displayed by Norman they werent fancy 
I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons 

But you can have an button for child lock 

I mean uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if its like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it  you cant avoid him 

So just by pressing the button with some code  you t you put a lock onto the remote  so that he cant use even

Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the TV you can uh well write a code or choose a category  if it is kids  uh things like that 

Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids

I think these other four points theyre the market demands
and so its for the user interface design and industrial design to just think

So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use  where to use  and s uh and so on 

I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser

Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included 

because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by TV programs  you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them 

and you can say to your remote control like uh sports
and then on the TV you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now

we have a problem there 
You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something  and if the score comes twenty four thirty five  youve just say twenty five
and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five 

Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the TV so 

So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers

Ordinary twenty five you almost theres a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent
and TV twenty five I dunno it will be round about one or two percent 

But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers 

That will be too big 
And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also 

Check with the v R and D department the capability of recogniser 

It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel 

but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary 

Als might be you just forgot the channel name  you kno only know the number 

Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary 

I think theres another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example  then what you can do is that the you can make the TV screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel 

you just use the control button uh 
you just you you just choose the the option you want

Or lets the user create his own vocabulary of channel 

Just you have uh in the beginning you have uh t you have to train

the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two 

if if there is uh more than one person who is watching TV

If we are using the television in the different environments  say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work  that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company 
So I think we should specify some prerequirements if we want to use a voice commands 

Or we can switch on or switch off the the special  yeah 

well I think thats a good uh a good option
because its simple and uh simple to implement also  so 

Maybe well discuss them in next meeting 

I think these are the practical problems 
So we need to take care of them in the design 

Its time to close this meeting
