this is the beginning of the third meeting  the conceptual design meeting 
Um our agenda should be um that were opening the meeting 

the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point 
Um and we should each have a presentation to make 
Um we have certain decisions to make

Um there are the decisions we have to turn to 
but well come back to them in a minute
after I take us to the minutes of the previous meeting 

Um Sarah  you presented a marketing research report
um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be handheld  power  channel  volume  number keys  possibly a speech recognition 
And then Steph did a second presentation
um that those functions plus streamlining them with big userfriendly keys that were easy to use 

Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard
um that it should be a simple massproduced device  because of the twelve and a half Pence cost 
Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries
and having a docking place as a selling point 

we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense  that were decision makers 
Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the TV 

Um and that the function we agreed was volume  power  numbers  enter  channels  a way to move between channels  easy to use and handheld 
Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition  what what do the current ones sell for 
Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics 
Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed 

first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up 
which was uh current cost of the competition devices 

and and theyre uh twenty to sixty Euros  depending on uh branding 

But I think that with the current um price that were searching for  were well within  even on the lower end  of the uh of the market 

I investigated the remote control market in greater detail 
and my uh the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch 

Whats hot 
fruit and veg  Spongy 
And this is all over the catwalks  Paris  Milan  and Im talking about clothing  furniture  shoes 
This is really interesting change from past years 
because it is much more organic 

And I think if were to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control  we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset 

on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing 

Functional is out 

Fancy 

And f the fancy  and thats exactly the term  Im Im thinking polished  elegant  you know  kind of innovative  but a cut above 
This is twice as important as the next finding 
which is technologically innovative 
This is interesting 
cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important 
but maybe whats innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh  you know  designed in interesting substances 
Ease of use  Again  pretty low 
I mean its the top three 
but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important 

I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves 

It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote  you know  your t your cell phone 

I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned  you know  so  you know  something similar to a summer dress  you know  it would have like fruit and veg  is that we actually make these spongy 

initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh handheld  so banana  pineapple and pear 

They could be interchangeable 
theyre spongy 

So what were talking about is changing  this concept 
Everyone has a TV remote 

but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising  Im thinking the teenager  the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers 

So I really open this up to uh any other feedback  This spongy fruit and veg 

I I think were gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this 
Spongy is gonna be difficult  Im afraid 

And as for as for um well budgeting as well  if were gonna have lots of different interchangeable components 

we can make these things out of wood  titanium  plastic or rubber 
I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy 

I was thinking titanium myself 

I have been influenced by pictures of iPods 

I think many of us would associate those with fancy 

it would be uh a a very simple product
that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable  So

Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management

W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit 

I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next 

I was really thinking a lot about the I uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone 

youre gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you 

Ive been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate 
and Ive had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division 
who have told me whats actually available  you know  what the current state of the art in components is  and some of the exciting new things theyve got 

this is the innards of a remote control um 

and thats the the back of the interface 
And this is a pushbutton one 
so you see these little little buttons here  theyre little rubber rubber buttons
that go through onto the the board at the back
and they push these buttons here 

thats the basic construction that weve got to got to accommodate 
We got to have something that pushes the little buttons
that um talk to the chip
that encodes the message
that sends the the message to the receiver 

So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities weve got for the energy source 
Um we can have your bog standard double double A batteries in a replaceable um little compartment 
We can have a hand

a windup  yeah 

but i it maybe is doesnt quite go with the um the fruit and veg 
Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source 
where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device 

Or we we had talked about solar power 
but I thing that we agreed that thats not so good in the dark 

Im afraid this is the options weve got on on the case 
It can be made of plastic  rubber  wood o if you like  or titanium 
Um and the nearest weve got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber 

and basically it can have a flat surface  a curved surface or a double curved surface 
but I think if we wanna use standard components  were gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that 

push button  thats thats the one were all familiar with 

what does the interface look like 

Um we can have scroll buttons
and the the scroll button can incorporate a push 
so you can have it like on a mouse
where you can use it to go up and down  change volume or channel or something like that
and push to select something 
Um you can have multiple scroll buttons 

And we can also incorporate an LCD display in the remote 
but this will increase the cost 
Um the electronics that actually makes the device work  weve basically got three  simple  regular  advanced 

If we want the nice cheap one  the simple  then we can only have push buttons 

Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons 

And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices 

I dont know what that is 
but I think they think its quite important

I I think weve got two options 
We can either go for a really cheap model 
keep all of the costs down 

Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer 
I think it  um wont necessarily l uh look like a pineapple 

Um but it could have an LCD screen
and it could have multiple scroll buttons 

Um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty 

and it could have the the companys new development of the um sample sensor and speaker 

Im afraid I dont have that information available 
Um manufacturing didnt actually give attach any prices to any of this  Im afraid 

so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it 

I I dont know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company 

Thats before I heard about all this hot tips about the future  fruitwise 

We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one 
which would allow um say a banana 
but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that  we have to have a push button as the interface 

I dont actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says 
just that my method was to look at the  well  my my inspirations 
which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing  including MP three players  uh like you know  hifi remotes  not just television and these things 
Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones 

Uh Ive been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel 

um what functions we actually need 

It has uh scroll wheels without without a display 

but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right 

So I was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um
and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen 

and it comes up with whats showing on that channel at the moment 

you can scroll along

and you can see whats on the other channels while youre watching the same channel on the screen 
Uh but Im also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote 
um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice  big  easy buttons to press 
but still quite simple and quite cost effective 

what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple  uh not fancy but not totally minimalist  I mean just pretty simple plastic  probably 
I was thinking  yellow and black 
just because thats the companys colours 
with very very few buttons  but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen  like  you know  just small along the bottom

Yeah  Id Id certainly support that idea 

And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber 
I mean titanium would be great 
but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey 

we cant for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately 

But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one 
And I quite like it 
cause its just smooth and handheld
and its got these easily reachable buttons

so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle  Up  down  left  right 

Do you want scroll buttons in that as well 

I I was thinking not actually scroll  like a like mouse scroll 

like this s style thing where you c have up  down  left and right  And enter in the middle 

and when when you click on each one  it you can go into a new menu for that 

It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic 

Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention

Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components  um the materials  things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things 

If were k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic  then I think titaniums too futuristic 

Whereas a plastics so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else 

And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea 

I think I think thats a g nice clean design 

But they all have this this feature of this uh Its not quite a scroll wheel  but its a kind of selection in this circle 

But we can implement it with simple push buttons 

either a channel up and down  volume up and down  next appearing programmes up and down  uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen  its got your things like settings and contrast up and down 
So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle 

Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour  And have it abstract 

we could call like a fruit name 

Mm  We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if youd rather if you feel if you like the spongy

Im thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the design constraints are so

This is actually the volume up and down 
but they both say V on them 

so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these 

But we wouldnt have a specific volume up and down 

If were having the scroll wheel  then its gonna double up as all the other up and down functions 

They want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use 
which the choices that weve discussed were pretty much battery  kinetic or solar 

You were saying that the kinetic would be useful 

um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries  Um
or solar that youd have difficulty with it if its a dark day  that itll die on you  and no way to do it 

unfortunately I dont have costing information 
I i in terms of workability  I I think the the two frontrunners are the standard battery or the kinetic 

Whats the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic 

Ive used kinetic in terms of watches

you dont even notice um that its there 

Ive never come across it before 
but it sounds fantastic 

it would make the whole thing a lot lighter  more convenient 

a good selling point 

So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if its at all possible 

But it does depend how much I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs 

Mm 

Um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision 

Um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique
um and I would certainly recommend it  I think 

Um what about the case 
I think theyre talking there about do we want wood  plastic  titanium or rubber 

Do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside  and then a kind of spongy Yeah  s thick spongy cover 

and I think weve discussed not having titanium 

Um weve sort of eliminated wood 
We said plastic or rubber 

Id Id need to talk to manufacturing again about whether thats actually possible 
but I agree  its uh sounds like a nice idea if it is 

Um the next part they want is the user interface concept 

Then Ill just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that 

like four buttons  up  down  left and right with enter in the middle  that will correspond to a menu on the screen 

Id like push buttons with

but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes 

Um this is gonna sound weird 

And they actually want a look and feel design  user interface design 

Marketing they want product evaluation 

Um the look and feel design is for Kate 
uh Steph gets the user interface design 

Um the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype 

you get product evaluation 

Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way 

And thats the end of this meeting
