Okay  welcome to the detailed design meeting 

Oh  were gonna have a prototype presentation first 

Kay  weve made a prototype 

especially we looked at the form  material and the colour 

The logo is uh is uh is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control 

I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious 

Uh the volume uh uh at the side  and the other side is the programmes 
And then we had uh just uh two buttons  we place them in the middle  uh the menu  and for the teletext

Uh then the the the nine uh channels 

Uh  power button 

did we want to have a m mute button 

Alright  and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button 
Yeah  but you you gotta make it clear on the on

Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually 

Uh  there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like
uh d I call it teens and twenties 

All n no  thats um kinda dependent on the television 

but do we have do we need extra buttons 

I think you should add
A cross  or whatever  Yeah  line 

Yeah  but you dont you dont actually need them 
becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first  then you have a couple of seconds

No  thats dependent on the television 

I know some remote controls that dont have these buttons  but you still can  know  obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten 

Yes  but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television 

when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash  its the same thing as when you just push the one 

some televisions dont accept uh that that

When you push the button  the remote control gives a signal 

and when y whe when you dont push another button on the remote control within five seconds  then the remote control gives a signal for channel one 

it it it works uh if you havent got uh a special button for it  uh if you push a one  then on your television there will appear a one and a a line  which is an empty space 

Yeah  but its exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button 

Yes  but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button  uh then you go to a a next level  you can push two buttons 

Yeah  but you dont underst uh you dont understand my point 

that special but button youre talking about  eh 
Thats just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv TV that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash  which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it 
When you dont have that separate button  and you push y one  its exactly the same thing 

No  s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c

Thats the same thing as the button with the one and it

Its simply not true  Its simply not true 

I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied  only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash  but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesnt sport these buttons  it still works 

Well discuss them in the usability lab 

well apply them then for now 

I dont know uh I dont know if if its its necessary 

Yeah  app just apply them next to the zero  the one and the two 

but I still think i it it all TVs in some ways support it 

I think its more c is m maybe we dont uh we both dont really understand how it i how it really works 
but I think theres more to in than wha than what you just said 

No  you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals 

I think its pretty basic 

theres one theres one button 

But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell 
because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls 
So maybe we can uh use the docking station  for example  uh MP three players or or uh

I think thats very difficult  because of different shapes of uh uh devices 

Yes  but when you put that same volt voltages on it  you can put uh
when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it  when its o the same as the other products  you can put it all on the same uh

The technology and the voltage can be the same  Thats uh thats true 

When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out  we can place all on top of it 

Shouldnt it fall then  It isnt going to fall down 

No  when you make it large enough no it it will not 

But its just an idea 

Its leaning  Its leaning backwards  I think  in the in the docking station 

Uh  you could make like a hole in it  you know  of uh in in the

Well lets ha lets talk about the docking station later 
because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway  because we have some uh cost issues still to come 

the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control 
because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area 
Then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button 
which is the most common used uh function 

Yes  uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber 
and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material  a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it 
Yes  we can make also n neon lights on it  or or the buttons that can make uh light on it 

because were gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber 

Then were gonna do the buttons in the i are were gonna have rubber buttons 

Uh  in the same colour as the side 

But uh  and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours 

Right  were gonna evaluate that design according to a few points 
Um  we g the four of us are going to do that um together 

we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design 

The remote control is not ugly  How do you feel 

Yeah  maybe it really depends on taste 

I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side  because you can uh make it in your own

No  not not fronts  but different designs 

Okay  three 

The remote controls uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy 

Yeah well  let that lets make that a one 

Its something we really put work into 

The remote control the remote controls relevant buttons are prominently visible 

Yeah  but we d we didnt were were not planning to use fronts  I believe 

I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant 

The remote control hasnt got too much redundant or unneeded buttons 
I think we totally succeeded there 

Well maybe a two  because of the menu button or something 

Also  the the the buttons of the one  the two  the the digits 

The remote control has got a really trendy look 

Yeah  uh a t I think a two 

weve tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever 

But I do think that its more trendy than beautiful 

You agree on the two 

Remote control has got innovative technology implanted 

No  not LCD  so 

you mean the rubber stuff 

But that thats not innovative 

Or seven maybe  yeah 

With the lights it its its kind of future

Yes  The docking station is a is a little bit innovative 

Well  lets leave it open for uh for us later to see what  because we have to reevaluate anyway 

No uh  well  the agenda says evaluate now  so I think we

how would you innovate a remote control more 

Yeah  more through uh like function TV functionalities and

But I d I definitely dont think its a five 

think about it la later on

Remote control is easy to use 

Yeah  a two 

It will be bought by people under the age of forty 

Yeah  Definitely 

Yeah  a two 

The remote control has recognisable corporate image  colour  logo or slogan 

Yeah  you can put that on the side if if we would like to 
Yeah  and I will I th still think its gonna be a two or a three 

Remote controls got a basic design intended uh for novice users 

Yeah  make it a two 

which is uh quite a great score 

Its a two point six 

Is there something after this uh meeting  Or

Well  I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire 

I received uh a spreadsheet 

Im gonna open the spreadsheet and were gonna work this out together 

First of all  the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list 

We include one battery 

we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component  how much we need of them 

we should know how many simple chips  regular chips

The simple chip is e enough I I think 

I havent got an idea on on which we need to use  really 

The the email I got said uh simple chip  but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device  it will uh cost a a bit more  like I think the advanced chip maybe 

Maybe you can uh look it up right now 

well  point out the advanced chip for now  I guess 

Yeah  but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems 

Okay  we went for the doublecurved case
made out of plastic and rubber  And with a special colour 

Otherwise  you get uh a standard uh plastic colour 

Yeah  I think we uh we have special colours 
Okay  then the pushbutton  I was just counting them 
Uh  I think you have to indicate the amount of pushbuttons we want to use 

Well thats bit of a problem 
because I re but I really dont understand that  because I can imagine a remote control with far more pushbuttons  and it wouldnt be possible according to this uh sheet 

its only uh when you use pushbuttons  it will cost that much 

Maybe its the kind of pushbuttons 
You can have f four kind of pushbuttons 

And plus these two  f uh plus the mute button  and its will be uh eighteen 

Why is that so uh expensive 

Yeah  I dont understand 

Well  okay  well well lets make it just one 

I I I couldnt understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button  Really 

Ive seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah  only with uh page up  page down and volume 

Yeah  but I d I wouldnt want to own that  Really 

Uh  its its still for little children 

But then still  when we theres no room for a docking station or something 

Well give the buttons special colour 
Well give them a special form 

A special colour  why a special colour 

Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings 

I dont think the special form is really true 

I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here  because thats what we were planning to do 

Kay  but the problem now is that the Theres no such thing as a docking station in this list 
but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents 

But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station

then the docking station isnt relevant for this project anymore 

No  but you otherwise you cant retrieve it 

I mean if its a simple chip  then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents 

But for two Euros and thirty cents  we uh we dont get a docking station 

if it would cost two Euros  that had a total a total thing  it would be nice too 

or we can ki do the kinetic cells 

But uh what can we do with the simple chip and whats difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip 

Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now 

yeah  but when we skip when we um when we dont use the do were not gonna make the docking station  then we still yeah  we need something else maybe to make it kind of special 

We can make a plain docking station for two Euros 

Wi wi without recharge

Ive got a schematic view of the remote control  but nothing about uh advanced chips or

You can look at it for s presentation 

I dont think here its in here already 

Was it working design or components design 

You know that a pushbutton requires a simple chip  but a scrollwheel  it it me requires
Okay  so we only need a simple chip 

it s uh only states that a scrollwheel requires a regular chip  and that a display requires an advanced chip 

And whats the sample sensor slash sample speaker 

Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up  page down 

So were gonna use the simple chip 
Nah  there is some money left to be spent 

I think we can make a docking station  Yeah 

we arent gonna apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway  I think 

maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something 
Instead of the rechargeable

Kinetics arent uh nowadays only used in watches and thats because youre always walking 

the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking 

Hey that maybe thats cool thats a cool thing about it  you know  You dont use batteries 

We can make a docking station for two thirty 

Yeah  but be serious  then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control 

but we uh we dont inc we havent looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff 

Well then its a useless project 

Yeah  then we dont have any innovation things 

Uh maybe it with the kinetic thing  I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing 

Cant we say fifteen Euros 

No  then we have to sell it for thirty Euros 

You can sell for twenty seven and a half 

No 

Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote  Battery and kinetic 

You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour  really 

Uh  a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time 

Because I think the d whole dynamic part  do you know  appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy  you know 
with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing  and y when you move it around a lot  then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and

Yeah  its funny for a week 

Okay  then we d Okay  well y we dont have to do it  but what that would just have a lack of key features  you know 

We can really can do the docking thing 

Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station 

No no  its not possible 

It w it wont tell  but

No  this not gonna sell  No 

Yeah  we just have to go all what we did today again  You have to do it over 

No no uh theres still theres still someth concept and something special left 

Yeah  and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well  to give it some just to give it some extra special feature 

Warning  finish meeting now 

well  we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet 

No  we cant 

Yeah  we have to Yeah  its

Yes  yes  Celebration 

I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire  to be honest
