Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that 

Um and we also talked about materials wed use and what kind of chip would be necessary 
Um so for later in the meeting Ive done a a spreadsheet of production costs

you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of

So our design looks something like this 
This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever 

And uh the base of the remote control  which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel  is interchangeable 
So you can change the colour  according to your to suit your living room or whatever 

You could change the vegetable  or fruit 

its trendy fruit  its not just ordinary fruits 

And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them  because theyll need to switch em out 

Its been a little bit difficult to um make sure that its handholdable 

Well the locator is just chip thats inside there 

And the beepers also inside there too somewhere

So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the
Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed 
Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset 

Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder  theres an Excel spreadsheet 
Um the only one thats in there  production costs 

But if I missed anything that weve gone over  or if you see something that has changed

I said uncurved or flat 

My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes 
But its really not very clear 

Theres plastic for that area around the button 

Um and lots of special colours actually 

Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine 
which is even less than twelve point five  which means wed be making even more of a profit 

Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project weve been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start 

And we we have therefore in total um We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated 
And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria 

True is one and and false is seven 

I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow 

Um we can do it separately and then discuss it

its if its fancy you put one 
if its really unfancy its seven 

Apparently Im supposed to use the whiteboard 

um is it necessary 

I dont think so 

Well just go in a circle 

Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four 

So its a one was true and seven was false 

Oh I thought it was the other way round 

I thought it was the other way round too 

Im Im sorry this was so tedious for everyone 

I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four  where um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote 

Well the worst ones were three point one 

Material technologically innovative 

What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat 

cause some of these are not as easy to hold 

I I personally dont think this is comfortable to to sit there  like its an awkward position 

although the broccoli is quite comfortable  I have to say 

we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber 

and just have the colour match or something 

We could make it that shape but just have different colours  and call em the different fruits 

And you could like if its like this  you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part 

Batteries easy to insert for some reason 

I think thats not a problem any more 

You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes 

It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape 
I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too 

I guess were supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied

Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of

The prototype making was very creatively stimulating
and I think weve come up with a product thats fun and meets all the criteria 

It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute 

Um yeah  I thought we all worked very well together 

Um and the means for like the materials we used  how convenient were they 

Well Im not a big fan of any Microsoft  PowerPoint or any of this stuff 

but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like

it was kinda like okay  I dont really think I dunno what Im doing here 

and I didnt really like the PowerPoint presentations 

My first bit of information was like this childs drawn picture of how a remote works 

Cause my problem was  you guys had access to like theyd put send you to sites and stuff

Yeah well mine was mostly made up

But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um

I felt like I was offtask all the time 

What do you guys think of the pens 

Theyre kinda hard to write with though 

all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it

And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video cause I missed a meeting 

theres really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting  like when youre actually at a real meeting in a real company 

Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence 
I wouldnt need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and

Cause I mean weve all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory  it fits the budget  and its trendy 

Okay we have to fill in all this stuff 

So I guess were supposed to write final reports 

All of us 

I dont know  Hmm 
Hmm  Or is that just me
