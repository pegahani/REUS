Were gonna just do a quick opening
and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another
um then were gonna start talk a little bit about tool training 

Um weve got a general plan for the project how were gonna go about accomplishing this

were making a remote control

Um weve got to make something as fashionable as possible 

and then finally well incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us whats possible
and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go

So its a three stage kind of thing 

for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it 

Im Marty 

Im a excellent Project Manager  Um 

Im Sarah 

and Im the Marketing Manager or something 

Im Ron 

and I am the User Interface Designer 

Im Nathan 

um and just write down Im just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs

uh project finance 

what were trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros  Um 

its pretty dear 

the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it 
Eur internationally 

one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably 

Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty 

um and Id like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done  like what the basic function of it 
Um UID well yeah you right g your assignments are up there

I need you to tell us what um we what the users gonna want 

and well discuss the tradeoffs in between

we cant kind of build it into other uh products 
For instance like a mobile phone or something like that 

I dont think theres any rules about it yet  So

can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less 

Maybe a remote with changeable faces  like the faces that you can buy for phones 

does anybody have any initial ideas 

as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do  like your microwave or your front door

but then  Ive never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons 

But Im thinking Im thinking kind of PDA uh design
so touch screen design rather than button
so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things 

weve got this kind of an idea of a tradeoff between um uh size and functionality 

but at the same time if you get it to do too much youre not gonna be able to tell them apart 

maybe like an L like a touch screen type of remote 

An interesting option 

Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes 

I think  making it out of a nice material would be very important 
because so many of those remotes that you see  these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality 

theres such a problem with losing them 
that adding this whole like PDA pen business is only one more thing to lose 

I like the idea of the uh multi plate 

I think  it wouldnt be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device 
maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote 

there used to be those whistling devices

Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing

that you could place something else

and it makes the remote page 

so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price 
Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote

Or if you our users in mind 

these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new lets design 

theyre used to the buttons
so well have to be careful of exactly who were marketing this to 

Im gonna put these initial ideas that weve got in the um project documents 

and then ov obviously uh the UID and the ID you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible
