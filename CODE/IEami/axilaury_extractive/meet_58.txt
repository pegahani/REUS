I sent you the agenda 

Anyway  its the meetings gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time 

it was on the in the project documents 

so well go round each of you in turn
and you can give your presentations on what youve been up to 
Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what youve come up with  so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts 

we need to know about the components properties  materials  the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching 

so I havent made a PowerPoint presentation 

I I thought Ill use the whiteboard instead 

I thought Ill use the whiteboard because we have so many different options
and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require
and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that 
Okay  so uh Ill start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control

If you open it  you have a circuit board here  right 
and this is the chip that I was talking about last time 
This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here  which then uh sends the information to an LED device here 
If you flip the printed circuit board  and this is th the most important point here 

So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the PCB

on pressing this button I a circuit completes 
the information goes to the chip  which is somewhere here
and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation  which goes goes out through there 
So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make 

so these are the different options that we have 

So the batteries  Ill start with the battery  right 
So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells  yeah 

And dynamos 

So uh I dont know if even if you want to consider this 

So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones 

The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches  since our hand keeps moving  it keeps the watch ticking 
But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control  because itll just lie there for a long while sometimes 
But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something 
And the fourth option is the solar cells  which are also made by the company 
Environment friendly 

There are different cases that can be provided 
They can be basically the shape of the cases  they can be flat 
they can be curved with uh onesided curved and one side flat 
and they can be curved with on both the sides 

Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control  yeah 

Yeah 

uh there were different kind of supplements available 
um like it can be in plastic  rubber  wood  or titanium  right 

so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment 
so its kind of um uh itll be probably nicer to use  because it relates to the overall image of the company 
but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface 

we can have pushbuttons  like most remotes do

the interface options now 

Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh

they can even have an an integrated uh pushbutton inside the scrolling thing 

we can have LCDs 

so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh

The PCB is uh inexpensive  so we can put put in uh whatever we want 
but the various integrated circuit options are  we have either a simple one
or a regular
or advanced 

okay  so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that LCDs can only come with the advanced chip 

we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels 

Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender 

besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender 
which is did not explained what i what it was 

So Im guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know  as soon as you press a button  it it mm uh give gives you feedback  one five or whatever 

I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not  but anyway 

now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know  uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that 

Right  interface concept 

Um to be honest actually  I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time  I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk 
So um yeah  this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again 

So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface
um so its the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um

uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data 
So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well  and colour  and so on 
Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet
and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness
and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant 

this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product 

So in in the case of many user interfaces  theyre just so full of buttons that its actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use
and um and its just confusing  it takes y know time to learn 

and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found 

so yeah  theyre quite big and have many many buttons 
Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one 
because its its the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well 
And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice 

Our own company has developed a new in user interface

we can uh include voice recognition

i its possible to record eighty different voice samples on it 

Um s another new development is a scroll button 

Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the LC display 

And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um uh programmable speech uh

uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition 

So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include 

but its once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker  there can be a um preprogrammed answer 

Um uh are you sure wha what this means  a spinning wheel with the LC display 

the scroll button is a different thing 
I I have a picture if you just a moment 

Oh okay  the iPod thing  yeah 

but I think its just like um its its a wheel  its like not separate buttons 

Its like its like where you you know how you have your your mouse  and y you go round and i its kind of like that and you spin round

I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get em much slower 

Do you know  if youre lookin if youre th scrolling through the A to Z of your music and youre looking for something at T  then its a lot faster than the wheel 
but youve got a lot less control over it 

Okay  and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time 

Okay  we decided to include voice recognition 
so to have the standard uh major buttons like on  off  um ch the channels and and then um volume
and then the rest would be a menu on the screen 
Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um
and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button 
I thought it could be for for voice like  I dunno  it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something 

Okay  straight to trends 

Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future 

Now  the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect  which is twice as important as the third a aspect 
So  I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the
which I think given the target group is what you would expect  really 
Um  you know  people want something new 
something technologically innovative and different 
so the whole idea with the LCDs and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like  quite the thing to go for 

So um uh maybe uh as youre discussing things  is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here 

so probably voice recognition is is kind of important  right 

And maybe the LCD and spinning

Okay  I I have a point about LCD 

W uh LCDs are basically for feedback  right  to the user whos pressing buttons 
and the feedback can come through television itself 
so do we need an LCD on the remote 

Depends how fast your television runs  really 

I mean weve got one of those um Telewest boxes
and you put the number in the remote

so i it actually takes quite a long time 

so I think  you know  a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that 

It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you dont interrupt the picture on the screen 

But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone  you know 
like you have the slidey ones
and you have the flippy ones

So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control  you know
or like a minimalist remote control 
So you got your buttons one to nine  your on and off and your volume on that
and then if you want to mess about with it  you flip it open and 

So now we seem to have a consensus that LCDs are definitely the way to go

Yeah  I think so 

because of style and

Okay  apparently  fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration 

Um so these will be an important feature for clothes  shoes and furniture 
So I mean  Im taking this to mean  you know  curviness 

Cause you dont tend to get flat vegetables  You know 

and possibly even uneven 

bit of asymmetry and stuff 
But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um RSI issue in there 

so you wanna you curve it so that its suitable for use with the right hand 
 Im not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy 

Something a bit squishy and

So it could be like a rubbery

and itd help if you drop it 

So if if we use uh latex cases  they wont allow us to use solar cells  as an energy source

Or if we want to use the the latex  then we have to go with one of the other um power things 

so um we could use titanium  wood or plastic uh or uh

If its made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there 

So probably double curved surface is the way to go 

Or or curved at one end and flat on the top 

You have to have a certain element of flatness  I think 

singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much  does it 

so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight

Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh

and  you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing 

because um according to the information that I have  I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three 

It does not say anything about uh whether technically  you know  this this stuff is available at all 

Uh its its more about the protecting the LCD  which I think is where it came from 
But no  my research didnt tell me anything 

Looking at what weve got  we we want an LCD display with a spinning wheel 

hand dynamos are definitely out  right 

its not thats not streamlined and sexy  having a having a wind up 

kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal 

Its about the practicality of it really  isnt it  You know 

this this thing will have to be tapped every time 
which which might be very frustrating for the user 

Depends how much how much movement it really needs 

Okay  lets keep it option uh keep an option 

It has to be at least curved from one side  yeah 

Wood  do you think wood will be a good idea 

I cant imagine a m wooden remote control 

and given that were were looking at more spongy material preferences  I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more

I mean its its alright for a table 

And splinters and stuff and

You have to have some pushbuttons  dont you 

I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them  wouldnt you 

if you have an LCD display  then mm you can select almost everything on the LCD display 

when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing  then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control 

I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made  where  you know  the buttons that people use all the time  you want buttons for them and everything else menudriven 

I think the thing is  so if someone just wants to turn on their TV and put on a channel  then it should be easier to use than any other remote 
and then if someone wants to  you know  change the contrast on their TV and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible 

So I think it it doesnt make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing 

Just spinning and not scrolling  I would say 

But I mean the the thing with this whole if y youre planning on making it out of rubber  on the basis that its spongy  then Im not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work 

But if youve got a if if youve got a flipped thing  effectively its something thats curved on one side and flat on the other side  but you folded it in half 

Im not sure itll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber 

the case would be rubber and the the buttons 

No  I think its just the casing rubber on the outside 

Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it 

Or maybe like interchangeable cases 

but I have like a you know  obviously my iPods not made of rubber 
but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it
and I can change the colour  theoretically  to match my outfit 

I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now 

And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than

it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company 
so would it be like yellow  grey and black or something  or

That doesnt fit in with the whole vegetable theme though 

Bananas 

but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons
and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours  do you know 

I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple
and that and then youd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it 

Uh since were having LCDs there theres no way that were will be able to
um what we do need to consider  however  is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering 
but since LCDs seems to be uh a definite yes 

So Ill rub off the other two 

So are we discounting solar energy because rubbers gonna be used in there somewhere or

a although it does seem uh interesting 

Uh okay  so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback  right 

I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost  then Id put them in 

And the case is curved on one side  but then flat flat  so its flipped into each other 

Flat on the top 

Uh um we were definitely going in for voice recognition as well as LCDs  mm 

the advanced chip

So weve basically worked out that were going with a simple battery 

using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one  I mean 

We need the advanced yeah 

and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself  um made out of rubber
and the buttons are also rubber 
Were having pushbuttons on the outside
and then on the inside an LCD with spinning wheel 

and its gonna look sort of vegetable 
and be in bright vegetable colours 

Youve maybe got  you know like if youre modelling on iPod youve got five buttons and a wheel 
and four of the buttons are in the wheel 
and the other ones the little bit inside the wheel 

Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design
and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation 
And as well as that  the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that weve just come up with using modelling clay
and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach 

In the meantime  the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design 

Okay  so now weve got thirty minutes before our next meeting 

And anyone who hasnt put their their presentation in the project documents folder  it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it
