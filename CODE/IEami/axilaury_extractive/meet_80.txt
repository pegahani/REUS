w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reactions uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control 

taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand
and uh we want to make this the the very best product th thats possible for everybody 

uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company 

um Ill just go round th the table 
Andrew  marketing 
um m Kendra with the uh um designing the the the User Interface
uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design  Um 

ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want 
uh everybody has a contribution to make

if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background

in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly

my names Andrew
Im a Im the Market Research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control
and uh yeah Ill be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design 
what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view 

Im Kendra
and Im the Us User Interface Designer and um
I havent had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before

Uh Im Katie 
Im the Industrial Designer
and Ill just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control

because the the whole idea is that its a um you know a think tank 

uh and we dont want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else

I dont want to make this meeting too structured

um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do 
The the remote control needs to be original 
there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls dont have

um and that goes along with being trendy  uh uh you know the I want it uh scenario 
A Userfriendly
as as we all know  remote controls can be uh uh very userunfriendly

And last but not least  or indeed first of all  it it must make the company money 

The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design  uh what it uh what it must actually do 
the uh conceptual design  uh how we actually present that to the consumer
and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production 
Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board
and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here  um
In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires  that we dont do that  um

everybody knows what whiteboard is
so well um uh well do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal 
but le lets go round the table 

Um  badger 

Um probably a duck

Uh s horses 

I think homo sapien

and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um 
we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros
so were were looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet
and and were looking at a gross profit of fifty percent 
It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make 

would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls 

I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons
and uh its handiest when you have one that works both the DVD player or whatever and the TV as well 
Um  but that its easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons

so I think its is best when theyre clearly labelled
and you can see which buttons youre supposed to use 

Or anybody else  strong feelings about remote controls 

Um I think its important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons itll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere
and you shouldnt have to like contort yourself

Think a lot of the time  remotes that come with TV players and TVs and DV players  like they arent

theyre very boring 

making a a stylish remote control would be a very like
Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition 
Um  Something that looks looks doesnt look like remote control 

I mean do you think theres a risk if it doesnt look like remote control 
people wont see it as a remote control

I think something thats comfortable to hold
because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big  rectangular things

so something thats more comfortable
that fits in a persons hand better 

that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see  like a mouse button 

remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it

whereas if you want
could all be flat

I mean the only thing is if if youre watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh
fi find the button buttons easily 

But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down

must admit I dont think Ive ever seen one with concave buttons 

I cant think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all 

Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something

we could have parallel marketing s schemes
where youve got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool  is fashionable

its its like uh its one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device 

I think its this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room

They they just need to be very very dependable
because people sort of take them for granted

it needs to be very effective  very always dependable  Uh

but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um  its just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah 

most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey 

I was just thinking of um what theyre doing with mobile phones now
how you can get the different um what are they called  Like the faceplates

I dont know if it would be feasible to do something with that 

so people can get different different things 

Again I dont think thats ever been done before 

but uh maybe thinking of that  its considering the nature of the device  maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray

since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one

you could come up with like novelty ones 

I think weve got um a good idea now 

Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly 

weve got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail 
Um then well we will reconvene in in thirty minutes
and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised
