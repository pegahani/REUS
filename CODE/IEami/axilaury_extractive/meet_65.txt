This is our functional design meeting 

our agenda today um

Um  Im gonna do an opening 

did you all get the minutes 
I emailed them to you 
Im also putting em them in the shared folder 
So um then I well talk about our general objectives
and have your three presentations 
Um Ill talk about the new project requirements Ive just received 
and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions 

Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification  what needs and desires are to be fulfilled  the functions design  what effects the apparatus should have  and the working design  how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function 

I dont know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online
or if Im the only one who is 

How do I hook my screen up 

theres a wee a wee plug just just that one there

And then you have to press function F eight

I I think you just have to push it in really hard 

were just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked 

They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab

and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had 

Focusing on their desires  um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly 
seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that

more importantly though  eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote 

and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age 
so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition 

That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes 
I think  over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration 
People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote
and I think that ties back to what you were saying before
just that theres too many buttons 

It also mentioned something called RSI
and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what RSI is 

Repetitive strain injury 

So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing  people do not like that 

Um looking at the needs people specified  the problem right now is that peoples remotes are not matching their operating behaviour 
People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote 

People also zap like to change the channel  about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use 
So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings  the screen settings and the channel settings 

the idea of an LCD screen was brought up
although they didnt have any details on what peoples preferences on that were 

also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote

make sure that  you know  something like an audio setting isnt given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing thats used a lot more often 
And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like 

Im gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um 
We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is 
Its a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television 

it sends a message to the television

First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications 

so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does 

and what the enduser is gonna want from this product 

a way Id suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product 
um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about
h how well these particular prototypes work 

When a users using a remote control  he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places 
So in some sense were gonna were gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design

But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas

Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities 
Uh the first of these is is technological

uh we need to find a balance between features and price 

things like voice recognition would would add to the price
uh but it would also im improve the design of the product 

I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls 
In analysing these we can consider what what things whats good about them 

um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found

Heres two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum 
Um on the left here weve got uh an engineeringbased design for a remote control 
so its one thats got lots of buttons 

The one on the right is a lot more basic 

It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it 

Uh theres a lot of features that are missing from that remote control 

everything you might possibly want to do is there 

Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device thats simple 

uh its got big buttons for doing the things I do most often  changing the volume  changing the channel 

thats ergonomically designed 

I think theres theres certainly a market for technology that looks cool 

did it let you go on the Internet

Uh that was just on the d on the company web site  yeah 

and then Im like wait it wont let me google 

this is our working design presentation 
Um I had a bit of some issues with this 
because I wasnt able to find everything I needed 

what were trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function 
Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder 

because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans

because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work 

So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function 

the findings that I got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver
and in my opinion infrared is the best way to do that

Um the user interface is critical here 
because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data 

the components that we find here are the energy source  you know the battery or whatever thats gonna m make it work  then the chip  which converts the data  the user thats controlling the chip  and the infrared bulb thats gonna let us move the data to the receiver 

And personal preferences  besides the fact that I cant spell  we need a longlasting energy source 

We need a chip that works well with the user interface 

and we need a reliable and clear infrared signal 

requirements  We have a couple new requirements

but were not gonna work with teletext

We didnt bring it up yet  or at all in the meetings so far 

Whats teletext 

Uh  its a British thing 

I suppose its kind of similar to a very very basic web browser 

this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it 

and it gives you information  mostly rather boring stuff like whats on TV next and share prices and that kind of thing 

Its earl its pretty old technology 

like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television  video  or etcetera  Just for television  Thats what were focused on 
Um otherwise becomes to complex 

Um and finally theres more marketing  I think  um  our corporate image has to be recognisable 

while were gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design 

Its Its kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics 

and we have that the emphasis on the Rs in um

Looks like  yeah  kind of a yellow and black

Its like double R 

we need to talk about our functions and our target group 

You um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing  you identified that different groups wanted different things

if were gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically  I think  a sort of younger group that thats whos gonna be attracted to this 

I do think  whos gonna have the money to buy that also  that one 

at least right now what were doing is um deciding on just the remote itself 

The only breakdown that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation

so its like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that thats a good idea 

thats probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway 

thats all specific for speech recognition 
Are we gonna use that as one of our functions 

I I would say no 
because its gonna add too much to the price 

And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises 

but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement 
Everything were talking about is ease of use and simple

If someones looking to buy a new remote  dont they want like an upgrade 

or we can look at um userfriendly 

And we also need to talk about if were only gonna have the very simple ones
or also have the other ones just separate somehow

like if it was just a simple  either this way or this way 

that had like the main buttons
and then you could like pull something out 

Cause then s like people who dont wanna ever look at them  never even have to see them

what are we emphasising  I what in this project 

Si simplicity and fashion 

which includes um an emphasis on making the infrared very functional 

What can you do to like make the infrared more functional 

I think its a lot to do with battery 

So s just the quality of the chip 

So our target group  were saying  fifteen to thirty five 

I dunno how useful that number is if were not doing

S voice recognition 

And if the whole idea is youre using a remote then why would you have voice 
like you know what I mean and then its like you wouldnt need a remote

Its for  like  the ultimately lazy people 

I mean if I get m more numbers  Ill email you before the next meeting in terms of ages 

but I th I think regardless were were aiming for the under sixty five or something 

can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families 

Its its hard to narrow it down 

I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages 

so its going to appeal to people  maybe people who have problems with technology  you know  people who get scared by having lots of buttons 

maybe we dont have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age 

So maybe its more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is

do we want some kind of thing to find it if its lost 
Like a button on a TV you can press

It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think 

Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost 
And we want um we want large buttons for the essential things 

We want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions 

Which are kind of hidden away in some way

Battery  Do we need a longlife battery 

We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all 

But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone  or like a little cradle for your iPod 

Yeah  thats thats possible  Yeah 

that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place 

thats thats a good idea 

Um after the meeting were gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary 

After that we have thirty minutes of individual work 
Um Ill make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides 
If everyone could do that as well  thatd be great 

I um ID Industrial Design youve your components concept 
User Interface  the user interface concept 
market trend wa watching 
And as as per last time youll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach emailed to you 
And hopefully  I hope  next time youll be able to access more of the web site

Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary 

were you able to like put yours in the group folder 

Hopefully it is there for people 

in there we have technical functions presentation  working design presentation and the functional requirements
