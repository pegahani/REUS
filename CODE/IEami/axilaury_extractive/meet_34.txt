actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting 

and uh well issue some information from uh all of you 
And its in the  I think uh  in the sharing folder 
And uh I will invite uh the Christine and the Ed and uh Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects 

the agenda of the meeting is opening 
Then uh Im going to talk about uh the project management 

and uh  of course  Im doing the project management and secretary both 

to take the minutes of the meeting 
And there are three presentations 
One is uh new project requirements 
And the second one about uh decision on remote control functions 
And uh finally we are closing 
Uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes 

management come with the new proposal 

and I have to discuss a few points on this 
Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project 
Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded  okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology 

we dont need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design 
And the second one is about uh the remote control 
Should be used only for the TV 

And the third point  its very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image  okay  with this new project or new product 

Ill invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design 

I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements 

and from my experience  I wanna uh  and from research I did  uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button 

Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them 

since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product 

thought we better look at things that are popular
and um ex go beyond those 
um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction  especially in the the uh the outside of the product

I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls

all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today
which I think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind 

you could throw it at things
if if the TV didnt turn on and off  you could use it for something else 

But um I just took some different uh schematics

and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board 

personal preferences  um

uh I Im really thinking outside the box here 
and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference 
So something thats very very flexible and inflatable

I think um it could either be you could go either one extreme 
be very colourful 
or you could make it clear 
and um kind of blend in with things 

Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof 
because uh sometimes they fall into cups

one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when its done its job or not 
because half the time  I keep pushing on the remote control 
and I dont know if its actually understood my message 
so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue 
And uh  course I never wanna replace the battery 

if you can add other facility  other feature  like uh unbreakable 

because uh especially today  you know  you have the family and the kids 

and the kids throw it

if you can add the feature  okay  for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay  with unbreakable 

I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product 

Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials 
Cause  for example  in the unbreakable thing  doing something plastic would be harder 
whereas having something like  I dunno  steel or titanium isnt really economically viable 

Titanium would be be heavy  too 

um I wanted feedback 

but well see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts 
I like titanium 

Expensive 

nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is  so um
Itd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though 

because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing 

I know the project plan and the budget 

I will I will send you a mail 

At the end of the day  the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million Euro 

and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side 

that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price

how much its cost for the manufacturing
and how much its going to be we sell in the market 

This remote control  okay  it can be for like universal  to use for any TV 

And I I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion 

and it will be slim 

Might be hard to find  though 

But lets try it  okay  with the different uh the designs  okay  the functional designs 

from the marketing yeah  from the marketing side  just to to give an idea what the management is looking for  I was looking for a a remote control to have a s
I have a sales price of twentyfive Euro 
with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro 
For what uh I think from what were trying to find  were tr were looking for  I dont think that price is exactly in the market 

in the recent surveys  uh from the ages fr from fifteen to thirtyfive  eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy 
Twentyfive Euros  uh thats thats a preson reasonable price 

Now if were gonna take a risk  and push this up a bit  make it more expensive 

then it w it could possibly sell 

But  I think uh theres one other thing interesting two things that are interesting
is that uh from the fifteen to thirtyfive yearold group  which always spends more money on trendy new things  speech recognition is requested 
And were talking between seventyfive to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote 
Obviously  we cant make a remote into a computer 
but maybe simple commands 

louder  softer  on  off 

Thirtyfive percent say theyre too difficult to use 
So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly 
Uh fifty percent say they cant find the remote half the time 
So maybe one word speech recognition commands 
say remote  and theres a beep beep beep 

But  in the cost that uh the management is looking for  thats not gonna be possible 

But if its trendy 
if its fancy 
its got some colour to it 
if its very easy easy to use 
if its got simple remote speech remote uh control  like I said  louder  softer  change channel  on  off  remote  it goes beep beep 

So were gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea  with the ideas of the industrial uh design 
But  price obviously we have to talk about 

What do you think about uh the design  uh what he was talking about of the speech recognition 

training is always an issue with uh commands 

uh we can perhaps um do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process 

But um anyway  um I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life 

maybe what well have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly

or maybe uh set it out in the sun

I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset

and it uh  you know  gets uh  from the light  um a a solar cell inside there

It seems also like with the speech recognition  yeah  its a great feature 
but if youre watching TV  theres a lot of ambient sound 

so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the TV speech  and the the users speech 

Because tha w with speech recognition uh th Im not that good at that idea

Because I think s with speech recognition  if uh the the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear 
I dont think it would come through a sentence in a television 

what I can uh suggest to you  Christine 

uh if you need some uh the technical feedback  or some training  okay  about uh this facility  especially for the speech recognition  I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or IBM 

because theyre already in this uh speech recognition part 

and uh if you want  I can coordinate  okay  to get some information 

and uh you can uh let me know  okay  so what kind of uh the details you require okay  to add this feature in this project 

we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop  apart from uh what today 

From from your side uh  youre gonna have to go back the management
and s be more s precise 
What do they want 
Uh  a risk  take a risk on the market 
Something thats gonna cost more  but could very easily s make a boom in the market 
Because it has to be something totally different 

but end of the day  youre the sales guy 

Its uh of course its uh good to uh tell the management how much its cost us

I dont mind to convince  okay  the management to spend some more money on the project  okay  if you can make out of

The management says  okay  so they they dont want certain facilities 

they want something uh new 

I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree 

And uh I hope I can convince the management on that 

the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people dont like about existing products 
So  in our case  existing remote controls 

We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad 
but when you look  technically  at how it works  sometimes thats not the case 
Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep 

Um and then what the remote control should look like 

in terms of the functionalities that we need  you obviously need to be able to turn the TV on and off 
You need to change channels  both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing 
You need to be able to control the volume
and then control any menus on the TV to regulate contrast or whatever 

the problems that people have expressed is that theres too many buttons on remote controls  in general 
The buttons its not clear what theyre supposed to do 
Um often  you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done 
um which you dont necessarily always remember  especially if its a functionality that you dont use very often 

here weve got two examples
where here on the lefthand side  you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons 
The buttons  in a lot of cases  are tiny 

theyre labelled 

but the labels dont necessarily tell you too much 
Whereas  on the other side  you have a much simpler remote control
that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed 
And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it 
So  I would be inclined to go sort of towards this  in terms of design  rather than this 
And if theres specific functionalities that require more buttons  then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons 
So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit  or to a minimum 

make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed  so like the on button being really obvious one  the channel changing and the volume 
and to keep the design basically sleek and simple 

Clearly your research and uh and ours uh heading in the same direction 

the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it 

I also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh  when you hold it  is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design

cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designers more thinking about  th th the look and the feel 

thats definitely a very important factor  especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases  I think 

for anybody need uh any help  for time being  on this uh subjects  okay  so please come back to me 
and uh Christine  maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies
to help you for uh make a design uh slim 

and to add some features  like we are talking about  the speech recognition and all 

Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include 
cause weve thrown a lot of features onto the table 

do we actually want to incorporate all of them 
or have we missed anything 

Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide 
maybe that would provide some guidance 

it says individual actions 

so Im supposed to do the components concept 
supposed to work on the user interface concept 
and youre supposed to keep watching the trends 
Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach 
I think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now
and eliminate them later in the process 

I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that were just gonna end up throwing away 
I mean  it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features  um
and s if we spend that time and effort on features that were not gonna use  maybe its better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want 

I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting 

what well do is now well take for lunch break 

cause w our meeting time has run out
