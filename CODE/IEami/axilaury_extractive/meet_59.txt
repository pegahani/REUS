This is our final meeting  the detailed design meeting 

what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two 
so you can show us what youve been working on so diligently 

It does look very cool 

then Cats going to present the evaluation criteria that were going to be evaluating this against 
Then I need to say some st a few things about finance 
cause we have to check that its within the finance criteria 
Um and then well be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits 
Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that weve been through 

so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things
and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things  like the buttons and the scrolling things and

Okay  So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana 

You think bananas are a safe thing to use 
Its a bit um phallic 

Well  but its its just an a approximation 

Um so basically its the its the flip open thing again 

And it flips open on the side  so it opens like that 
And we have the user interface o in here
and uh the the LCD and and the scroll are inside 

And its the whole things made of rubber  is that

so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable 

yeah  but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing  that one side was supposed to be rounder 

Is it to scale  or do you think you can make it a bit smaller 

Um it could be made a bit smaller 

So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things 
So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three

So its four  up to four  up to seven  up to nine and zero  z zero here 

And then  well this is on off button 

and and also the colour is quite often red 

And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and

And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here  previous and ne prevon prevon next 
The volume is is scrolling 
On the side 

And and and its its on the back is mm cover or back lid  because if you flip it open  you can still do the scrolling here 

and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose 

Oh  the thing we forgot was like a mute button 

Well  well have this on the screen  on the display 

On the wheel  like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute 

Uh on the LCD we r you know  the main menu will have various options 

yeah  the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute  right 

if its a scroll and click so you hold it in 

But if you hold it in 

And okay  so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it 
You cant really see it in the interface 

And its with the the black and yellow youre even in the right colours 

Yeah  I think um we could do l the logo in grey  as it is on the website 

I suspect were gonna have a couple of minor finance issues 
but um well se Im sure we can get around them somehow 

So what were gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design 
Um so were gonna be using a seven point scale 
so one is  you know  yes  it totally meets with that requirement
and seven is  no  it really doesnt  we need to go back and start again 
Um  you know  Basically  what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that weve done and weve worked on and like made a list of them 

So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven 

I did have A  B  C  and D down here 
but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points 
Okay  But if you can imagine that they say A  B  C  and D  then that would be really good 

Okay um uh what Ive done on the next page is Ive set it up so we just put the marks in 

If you take a note of them 

lefthanded people cant normally write righthanded 

Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for righthanded people than for lefthanded people 

Does it match the operating behaviour of the user 

so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version  which is like exactly the mirror image of this one 

So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation 
maybe give it a five  I would say 

Or maybe six 

It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up  right 

I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top 

Yeah  but we which makes it kind of really big  yeah 

or are we saying were gonna stick a locator on the TV 

th theres the locator dot 

Mm that you stick on TV 

so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though 

To make it beep 

so thats seven  yeah 

If uh uh if this means intuitive  if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things

Id say six 
cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one  rather than the way youve got it 

but its not the immediate thing that youre used to 

but uh its a good technology  I mean once they get used to it 

So  should we maybe say f a five

so possibly for lefthanded  Investigate 

But otherwise its superb 

So  should we give it a six 

Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design
well mm I mean I d uh I dunno  I mean the the repetitive stress things 
but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway 

And moreover it it has um LCD and everything 
so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway 

Okay  so we give that a six 

G technologically innovative 

its the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen 

Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well  which is yeah  its kind of new 

All of the components have been used in other things before 

Theyre never been used i theyve never been using remote remote control before I dont think 

What do you reckon  five  six 

Six 

Put fashion in electronics 

Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days  so 

So  we need the average here 

So I think weve done very well 

The average is about six and something 

Six point five  yeah 

thats pretty good  I think 

so weve looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria 
And now we have to calculate the production costs 
So Ive got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that 

Um I started filling it in 

No hand dynamo  right 
One simple battery 

The chip  were going for an advanced chip on print 
We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker 
Um singlecurved surface  so that we can fold it 
Case material we said rubber 
I dont know what special colour means 

I think something coloured 

but rubber comes coloured  doesnt it  You know 

maybe its like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured  its different 

Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it 

We have pushbuttons 

Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had  no 

And we have LC display

And button supplements 

Yeah  but what do we ha we have LC display  but but the wh but the s spinning wheel

Weve got more than one pushbutton though 

That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesnt it 

That seems unlikely 

whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we

We have to count all of them 

I dont think that makes sense 

if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five 
its a scroll wheel so we weve put its pushbutton and scroll wheel and LCD display 

So  as we can see  thats way too expensive down here 
Our budgets twelve point five 

Yeah  the sample sensor will have to go 
cause thats the most expensive thing on there 

so that has implications though for the 

Uh it does not have for voice recognition 
but it does have for the feedback speaker 
when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello 

But thats a bit of a gimmick anyway really  isnt it 

Mm and the locator also goes away 

Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive 
but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps 

A also i in the case Im not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface 
because its just rubber  so its probably a flat surface rubber 

Right  so we need one fifty off 
Take it down to just a scroll wheel 

in the LCD we can scroll  right 

how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the LCD 

But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button 

you can push this one 
but we dont have a pushbutton uh we ca we dont have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing 

So thats point three 

and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing 

The scroll wheel is on the side 
Were point three over at the moment 

Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether
and just have pushbuttons for the volume 

Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here  up for up and down 

Oh look  were way under budget

Yeah  well we could admit to the single curve  couldnt we 

Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour 

So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria  as a result of doing that 

No  I dont think so 

Because we keep all the features 
we keep voice recognition 
we keep LCD display 

instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons 

But we lose the locator 

so we still have the locate 

Were gonna have a beep 

It can come in the same colour as the the case 

so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went 
um so that we can feed back to the management for next time theyre designing a product 

as far as creativity is concerned  yeah I think there was there was room for creativity 
The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had 

I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with 

If wed had that sheet at the beginning shouldve been like  okay  so we can have that lot  lets just throw it together and do what we can 

But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting  that that worked in terms of 

I think cause the meetings were so regular  you know 

Yeah  the m the means were very very good  the means we used 

the whiteboard digital pens 
We like the pens 

But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint 

I was I was satisfied with with the leadership  yeah 

Yeah  and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the

I mean especially with that lastminute alteration 

I mean that was fairly tight anyway 

But yeah  but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting  yeah 

You werent like a a dictating leader  so that was always good 

And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely  yeah 

Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit 

Mm  I guess it was a fairly small group 
so all of us got to express our opinions  yeah 

New ideas found 
Not quite sure what about 

Well its its its pretty new 

I think wed like to think the ideas were new 

costs are within budget 

One Euro left over for bits that we didnt foresee 
Um weve evaluated the project 

Can you put that in the project documents file 

And the process wheel didnt really have any major problems with 

And my main difficulty was the the time pressure 

sometimes its like a little bit rushed 

weve got like five minutes left 

but if weve finished  then weve finished 

Yeah  it was a pleasure working with you 

So I would say thats the end of that meeting 

Right  so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it 

Was there a questionnaire already sent 

Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now 

I dont see why you cant stay here  really
