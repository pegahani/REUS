Good morning everybody 

Um Im just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us  for our kickoff meeting 
My name is Rose Lindgren 
I Ill be the Project Manager 
Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening
and then Im gonna talk a little bit about the project 
then well move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit  including a tool training exercise 
And then well move into the project plan 
do a little discussion

Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about 
it needs to be original  trendy and userfriendly 

Um so were gonna divide us up into three compa three parts 
First the functional design
which will be uh first well do individual work 
come into a meeting 
the conceptional design  individual work and a meeting 
and then the detailed design  individual work and a meeting 

Um were gonna do a little tool training 
so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you 
Um introduce yourself 

and then draw your favourite animal

My name is Alima Bucciantini 

and I guess Im the Industrial Designer on this project 

I will draw a little turtle for you all 

my name is Iain uh
and Im the User Interface Designer for the project  Um 

Its a whale  yes 

Im Jessy 

Briefly  its supposed to be a seal 

Were gonna talk about project finances 

wed like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales
and because this is such this is for television its a we have a market range of Internet  like its an international market range 

Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude  we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro 

just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um  I could Id like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls 

what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like

Um I hate when theres like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the TV

cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload 

especially  like you know if Im watching TV I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me  you know  one for the TV  one for the digital box  one for m the video recorder as well  Um 
And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing 

uh too too sort of too sort of complicated

theyve got too many buttons on them

and that theres not too many buttons 
they are not too small 

like are there some remotes that don dont require like batteries

but its possible we could use like a lithium battery

it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes 

doesnt have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder

but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything  you know volume control  on  off 

so its like if youre looki if youre trying to get the TV on thats  you know  like the top thing on the remote  I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how were gonna make it  but if its like all the TV stuff was here 
then all the VCR stuff was here 
all the whatever else we have programmed into it its all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together 

and if um if youd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldnt need to use every day 

would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it 

are we designing a remote control for a television only

Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it 

Ill look into that 

I guess we have to define what what were aiming for 
If its just a television then that its a bit simpler 

If you have older people or people like me that arent very coordinated handeye  its really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons  if we can help it 

Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes 

Um the industrial design  Alima will be doing um the working design 
Um the User Interface Designer  thats for  Technical functions  I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing  the size of the buttons 
Um user requirements um  so youll be hearing about different trends  uh about different things that people need 

And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach 

What were gonna be discussing at the next meeting 

I havent gotten an agenda yet 
um Ill put that together 
Im sure as well each get our own instruction

Can you email your slides as well 

Yes  I yes  I think I can 

Ill just attach it to an email 

Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails 

Ill type up mi minutes
and probably email those out to all of you  Um just including all the things that we talked about  Um 

so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on  off  channel changing  volume  and another rote remote with all the special things
