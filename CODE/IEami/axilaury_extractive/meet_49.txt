Um Im Sarah 
the Project Manager

Okay  this is our agenda  um

get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other 
Um then well go do tool training 
talk about the project plan 
discuss our own ideas and everything um

Now  were developing a remote control which you probably already know 
Um  we want it to be original 

um  trendy 
appealing to a wide market 

and userfriendly 
grannies to kids  maybe even pooches should be able to use it 
Okay  um  first is the functional design 
um this is where we all go off and do our individual work 
um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product 

Um  conceptual design 

and then the detailed design 
how were actually gonna put it into practice and make it work 

Were gonna practice with the pens
and draw our favourite animal on the white board 

and um sum up the characteristics of that animal 

Im going to tell you thats supposed to be a tiger 

Uh  maybe you can guess what Im trying to make 

A kind of dog 

Okay  now Im gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be

Yeah  it can be a crocodile  it can be a crocodile 

its meant to be an eagle

Um financewise  weve got a selling price at twenty five Euros 
which I dont actually know what that is in Pounds  at all 

Seventeen 

Okay  thats expensive 

Should we be making notes of this 

Ill be able to um pull it up 
or I could put it in the shared folder or something 

Havi having said that though  if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment theyre s theyre about twenty pounds anyway 

um production costs at twelve fifty  so

Um  and profit aim is fifty million Euros 

Youve got market range international
and you did say earlier its got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups

What are your experiences with remote controls 
I mean Ive got we got um we had three videos  a TV and a sort of amp thing all set up
so we got one of the universal remote controls  um that you programme each of your things into 
but that kept losing the signals

but that was quite good  the fact that you could You didnt have six remote controls sitting in front of you 

My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy 
not doing any tampering with it and programming 

I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do

And symbols that you dont necessarily understand 

So simplification of symbols you could think of 

and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording  things like that inside it 

but you know on a mobile phone  you can press a key and it gives you a menu  its got a menu display 
I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful 
so youve got a little LCD display 

instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user  may h maybe have an LCD di display or something like that 

What about the older generation 

thats gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps 

I dont like the  you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windowsbased running system 
I find it really confusing 

Yeah  I dont I dont know how for twenty fi  or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get 
youd youd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white LCD thing anyway  Id assume 

The other thing is  just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again  it could have a flip top remote control

I think thats a cost thing 

And theres no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone 
it can still be lightweight plastic  you know 
Something thats easily moulded and produced 

weve got half an hour before the next meeting 
so were all gonna go off and do our individual things  Um

and then well come back and liaise again
and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation 

about what youre saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable 

I I had a quick look at the company website
and its like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics 

I mean you dont you you can still have plastic

we dont have to use metal 

and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic 

I mean theres Sky remote controls and everything 
Theyre kind of moulded

so yeah I guess thats stuff we can think about 

So  see you in half an hour 

Okay  so lets break it up there 

um what effects the product has to have
