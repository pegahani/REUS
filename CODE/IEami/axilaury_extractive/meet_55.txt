Uh oh Ive forgotten to mail you the minutes 
but I will do 

Um Will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news 

Okay  have you got a presentation to make 

No  not mine yet 

We made three for you 

Um ones based on the banana  ones based on the tomato

so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one 
or as mm few buttons as possible 
mainly speak recognition 

If you do need buttons  you can flip it over  and theres some there 

Well I like the feel of it  I like the feel of it 

but thats the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand 
Um the black on the back is the slogan 

but also were gonna have the company name on the front  which is the little black kind of line in the middle 

These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down 

it does actually feel quite ergonomic 

It would have to be a bit bigger 

Um  obviously I dont think thats real sized 

Um thats a speaker at the top 

Oh thats the charging base prongs at the bottom 

And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one 

and and um we have the bananabased one too 

This one is uh  I suppose for the younger audiences 

Well  nice to have uh options at least 

So are there any um improvements or issues or

Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance 
Uh  lets just enter in the um evaluation criteria 

the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons  uh its gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros 

So basically  um in order to save our two Euros um I was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape  but just have it flattened 

Doesnt save us quite as much 

W why is the uh double curved two of them 

Oh  good point 

I think it means double curved as in um
like uh a single curve on that bottom half  and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward 

and why why Ive got it two  I dont know 

But you think it should be one 

Um okay  so that would take away three  which would give us

Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty 

So we could even add something 

Ah yeah  we could add things 

Yeah  if were happy with the design theres no point in spending money  if we dont have to 

Project process  how do we think that went 

Yeah I think we have a a winning product 

Uh room for creativity  were we happy with that 

W I think we were very creative 

Leadership 

Great leadership 

Uh teamwork  I thought went well 

Yeah  everyone got enough input  I think 

These pens are are neat though 

Yeah  these are new ideas  like glowinthedark or something like that 

So just general thumbs up for all of us then 

Uh Brian  have you have you finished 

At last mine is also the presentation 

Oh  you got a presentation 

we forgot to mention
itll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex  new material that weve got 

So now is the final evaluation  final evaluation of the uh uh of our product 

whether it meets our standards or not 

w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything 

We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements  whether it meets the user requirements or not  this product 
Then trends  whether it is as fashion trends or not 

Then marketing strategy of the company 

Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale 

what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not 

It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted 

Seven is good  yeah  isnt it 

True or false 

Uh one is means highest ranking 

So its one for from your point of view 

Im gonna give it a two 

Oh  Ill go for a one 

Uh for me personally it is everything fine 

but there is one thing which limits the customers 
like we are having only two  three designs 

But if a person doesnt like banana  or orange  you are limiting him 

So we are showing our preference for particular fruits 

Is that no is that not trends 

because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits  they give a range of products  a range of shapes 

But in electronics  I think  its not q always quite so um you dont always have so many choices as with chocolates 

we are doing a very wrong thing 

Were gonna average them 

About one point f one point eight 

I have taken it very wrongly 

Well um going on uh the specifications that we had  that fruit and vegetables are quite popular  and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons  I would give it um 

so I would actually give it a three 

Kay  As far as the uh technology it its got the latest trends in speech technology 

um but it doesnt have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism 

it might be trendy to some  but Im just not swallowing the fruit 

well  because its hard to make a fruit good to look at  that that looks cool  you know 

It is cus spongy also 

Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends  these products are quite good 

So what about company strategy 

Well  I think its the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy 

Pretty much kept to the company strategy  so I would go for a a one  as we not only kept it  but we were limited by

Uh overall we are getting two something 

So we can launch it  Yeah 

Cause weve evaluated and we are within budget
