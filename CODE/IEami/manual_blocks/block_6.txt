B :  Now what .
A :  'Kay , hello everybody . Uh , I guess you all know what is it about , you all received the email , I guess . Uh , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control . So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project .
A :  And uh so I'm present myself . I'm Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself .
A :  So I dunno , you can starts .
B :  Okay , so my name is Petre . You can call me Petre , or Peter if you like . I don't care .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh my name's Bob Mor . Oh , sorry .
A :  And you are ? In the project ?
B :  Uh , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic .
D :  'Kay . So my name's Bob Morris . I'm the Marketing Expert for this project . Bob yeah .
B :  Bob , okay .
C :  My name is Hamed Getabdar , and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project .
B :  Okay .
A :  So , uh , so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project , so um
A :  We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project . We are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , and , yeah . So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting .
A :  Um . So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control . So it should be , of course , new and original , and um it should be trendy , and user friendly . That mean it's a very challenging project , and uh
A :  uh . So w it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that
A :  people want to buy .
A :  So , um
A :  So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project ? So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way .
A :  Um .
A :  Yeah and everything is will be like this .
A :  Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project . So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . So uh . For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
A :  Uh . So uh
A :  So I will ask you all to do the same . Just to get used to the whiteboard .
B :  Okay .
B :  So probably I would try to try to draw the animal . Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ? I I th I think I should .
D :  Yeah go ahead .
A :  Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course .
B :  Okay , so .
B :  Um .
B :  Okay , American , um . Um . I would use the bird .
B :  So I tried to sketch it out .
B :  I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it , but ah .
B :  Can you recognise it as a bird ?
B :  Okay it's your turn to
D :  Okay , okay .
D :  So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat .
A :  Oh .
D :  That's its head . Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful .
D :  Okay .
C :  I dunno if I should go with this .
B :  Oh it's okay .
D :  Thanks .
C :  If it is enough line . I'm sorry .
D :  Maybe put it up Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I should get used to the tool , so . Oh just wait a little bit . C could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ? Ah probably not .
C :  Okay .
C :  They should be remote .
B :  Okay , it it works like this .
D :  Uh , that's better .
C :  Okay , thanks .
D :  Your lapel microphone's fallen off .
B :  Are you left-handed ? Oh , pity .
C :  No .
C :  Okay . Should I clean ?
C :  Okay , I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful , so if I want to write it here , I think I can .
C :  Oh .
A :  Never mind .
B :  Ah , it's maybe better if you leave it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Maybe we should just continue . Yeah , don't worry about it .
A :  Yeah .
A :  , no worry .
D :  No .
C :  Okay .
B :  You won't draw them , or ?
A :  You can draw it , if you want .
C :  I dunno if I can . Okay . It may be like a cow or I dunno , whatever . I'm not good very good in drawing . Okay , so this is very It's a bird , I think . I dunno what is it .
B :  Just try . I would like to see how it looks like .
B :  No , I think it's clear .
C :  Four .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . I'm shameful Yeah . Okay .
D :  Oh that's good , it's good .
B :  It's okay . It's in it's indeed beautiful .
A :  Good .
D :  Yeah , and strong .
B :  Okay .
B :  Bob . Have to remember it .
B :  Bob .
A :  So good um So , let's talk about money . Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro . And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro .
A :  And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world .
A :  So n not only for Switzerland , but for the world .
A :  Uh .
A :  So , um .
A :  The We expect a production cost of maximum
A :  uh twelve point fifty Euro .
B :  Per unit , I guess . Y oh okay .
A :  Yeah , of course .
A :  Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . Anything .
B :  Okay .
D :  Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . Um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um .
A :  Mm .
B :  Oh .
D :  So it's frustrated me in the past , th that .
B :  Okay , I have also some points uh . Maybe two points . Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . So something like this .
A :  Yeah .
B :  And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control . But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Ah , okay . Okay .
B :  You know , some slider or Not just two discrete buttons for volume , but something which
A :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay , n
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Is that because the of the discrete volume levels , or is that
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume .
A :  Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can
D :  Yeah .
B :  Ah , n .
B :  If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream .
A :  Yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and
B :  Yeah , f It depends what what you feel about that .
A :  you have a heart attack .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if you have some more notes on that .
A :  Yeah so you can Do you have something ?
C :  Uh I Yeah , just a simple experience . I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune .
A :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  Yeah without obstacles and .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Let's continue . I have a meeting in five minutes , so maybe we should hurry . Um . So we will close uh this meeting . So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes .
B :  Um .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay , just a second .
A :  Um .
A :  Uh . The So I will ask you to do some work . Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and
B :  Which i which is Hamed , ? Okay .
A :  read about Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  He's the Industrial Designer ? No , you're the Industrial Designer .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Uh I am the Technical Designer , I dunno which one , uh v .
A :  Oh .
D :  Yeah , I think that's the first . I_D_ . Industrial Designer . And the second one is the User Interface Designer .
A :  Industry and Oh .
C :  Uh-huh .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  User Interf Okay .
D :  And then last one's marketing , which is me .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , so I'm the first one .
A :  So , um
A :  For the User Interface Designer , which is Hamed um ,
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  uh , you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control .
B :  I see .
C :  Okay .
A :  And for the Marketing uh
A :  Manager , I dunno , okay , which is Bob , uh
A :  you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control .
A :  Um , you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach .
B :  Sign .
A :  Yep finished .
A :  So I see you in thirty minutes .
D :  Great , okay . Thanks guys . Bye .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay , thanks . Bye .
A :  Thank you .
B :  Uh .
A :  So um nice to see you again . Uh . So , uh .
A :  Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes .
A :  Uh so we will see our three presentations .
A :  Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .
D :  Okay , can I have the laptop over here , or ? Okay . Have to get up .
A :  Yep . Oh , I don't think so . I think you have to come here .
A :  I dunno .
A :  I think it should stay .
D :  Excuse me . Okay .
B :  Yeah , that's it .
A :  Should stay in the square here .
D :  Okay .
A :  Oh , maybe .
D :  Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . Um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls .
A :  Oh , you can put it here . Oh that's okay , it's jus
D :  So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . Um they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . Completely ugly . Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ . Um , that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it . Um and
D :  thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . And from this we basically came up with the figure that
D :  the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control . Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching T_V_ . Um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um ,
D :  all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control .
D :  And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . Um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well .
D :  So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . And
D :  fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . Um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . Um and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury .
D :  We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control . In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control . Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . They want these features , they want these high technology features . Um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features .
D :  Whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market . Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . That's my dic that's my presentation . Thank you .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Thank you .
C :  Okay .
A :  So , um
A :  maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device . So uh Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ?
B :  Well , okay , yeah . Yeah , but the user user interface is responsible .
A :  No .
C :  B you think uh I I'm User Interface Manager . Okay . Okay . If I could go there with this cable .
A :  Ah . Sorry , I'm Sorry . Sorry .
B :  Okay , so .
B :  You're scaring me with L_C_D_ man . And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive .
D :  Yeah , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want , so it's And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally .
C :  Sh okay .
D :  It is true .
C :  Where's delete button ? Okay .
C :  Oh I'm sorry .
C :  Okay .
D :  That's the wrong one , I think .
A :  Yeah , it's still Bob Morris . Yeah you should have put yes .
C :  Oh . Presentation three ?
B :  Because you cancelled it .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh .
A :  Click on yes .
A :  yeah .
B :  Yep .
C :  Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design . I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . Okay , uh , first what is a remote control ? Simply it's a device , as you know , for uh , for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device . And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . Uh i it has different blocks , different blocks . Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands .
C :  And then inter then make uh these keyboard commands , uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands . And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to uh r to realise the command .
C :  Okay , uh about what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control . They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves . There are two different uh uh solutions I mean . This is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves .
B :  You still want me the presentation .
C :  And uh also as uh I understood , and uh I think it was a part of uh Bob , uh uh presentation , people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button . So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control .
C :  And uh personal preferences , uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . Okay . That was my presentation .
D :  Okay .
D :  I have a question .
C :  Uh-huh .
D :  Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ?
C :  Uh , I don't think so , because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home .
D :  Okay .
A :  So can we use any any frequency ? We have the right to use any frequency ?
B :  Yeah , it should be okay .
C :  Uh no but as I know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit . We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission .
A :  Okay . And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? And so do they have the same frequency , or ?
C :  Uh for this I'm not uh I I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it Yeah , identification code inside the
A :  Okay . A kind of identification , okay .
B :  Yeah f uh I know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . It's uh kind of handshaking , uh , when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . Well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay .
A :  So
A :  Yeah .
A :  So
A :  Okay .
C :  The password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem . A specific uh remote control has a specific f
B :  Yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy . It's worth to buy . And they have these problems solved so . So we don't have to think about these .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . So , maybe you can talk about the function , and
D :  Okay .
B :  Yes . I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh
B :  in this company . I was used to use Linux before , so . But I tried to
B :  tried to break through this too , I guess .
A :  Open .
B :  Mm . Ah .
B :  Okay .
B :  How to make it big ?
A :  Slide show .
C :  Five .
B :  Slide show . Okay , thanks .
A :  It should work , so you can .
B :  Okay . Oh so I will speak about working design . That's the first slide . Uh what uh I have to do ? A look at what the other company Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them . So , you know .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh , okay findings , that's the point that I'm working on currently but uh so far I I was uh looking what what are the blue circuit , I mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , but the prices I read are high . So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Uh . Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . It depends uh on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition , because the speech rec Yeah ?
D :  Are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ?
B :  No no no no no . This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves .
D :  Okay s
D :  So we just buy a circuit board and Okay .
B :  Exactly .
B :  But I'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . This I prefer that we should make ourselves .
D :  Okay .
B :  But it depends whether we take a decision to use it . Same thing . It's fairly expensive to use these circuits . So , speech recognition well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? Or it would be maybe feasible ?
B :  Yeah , I'm
B :  Oh . I was not thinking too much about the price . But if we use the L_C_D_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know , uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . We will discuss it afterwards .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
B :  Oh , this is nothing . This is just my notes on what to use . And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . That's my opinion . Uh I mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency .
A :  Why ? Because it's simpler ?
B :  Because because the the range where you can use it is fair . It's okay I think . And the price is fairly cheap for this . Well , depends .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay . It's a a price matter .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Jus just the price . Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
B :  So I I I think it's o y o . Well , three to three to five . N not ten times , but it depends what what we
D :  What how much more expensive ? Are we talking three times more expensive ? Or ten times more expensive ? Or
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah yeah . That's still a lot . I think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money , because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . So it's not worth spending the extra money .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well I , oh
B :  Yeah . Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so , I don't know .
D :  Yeah .
A :  On the other side , we want to have something new . You know , where
D :  Yeah .
A :  we want to
A :  to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it . But maybe .
D :  But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . So I think we're better off spending money in the usability phase .
A :  Okay .
B :  You the user interface , and management man , uh
A :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Uh okay , that's it for me .
A :  Okay , thank you Peter . So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . Um
B :  'Kay .
D :  Mm .
A :  first um , they say that's uh about something about t teletext . Uh apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date . Out-dated . And uh
A :  Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and
A :  actually it's not useful to have teletext .
A :  Um .
A :  So I think we can avoid the teletext . Um the second thing is uh
A :  they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it it makes it's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the only specific T_V_ remote control .
B :  I agree .
A :  The third the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . So um uh we should we should keep uh The the product should be recognisable . Uh , uh
A :  It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of in electronics .
A :  So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company .
A :  So , um
A :  So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . So , mm , are we going to use L_C_D_ , speech recognition ?
A :  Uh .
D :  Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And then we can move on to the more advanced features .
C :  Mm . Yes .
A :  Maybe , maybe .
B :  Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . Uh radio frequency depends . And , well the recognition it depends on you guys . You should probably speak .
A :  Yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? I mean
B :  Okay .
A :  what do
D :  Okay , well , I mean the obvious one is changing channels .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . So , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , okay .
A :  So , turning channel , of course . Volume setting .
B :  Uh just one note to the chan channel changing . Do we will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? I mean those nine plus one or two ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think it would be a b
B :  Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's
D :  Yeah , I
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay so so we keep all these all these buttons .
C :  Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button .
A :  Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like
A :  uh
B :  Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something .
A :  Yeah . Maybe something like that .
B :  Or using the names and the keyboard I dunno .
D :  Ah yeah .
A :  Uh .
C :  Or
C :  Or something .
A :  Maybe Oh I don't know .
A :  Oh .
A :  Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  You mean like hierarchical structure .
A :  And inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch . If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . I It just an idea . I don't know what you think about that but .
C :  Okay . Like categorising channels .
B :  Okay , so s Oh sorry .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
B :  So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you
D :  To have some feedback . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , probably , yeah , yeah .
B :  Okay , so I'll make a note on L_C_D_ .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel . So we c you could quickly just through many channels . For the channels , perhaps .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . Like roller for the Yeah . Okay .
A :  Anything else ?
D :  So we've got channel and volume . Um .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one ?
D :  I think so . I think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones .
A :  Yeah .
A :  What about the settings of the T_V_ ? Because it's button we don't use very often , but
A :  it's we need it anyway . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  So uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design . Because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can Yeah . Yeah b Not on the control , on the screen , on the T_V_ screen . And then
B :  On the screen , you mean ? Not on the control , but on the screen .
B :  Well , this would avoid L_C_D_ , then .
D :  I don't
D :  Oh , I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones . I mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think .
A :  Yeah , yeah . I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh .
B :  W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things . Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So , what are we doing with the settings ? Because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time .
A :  Mm .
B :  Two T_V_s .
D :  I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some
A :  Yeah . Oh yeah . Oh , the .
B :  Like ma
B :  We we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode . Or I dunno . Or like children and grandfather's mode , and the , well the the user
C : 
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  not the user , the man mana T_V_ manager mode . Ah , I dunno .
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So we have five minutes left . Um .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh .
D :  So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required . It's just how to a
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  We should hide them somewhere . In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that .
B :  Hide them , okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Uh , okay , what else ?
B :  Um .
D :  I mean a power button's obviously
B :  Yes . This I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ? Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? Because generally
D :  uh required .
A :  It's it's a kind of setting , I think . It should fit in those settings functions . Because it's not a very current useful function .
C :  Mm .
C :  Settings .
D :  Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off .
B :  Yes .
A :  No , I think it's after after five minutes or something a timer I I think , no ?
B :  Well I I uh
D :  But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute
B :  You don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . Uh probably . Okay , so we should keep this button .
D :  I mean based on our usability studies again , um pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . Um , you know , it was nine out of ten
C :  Yeah .
A :  Oh okay , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will
D :  re relevance .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  turn off the T_V_ . If if you like this ,
D :  Okay .
D :  B Okay .
B :  Because , well it's maybe question for you t
D :  I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , which is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off . Um and all the other f functionality is
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So s yeah .
C :  Yeah , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this . Like covering cu . Yeah , like mobile phone covering .
D :  not used very often .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  On the back , or
B :  Yeah . I mean like the
B :  Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons .
B :  Um , okay , just um the decision of the power button . Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be
A :  For what ?
B :  Uh power button .
D :  I think a button .
C :  A button is better .
D :  I think it should be a bu
A :  Ah oh yeah , yeah . Yeah a button , yeah I guess so .
B :  If it if it's a button or Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Its own button on the front .
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay , one nice big button . Old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
A :  So , any other suggestions or functions ?
D :  What about things like the clock and um timers ?
B :  Do we still have the time ? I I just wonder .
A :  Yeah , we have still one or two minutes to talk , yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Oh . Well what w what was the question ?
C :  Clock or
D :  Uh um , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display
A :  Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions ,
B :  and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , no ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ? I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ?
C :  Mm .
D :  Probably not . It's a questi yeah , it's a trade-off .
A :  This is the question . Is it useful ?
C :  Yes .
A :  W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Ah , yeah .
D :  Okay simple .
B :  Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ , well And based on your
D :  Very , yeah okay , very occasionally . But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah that's okay , that's true . Okay , so no time button . Okay .
A :  No time on .
C :  And uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ?
B :  Yes yes .
A :  I think
C :  I I thin I think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone . It doesn't take that much place and also that much It doesn't cost that much .
B :  Yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life , then . If we use the speech recognition .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time . And uh yeah , now the meeting room is busy . Somebody booked the meeting room just for at one P_M_ , and so we should leave .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh .
A :  So , um . So now we are going for for a small lunch . It's uh funded by the company . And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works . And uh I will do the minutes . And uh
A :  you are going to work on your individual works . And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on . Thank you everybody .
D :  Okay , cool . Okay
C :  Thanks .
D :  Thank you .
A :  Hello , uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control .
D :  Hello .
C :  Hello .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision .
A :  So , uh
A :  we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to
A :  for long discussion and
A :  and decisions . So , who wants to start ?
C :  I s
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
C :  No , no , you you can start .
A :  So start , uh
D :  Okay , I'll start . Can you open my presentation , please .
A :  Uh .
D :  I'm number four .
D :  Trend . Yep .
A :  This one ?
D :  Can you pass the mouse , please . Oh okay , that's fine . Okay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um
A :  Turn .
D :  the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan . Um so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority . Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . So , I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy .
A :  Okay .
D :  Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way .
B :  What does it mean , spongy ?
D :  Uh sort of um squishy . Um . Yeah soft , like a uh like a sponge . I don't know . Yeah . Um so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , um has lots of technolog tech technology in it . Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel . And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . Um .
B :  Like soft , or something ?
A :  Like a sponge . Yeah .
B :  Okay . I will see .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , uh yeah . Easy to use , is it uh
D :  That's it .
A :  a as much as important than technology or fancy thing . It's less important , right ?
D :  Less important . So um fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , and half important as technology is easy to use . So .
A :  Yeah yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  So , Hamed , can you .
C :  Yeah . The second one . Could you please show the presentation number three .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature . We'll see .
A :  Um . Number ? Three .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Three .
A :  This one ?
C :  Yes .
C :  Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second .
C :  Uh , n n no , it's the first one . The second one .
A :  So it's not this one .
C :  Uh yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . Um generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control .
C :  Okay . So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand . It should not be completely like uh a cube . It should be it should have round edge , so uh then it's easier . And maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy .
B :  Exactly .
C :  Okay . And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this .
C :  Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . Not on remote control . I dunno if I can explain well . But uh just inside . For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . So it can be another uh preference . And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it .
C :  Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something . Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or .
C :  Okay . That's mine .
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh okay , so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I'm person two .
B :  And which one , uh probably the first one . I'm not sure but check the first one .
B :  I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but Yeah , that's it . Just
A :  This one , yeah .
B :  It's only this slide ? Yeah . This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this , that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just Yeah , seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme . This is this is the stuff that I can use to Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view .
D :  Inch .
A :  Oh , .
A :  Oops .
B :  Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . So there will be some circuit uh for the power .
B :  So , say power circuit here . Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . So no problem . There can be also solar cell . Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . So at least seven to seven .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is uh seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . It doesn't matter . Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . So this will be T_F_T_ . And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere ,
B :  say here . Interface to the microphone . Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So infra-red here . So the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . Um I have to check what I wanted to
B :  Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device .
A :  Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem .
B :  A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . But we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , I dunno .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay . So
C :  Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside .
A :  Okay . Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around . maybe after .
B :  Well , it's maybe related to the U_I_ . A Yeah , that's all from me .
D :  So
A :  Yeah .
D :  Can I ask a question .
D :  This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , how big is it in reality ?
B :  Yeah ?
B :  Well , seven to seven inches .
D :  So like that .
B :  Yes .
D :  That's quite big .
D :  Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ?
A :  No , I don't think it's seven by seven , I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . Yeah . I dunno I dun I dun One each . But , yeah , .
B :  Yeah but
B :  To be honest , I was
D :  But I mean even even that is like this big .
C :  Yeah yes .
C : 
B :  Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , but it's seven inches . But I I think we can we can cut it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  You can cut the T_F_T_ screen .
A :  Let's go .
B :  Yeah , no no problem , because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . So
A :  So let's cut the T_F_T_ .
B :  Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen .
C :  Mm .
D :  Okay , so
B :  So so for the same price we have four screens now .
A :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
A :  These technical engineers , huh .
D :  So , what's the size of the device ?
B :  Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something .
D :  Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still
B :  Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know .
D :  Is it Can you hold that , or ?
B :  Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know .
A :  What user wants . He wants a small remote control , or ? Uh uh with big buttons . It's difficult . A sm
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah , a small c control that they can hold in hand .
B :  I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something .
C :  Yes .
D :  But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ?
B :  W I I think so . I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah , but
A :  So maybe you can finish your presentation , and afterwards we will discuss about all this .
B :  Oh , okay . Okay thanks .
C :  Maybe this .
D :  Okay .
A :  That's it . Okay . So .
A :  No .
A :  Uh , so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . Uh first I think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ?
B :  Not
B :  J uh just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ , so no problem in energy , I think .
A :  Okay . So Okay .
C :  So but
B :  But we have to use the solar cell . Otherwise not .
A :  Uh like but using how many batteries , for example ? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery
B :  Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells .
A :  Okay . Uh one two
B :  So like three to five centimetres , I dunno exactly , but .
A :  Okay .
D :  So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ?
B :  Uh d doesn't need to be sun . It it's just the daylight , you know .
D :  Okay .
A :  The television lights .
B :  Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . I dunno .
B :  Yeah from the T_ I don't think it's enough , uh .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Mm .
B :  Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ?
A :  At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . Yeah .
D :  It's it's quite innovative , yes .
B :  Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Um .
D :  And if you watch T_V_ outside it's very useful .
A :  So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . Uh what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this um a such a a a screen .
B :  Uh the s the screen is okay , but the board , uh that's the problem .
B :  Well what what would you guess as a shape ? Or what what would be the shape ?
C :  Mm .
C :  I think I think their being uh large or small is not important . The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . So let's say an average size , okay , and it should not be very heavy also . And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . So we c it's like like some joysticks . You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So the general shape should be like this . I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . So uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . It's easier .
B :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Which is the same area .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Could you re could you redesign your board ?
B :  Five to ten . Well that
D :  Oh , five five centimetres by ten centimetres .
B :  Yeah , right . Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one um um How could we do it ? We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . Well But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . Well fi five to ten it would be feasible .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Oh .
A :  I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible .
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . I'll make it .
A :  Okay . So we are agree with a small
C :  Or uh or I don't know but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . Touching the screen . Something like Mm like tactile .
B :  Fo Five by ten .
A :  L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Tactile or something , yeah . Touch screen , yeah .
D :  Mm , touch screen .
C :  So But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , because
A :  Yeah .
A :  The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So
A :  So let's go for a small L_C_D_ .
B :  Okay , so
C :  A smaller s
B :  Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and I will work it out .
A :  Yeah okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  So , five by s ten .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Um so what about , so the case we talked about . Um something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ?
A :  My first idea is because
A :  our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and
B :  Seven to ten banana .
A :  A big banana .
B :  Okay . Rather mango or something or .
A :  Um .
D :  Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ?
A :  Yeah . Yeah . But it's just an idea . I dunno what you think about , but
A :  Yeah .
A :  I dunno if it can fit with the technology . You are the specialists of that .
B :  You mean banana .
B :  Well , but
B :  If it's If it If the banana is big enough .
A :  So
B :  Then , yes .
B :  But if you want to look at the screen , no . Well
A :  Yeah , and
C :  I think this is not good .
A :  The screen has to be square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves .
B :  Well , it can be whatever you want . But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .
A :  It could .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  It's like more more expensive to have shape like that . But I don't care . You know , if we fit this requirement .
D :  Well
D :  I'd like a shaped screen . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen .
B :  Okay
A :  Okay okay .
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one . But
A :  Yeah . Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana .
B :  Like modified banana , okay .
B :  Well it we'll stick to banana , or ?
A :  So we are agree with the banana thing ? Okay .
C :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , banana's good . Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-mm .
A :  So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . Everybody's agreed .
C :  Yeah , I think infra-red .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Sure .
A :  Uh , so that's it I think about the concepts . You have other thing to add to this point , or uh no ? So , uh about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons .
A :  I don't know what we are going to do with that . You talked about the buttons on the side
B :  Like like peeling of the banana you s
C :  Yeah , peeling of the banana .
B :  It would be cool , yeah . Peeling of the banana , you know , should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden .
A :  Mm what ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Okay . And you mean the first layer would be spongy . So Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  First layer obviously spo Yeah , w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think .
C :  Uh
A :  Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it .
D :  I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , some
A :  Yeah .
C :  Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . So , something like this .
A :  Yeah , but do you see that as a
A :  rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or .
B :  Well is it possible to make it soft ?
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So I think if it's so then it's cool ?
A :  So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing .
D :  I think for sure . Definitely . The softer the better .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Cool .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Honestly speaking , I cannot imagine it , so far , but it will be terrible .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
B :  Mm .
A :  And setting buttons
A :  hidden in .
A :  Mm , other remarks , or something , or .
A :  Something we didn't talk about yes yet , or .
A :  I think
A :  we are almost there . Uh maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing ,
A :  like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And how
B :  Pof .
D :  We could use Velcro .
A :  Yeah , maybe .
D :  Or uh ma maybe a magnetic
C :  Yes , yeah it's a good idea .
D :  thing .
A :  Ma magnetic oh .
C :  Magnetic .
C :  Mm . Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely .
A :  Okay .
C :  And when you try to open it , it will be opened easily . So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana .
A :  Okay .
A :  And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ?
A :  Mm . Likes .
A :  Soft plastic , or
D :  Yeah , I imagine some sort of vinyl thing .
A :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
D :  In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel .
D :  Maybe .
B :  Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept
B :  kept in the shape , we cannot b uh So we need that the that the peeling
B :  I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . So , if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . So that we can reach the energy out of it out of that .
D :  Mm . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and
C :  Mm .
B :  It is possible , but , well if it
D :  And a and a banana .
C :  Mm .
B :  I dunno . I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . But then it must be some window there , you know .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
A :  And something we forgot , maybe , uh about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ?
C :  Yes , I think . I think so .
D :  I think it's important . I think One of our p priorities is tech technology . And
A :  It i Yeah , it seems feasible , and it would be something very great . So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , and we have also the technology thing w will be . And even the easy to use thing , so it will be perfect . So we add also the speech recognition device .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I agree .
A :  So , that great . We have decided everything . And think we are on a good way .
A :  So , um
A :  uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes .
A :  Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device . And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation .
D :  Okay .
A :  So , I hope you can do that in thirty minutes . And uh , yeah , I
A :  uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype , and uh
A :  more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together . And um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on . So thank you all everybody , and see you in thirty minutes .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay . Thank you .
B :  Okay .
C :  Thank you .
