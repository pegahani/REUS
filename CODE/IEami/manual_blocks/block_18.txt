D :  Are you sure I got it all head's kinda small . Okay .
C :  How're we placed in terms of the alright .
D :  We're okay ?
B :  Guess I should probably try to sit up straight .
A :  Like that ? Okay , cool .
D :  We're good ?
B :  Oh , I think mine's fallen off .
C :  It fell
C :  That's why .
D :  I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . Mm . Uh okay .
C :  Ah .
A :  Okay ?
A :  Right , so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . Yeah , PowerPoint . Yeah , well , you know , .
B :  Wow .
D :  Very official .
A :  Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it right .
A :  Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um
A :  We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training .
A :  Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . Um we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I guess you know game or something um in real life um so yeah basically
A :  I want to I'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um y is
D :  You're just gonna believe me , we'll go from there . Fair enough .
A :  Exactly . Um I mean obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know
A :  um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . I mean we'll discuss it but
A :  I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like yeah yeah exactly so , 'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um .
D :  Prove it yeah , okay .
A :  And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um
A :  uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know you can this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ?
B :  Oh yeah , that's fine .
C :  Sure .
D :  Works for me .
A :  Sweet .
A :  Cool . So I guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life I dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website .
B :  Right .
A :  Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something .
A :  So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics .
A :  And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um um the other designer that I can't remember , the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um the Industrial Designer hey right on alright , getting into it um
C :  Mm .
D :  There you go .
A :  to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time .
A :  And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that .
A :  Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the
A :  take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible
A :  um to try t of sync it all up . So that's the detailed design . So it's a three stage kind of thing . Um right so for now just for th the white board um
A :  basically uh just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around
A :  um and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um . Oh , we skipped introductions . Nice .
A :  I'm a excellent Project Manager . Um . I'm Marty , um I went to uni at uh U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology . Um yeah . So
D :  I'm Sarah , I went to Michigan , and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something . Marketing , yeah Expert . Expert . Fine . That's me .
A :  Expert Don't play yourself down .
A :  Expert
C :  I'm Ron . I uh once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the User Interface Designer .
B :  I'm Nathan , I'm from California , and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology .
A :  Where did you go to uni Nathan ? Oh brilliant . Cool . My little brother goes there . Right so desert island discs . Yeah .
B :  U_C_L_A_ . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  So .
D :  So do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us ? I'm waiting to know .
A :  Well I'll t i no no yeah I'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down . See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are , I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but
D :  Uh
D :  Fair enough .
A :  there's some other options , if you're a T_V_ slut like I am like Smallville terrible television show but I happen to love it , it's rubbish but I love it .
D :  Oh , Smallville . I went to high school with Tom Willing actually .
A :  T the the main c the main character ? Wow .
D :  The guy . Yeah .
A :  Is he a wanker ?
D :  Yeah . Very much so . Hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless .
A :  He looks really tall , like he's gotta be like six six . Yeah . Um okay so I really like Jeff Buckley . You guys heard of Jeff Buckley ? Um that's cool 'cause like not very many people have . Um and um oh well I might as well throw a British person in there um you can't go wrong with Radiohead . It's a r
D :  Yeah . He is a big guy . Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Good call .
A :  Okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises I think . It's kinda weird . Anyway yeah . Yeah , you're like press and it's . Kinda cool . You'll see . Alright so um whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want .
D :  Interesting .
D :  I guess I'll go next then . Okay . Don't wanna lose all my mikes , plugged in here . Okay . This is basically just pen practice huh ? Okay . Oh you're much taller than me so I'm gonna write down here .
C :  Go for it .
A :  Right on .
D :  Um .
D :  Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of , Chris Bathgate , local Michigan folk singer , really lame and uh
A :  Mm .
A :  Nice .
B :  Wow .
D :  uh what else did I bring with me ?
D :  Probably classical , to totally geek it out , yeah I think .
A :  Okay yeah yeah .
D :  And my family guy D_V_D_s but we don't need to write that one down . So yeah .
A :  Well yeah . Oh , family guy . Isn't h has h do you watch the new season ?
D :  No . Are you getting it online , or is it on sky ? Yeah , that'd be nice .
A :  I think I'm gonna start downloading it yeah .
C :  Alright . Think I'm just gonna put down one uh one C_D_ .
C :  Anybody ? No ? no ? Afro beat orchestra , very cool . Yeah . Fift S they like fifteen members from Brooklyn . Um and I'm hoping to go to the concert in Belgium , in Brussels in April first . Yeah . It's supposed to be in Brussels anyways . Um thing I love about Edinburgh
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  No .
D :  'Fraid not .
A :  Afro beat orchestra ? Very cool . Mm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Sounds nice .
A :  Wow .
D :  Exciting .
D :  That'd be .
D :  Oh . I didn't even read those .
D :  Oops . I shouldn't admit that .
A :  That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for . It's they're designed specifically to ignore . I it's th brilliant .
B :  Oh , wow .
D :  Yeah . It's the five by five , I can't read that much .
A :  Ah yes yes yes okay I see that . Vomit . Yes . Street pizza . It's so brilliant .
D :  Yeah oh it's so horrible .
C :  Love um
A :  I've seen more urine in this city than ever before , I mean
D :  Oh my God . Seriously ?
C :  I just came from Glasgow and I'm um happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately . Um . I w
B :  There's more vomit there .
A :  It's so minging .
D :  It really is
A :  Uh .
C :  Does uh yeah . Ready ? Minging ? Nice .
B :  Alright . Yep .
D :  Yeah . Slide it in there . Yeah .
A :  I'm going local . Going local . I have to be here for three years so I might as well get the terminology right .
D :  Yeah fair enough .
D :  I've already got more than I can keep track of . And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people , no .
A :  Oh , have you been home yet ? They'll be like , say something British , and you're like oh shut up family .
D :  I know . I know . Oh it should be interesting . Wait until I tell them I'm not coming back .
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  Um
B :  Let's see .
A :  Right you s you're gonna stay here ?
D :  They're gonna love that one .
D :  Probably . Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide .
A :  Wow .
C :  Nice .
D :  'Cause nice .
A :  Bad religion ?
B :  Yeah , that's the music I grew up listening to .
D :  Of course .
A :  Yeah yeah , yeah .
D :  Oh , now I can think of so many other ones .
B :  And so there
A :  Well yeah that's why yeah .
D :  That's how it works .
B :  Something I miss about my hometown .
A :  I miss coffee . Burritos .
D :  Mm . Oh
C :  Nice .
B :  that cost less than eight Pounds .
D :  Any thing that are like free .
A :  Oh yeah two two bucks .
A :  Where are you from in California by the way ?
B :  I grew up in San Diego , but yeah um La Jolla , P_B_ .
A :  Did you really ? What part ?
A :  Yeah I'm from San Diego as well .
D :  Nice .
A :  Yeah oh man .
B :  But really uh I last lived in San Francisco , I haven't lived in Cali well I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen .
A :  Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego .
B :  It's different . 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them .
D :  It must make all the difference .
B :  Yeah , it really does .
A :  Well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it like I when I went to school in the U_ in Santa Barbara which is central California
D :  Ah .
A :  the Mexican food is okay , it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks , like literally two bucks for this massive I miss yeah good call on that .
B :  Mm .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah . Where you from in San Diego ?
D :  Mm .
A :  Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego , I live like five minutes from the zoo . So North Park actually if you want to get real specific .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , my grandparents lived on um thirty second .
A :  Yep .
B :  Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is , and
A :  Yes . On university , yeah . Yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house . Yeah , pretty cool . Small world as we were discussing before .
B :  Cafe Forte
B :  Cool .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Especially when we're all from the same general region . Right so okay , success on the whiteboard . You can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s and things we like about the city you know , I think we'll
D :  There you go .
B :  Wow .
A :  Um right so moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance . Um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . Um .
A :  This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ but I don't know , I'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , I mean twenty f that's like you know
A :  forty bucks for a remote . It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . Um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it .
D :  Mm .
A :  Eur internationally . So um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um so something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s but um you know I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing .
D :  Makes sense .
D :  Uh .
A :  Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty . So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can .
A :  Um s right so um just to close up , I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager , sorted . Um .
A :  Is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it .
A :  Um U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do .
A :  Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want . So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , you know like uh so
D :  What they're looking for .
D :  And negotiate that . Uh .
A :  yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email . But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um
A :  and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth . Um any questions , before we get started ?
C :  I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control , we can't kind of build it into other uh products .
A :  You mean to like
C :  For instance like a mobile phone or something like that .
B :  Mm . Sounds interesting .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I don't think there's any rules about it yet . So
B :  Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ?
D :  Mm .
A :  Well , have a think about it . I mean I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able isn't it . I mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function . The clapper . No I mean no , good idea , good idea . We'll see what see what
C :  Yep . Okay .
D :  W yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . Yeah .
C :  Nice . Hot .
D :  I like the little cover thingies .
A :  Uh-huh y I like that
A :  Yeah . That's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to um
A :  I don't really have any . Let me bring up something about
A :  our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . Uh project announcement .
A :  Ts ts ts
A :  Yeah . Not so much .
D :  Hmm .
A :  All right we'll find them , we're on our own .
C :  Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ?
A :  Yeah yeah let's do it , let's do .
C :  S does anybody have any initial ideas ?
A :  I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause
D :  Good idea . Start your minutes . Um
A :  Yeah I mean oh yeah right . So initial ideas .
D :  Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal right , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things ,
A :  Yeah .
D :  as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing , but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons , you can't tell what they do .
B :  Yeah .
B :  S smaller's better . Simple .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things .
D :  Specific .
D :  Okay .
B :  Oh right . That'd be different .
D :  Interesting .
A :  Yeah that's slick isn't it . I mean like stylist yeah like a just a yeah . Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect . Um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um uh size and functionality . Um and we also
D :  True .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm . Right . We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart , that whole yeah .
B :  Yeah . It's gonna be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things .
C :  Too confusing .
A :  I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea of um so you like maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote ?
D :  Hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm . Possibly .
D :  Mm .
A :  I don't think one exists . Be a good idea .
D :  An interesting option .
B :  Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Definitely .
A :  Yeah all the other universal remotes . Um I don't know if there's such a thing out there , I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL , N_T_S_C_ , region one
D :  Right .
C :  I'm pretty sure there is . I mean I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it'll figure out the the specifications of it and will control it um so I th I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  That
D :  Yeah .
A :  Interesting . Okay .
D :  Awesome .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Um all right . So . I li I'm liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features . Um .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right .
A :  Um .
A :  Let's see .
B :  I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah . Keeping it nice and slick , would be important . And
D :  I don't know , like , there's such a problem with losing them , that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , so we're gonna have to be careful with what like
B :  Mm .
C :  Oh .
D :  Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool .
A :  Uh let's see . Um .
C :  I like the idea of the uh multi plate . In in
A :  Yeah yeah okay .
D :  Yeah . Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ? Isn't there a name for them ? Are they ? I dunno .
A :  Think they're just called face plates ? I don't know .
B :  something , uh we'll have to come up with a name , patent it .
C :  I like . We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . For those cold winter days .
D :  Yeah . Something really cool .
D :  Leopard print or something .
B :  Leopard print .
A :  Um .
D :  Hmm .
B :  I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .
D :  True .
A :  Mm . But if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote .
D :  Right .
B :  Mm .
A :  Um
C :  Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it . If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying .
B :  True .
D :  True .
D :  Right .
A :  Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes , could we do something like that ?
D :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
B :  I think so .
C :  That's cool .
D :  Probably .
C :  I think we could design into that .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Good .
A :  Um yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah . And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Curves .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price .
D :  Right .
A :  Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know m massive , some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  Definitely .
A :  But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it and um
D :  Yeah .
D :  Or if you our users in mind , like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , and who we're gonna be able to get it out of .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  'S true .
D :  But
C :  We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ?
D :  Euros .
A :  Twenty five Euros .
C :  Slight difference I guess .
A :  Yeah . They're all weaker than they're all stronger than the Dollar .
A :  Although , computer parts , all if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . Like um do you guys know Fry's ? Huge computer uh electronics store ?
D :  Mm .
C :  No .
D :  Mm-mm .
A :  They serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about .
D :  Mm .
A :  Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  And uh right so thanks for that . Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into .
D :  With half an hour ?
A :  Um . Yes .
D :  'Kay . Perfect .
A :  Thanks guys .
D :  Cool .
C :  Thank you .
B :  Alright .
A :  All set ?
A :  Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion .
A :  So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be a television remote . Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it . Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design .
A :  For reasons that I don't really know . There's but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh um
A :  well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on
B :  Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ?
D :  Gotta plug you in .
A :  Oh , right yeah .
A :  Yep .
A :  Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up .
A :  Yep . Cool .
B :  Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation . So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well .
A :  Brilliant .
D :  Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely .
B :  So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means . Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range . Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , 'cause we were thinking
A :  Mm .
A :  'Kay . Fair enough .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Fine .
A :  Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?
D :  It needs , yeah .
B :  Right .
B :  Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .
A :  Okay , okay .
B :  That's the end of my presentation .
D :  Cool .
A :  Great .
A :  Thank you very much Nathan . Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .
A :  S plug yourself in here .
A :  Mm .
A :  Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down
A :  Mm .
D :  Looks like you're in okay .
B :  Is it plugged in well ?
B :  There it goes . Computer adjusting .
D :  There you go .
A :  There you go . Sweet .
C :  Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem . Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh
A :  Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before .
C :  quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . Um now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it .
A :  Oh yeah look at that .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  As you also notice it's quite a boring design . Um . Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring .
C :  So my personal preferences . Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there . Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh .
A :  Nice .
A :  Okay .
A :  Great . Thanks for that Ron .
D :  Right .
A :  'Kay yep that's you .
D :  Does that mean I'm up ? I think so . Okay . Oh that would be perfect . Thank you .
C :  I can plug you in .
D :  Slide show up and running .
D :  Or not . Uh .
A :  Give it a little bit .
D :  Oh there we go . Perfect .
D :  Okay . So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with .
D :  And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are
D :  the standards . So it's a good start for us .
A :  That's great . Thank you Sarah . Right . So um yep I'll just uh switch that back here . I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase .
D :  Need to unplug this ?
D :  Need it back .
D :  There you go .
A :  Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um .
D :  Oh right .
D :  We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so .
A :  Yes . So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So
D :  Right .
A :  uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well , we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um , which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly .
D :  Right .
D :  Uh .
A :  Um so um .
A :  How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see . Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say um volume up .
D :  Right .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Right . I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology .
A :  Mm .
D :  Oh . That could work . I like that .
B :  With a simple command like locate . And then it could start to beep and
D :  Yeah . Something very basic .
D :  Right .
A :  Right .
B :  therefore be found .
C :  Sounds good .
D :  Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ?
B :  Oh yeah I think that's very doable .
D :  Okay .
A :  The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . 'Kay you have something that picks up
B :  Mm .
A :  a voice from far away
D :  Yeah .
B :  It's a good point .
A :  If it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too .
C :  A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . And you just say something to into that and it
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  finds your
D :  K
A :  Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing but yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system .
D :  Yeah .
C :  The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not .
D :  True .
D :  Making it just an option ? Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Right .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I was thinking uh
D :  Are we still thinking about this screen sorry . Go ahead .
B :  Oh go ahead .
D :  The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ? Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  'S definitely an option technically . I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point .
D :  Okay .
D :  We're doing okay .
D :  'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have
A :  Okay .
D :  menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism . So it's just something to consider .
D :  True .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Worth looking into .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  True .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Absolutely . Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question . Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control . Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many , we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we don't have many um .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I appear to have lost my microphone . Mm .
A :  Right um we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool . Um right . I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . Um .
A :  The thing with I see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ?
C :  Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct , I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . We could have the casing , the the face plates .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm . Just the casing .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Back to the uh the cost the material . We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? That's something I w for say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up . And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ? We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
B :  See if there if there's even interest out there . Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Right .
A :  Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control .
D :  Mm .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home , so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm . Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room . Uh .
D :  True . True . True .
A :  Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um . True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah .
C :  Sure .
C :  Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um
A :  Yeah yeah okay . Um
C :  Interface ?
A :  Yeah I think that would be best . Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic
A :  built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . With a touch screen for the basic functions . Um
A :  And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . Um do we have
A :  Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls .
A :  Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost .
D :  True .
D :  'Cause it would have a docking base ?
A :  Mm-hmm . But then again that costs as well . Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ?
A :  Do they ? Okay .
C :  Those new ones .
D :  Can we afford that ?
B :  Can we afford to include one of those ?
D :  And will somebody buy it if we don't ?
A :  Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . Okay so let's go with a um touch screen
D :  Right .
A :  with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology
D :  For twelve Euros ?
A :  Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple you know so you know . Well yeah I mean you can put the we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics . Okay so we'll touch screen and the battery , focus on um uh presentation .
D :  It is .
D :  Fair enough .
D :  The basics .
D :  Mm .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um
B :  Right .
A :  and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this .
B :  Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .
C :  Be interesting .
D :  Mm .
B :  What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um
D :  And oh . Yeah the the fashion do . Yeah .
B :  logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said .
C :  We put fashion into electronics .
A :  W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . Yeah I think perhaps good idea but yeah I think that that one m might just be um
D :  Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and
B :  'S too much .
D :  Yeah .
A :  and they just yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular a P_D_A_ would they would makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but
D :  For now .
A :  I dunno , what do you guys think ?
B :  Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . That'd be okay .
D :  Yeah . Nice .
C :  Yeah . Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device .
D :  Um .
D :  Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .
B :  Mm . True .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Y
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah you would think . But .
A :  But apparently not . So .
B :  People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . They just want it to be on and ready to go .
D :  If it comes from above .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Kind of if i
C :  Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . Yep . Goes into a sleep mode .
D :  Mm .
A :  Oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode . Okay . Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um .
A :  Um cool so any last things before we break ?
A :  Alright . Fair enough .
A :  Sounds good .
D :  We're good ?
A :  I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .
C :  I've put my files in the shared folder as well .
A :  Brilliant .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That's fab guys . Cool .
D :  That went well , thank you .
A :  That's great .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Perfect .
A :  Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up .
A : 
A :  Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
A :  Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um .
A :  So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to . Alright Nathan , take it away .
B :  I'll go first .
D :  Go ahead .
A :  It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? Good .
B :  No Nathan's fine . It's either Nathan or participant two .
C :  Mister participant two that is .
B :  Uh .
D :  Nice .
B :  Okay . Um , basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , so Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that .
A :  Nice .
A :  Mm .
B :  Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon .
B :  Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . So we'll have to look into that .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .
A :  What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?
B :  Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of
B :  three or four millimetres . Yeah .
A :  Okay , brilliant .
B :  Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . Um and just a little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Right .
D :  Right . Nice .
B :  Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light .
B :  Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Interesting .
A :  M Maybe is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like
D :  Mm . Good call .
B :  Yeah . I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course
D :  Choose it .
A :  Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .
B :  Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?
C :  Interesting question .
B :  'S a bit of a challenge question .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yes .
D :  Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?
A :  Mm .
B :  Right , that's my concern too .
B :  Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes .
B :  So we're not so confined by one style and say some you know , say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation .
D :  Right .
A :  Mm . Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ?
D :  Right .
D :  Um
D :  It's an option , uh but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand , it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway .
A :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Okay , perfect . Great , thank you very much Nathan . That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here .
B :  Oh yeah , you're welcome .
D :  I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things .
C :  Did you ?
D :  You waiting for me ? I know , what a teaser ain't it . Um . Right .
A :  Fascinating , compelling even .
D :  So current market trends .
D :  Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .
D :  Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,
B :  Mm .
D :  v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be
A :  Tomatoes .
D :  a different shape or okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , uh not something I I've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh
B :  Mm .
C :  I like it , I like it .
D :  not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something
B :  Hmm .
B :  I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , it has a consistency of those stress balls .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yes .
D :  Mm . Might be an interesting way to go .
A :  Slick , slick .
C :  Fabulous .
D :  Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .
B :  Mm .
D :  Um .
A :  Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um
D :  Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter . 'Cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls .
A :  Mm .
D :  True .
D :  Very true . Very true . Very much so . Um
A :  Yeah , it's like , yep it's ubiquitous isn't it ?
B :  Taped with duck tape and what have you , you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber .
C :  We can have a duck tape casing .
D :  We could . I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , but worth a shot .
C :  It could go with the granola crowd .
D :  Ah , it could be , it could be , um . Yeah that's what I know .
A :  Great , thanks for that Sarah . Ron ?
D :  No problem .
C :  Phew .
C :  Computer's adjusting . One moment please . So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .
C :  So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today . I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look . Um , so
A :  Yeah .
C :  the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um .
C :  In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line
D :  Mm .
A :  Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team at the
C :  On the remote control right .
D :  Yeah . Very true , very true .
C :  Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod which I am sure most of you know about . Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , I don't think that's we're necessarily going for . And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  No .
C :  and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .
A :  Yeah , I can see .
C :  Um , again probably not what we're going for so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm , right .
C :  Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so
A :  Mm .
C :  red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank
D :  Mm .
C :  has jokes when it's ready .
D :  Nice .
A :  Great .
C :  And uh that is about it .
A :  Great , wonderful Ron , cool . Lot of good ideas , good facts to have .
D :  Mm .
A :  That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um .
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?
D :  I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places .
A :  'Kay .
D :  But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then right ?
A :  'Kay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , yeah that's just an estimate though .
A :  To produce each one .
D :  Per ?
D :  Piece .
C :  Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects .
D :  I know
A :  Mm .
C :  You industrial designers .
B :  I know . It's fun .
A :  Hmm .
D :  And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? Do we remember ?
A :  Well .
B :  I thought there was some flexibility with that .
D :  Okay .
A :  There is , it's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five .
D :  Can we justify it ?
D :  Right .
A :  So
C :  Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?
B :  That's just off the top of my head , it is pending further emails .
D : 
A :  From the board , um , well
B :  Right .
D :  Though I think that's what people would pay for , I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something
A :  That's true , I mean
B :  It is the new it would be in a class of its own .
D :  Yeah .
A :  And that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros , so
D :  Right .
A :  we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh
D :  See if we can cut some corners .
D :  Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It's true . We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on
D :  Right .
D :  It's a starting point anyway , so .
A :  No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here .
D :  Mm .
A :  So
C :  I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition
D :  Yeah 'cause with voice recognition
D :  I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote .
A :  The voice rec thing , I mean , if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , I think we might have to drop the voice rec .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely .
A :  Yeah .
C :  To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice we're using it for our coffee machines already .
D :  Price-wise .
D :  True . We've already got it .
C :  I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall . Sounds good .
A :  Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ?
B :  I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . It would be very nice .
D :  Pretty much .
C :  I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say .
D :  Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell
D :  is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups . Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Does having both really up our costs ?
A :  I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . You know , you can't you can't have all three . It's just impossible .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um .
A :  Otherwise , yeah , we just it just becomes cost prohibitive . What which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ?
D :  Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know
D :  fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model .
B :  I would have to side with that , I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's
A :  'Kay .
A :  What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ?
C :  Well my p is
A :  Nathan ?
D :  Mm .
B :  Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean .
A :  Mm .
D :  Right .
A :  Right .
D :  Right .
C :  Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment .
D :  And we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , we can stick with what we've already got .
A :  Mm .
D :  In a lot other ways too .
A :  Okay . So I'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay . Yeah .
D :  I think it's our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option .
A :  Okay . Sorted . We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .
C :  It's you and me outside a little here .
D :  So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right ?
A :  Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
D :  Okay .
B :  Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ? Okay .
A :  Yes .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um . You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?
B :  Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to
D :  Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement , like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably
A :  Mm . Yep .
B :  It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , and you know how those those don't really require that much light , um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything .
C :  Calculator .
D :  Yeah . True . True .
D :  Right .
A :  Right .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . What do you think Ron ?
C :  I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh
A :  Hmm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Interesting .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? What's the uh idea ?
C :  Just a thought .
C :  Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .
D :  I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .
D :  True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , right .
A :  Well we have to have buttons on it too as well . But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers . I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right .
D :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
D :  With the bu yeah .
A :  And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out .
B :  I think , I think you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good , even though and hand-held the same time .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  True .
D :  Way to go .
C :  I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things .
D :  Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal , you know like that little pod looking thing ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , those are nice .
C :  Exactly .
A :  Yeah , I mean a nice although we do um wh uh is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um
D :  Right .
B :  Mm .
D :  That would be kinda neat .
D :  Terracotta bowl or something .
A :  Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines . Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel , um you know li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit . You know something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .
D :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
B :  Just kind of the squishy feel .
D :  Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .
D :  Right .
A :  Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good . Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um .
D :  Handy .
B :  Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers and I'm just having to guess .
D :  Okay .
A :  We'll have more of an idea when the prototype
A :  have more of a we'll have more of an idea later on . Um . And we just yeah go from there . Um , so we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .
D :  Mm .
D :  Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be
B :  Right .
A :  Like maybe have menu things .
D :  Take precedence , yeah .
B :  If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .
D :  Right .
A :  Mm .
D :  And they slide .
A :  Yes .
D :  Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p
C :  Think then we're hitting our cost issue again .
D :  True , we're still not making it easier then .
A :  Yeah we've also got the the me the thing of , if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we yeah . B But no I mean we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .
B :  Yeah .
D :  True .
D :  Fair enough .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah it's just a scroll .
B :  Right .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um
A :  Well it seems like I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case we might as well stick with that um .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Probably .
B :  Right .
C :  I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .
D :  Right .
D :  Mm .
D :  Well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .
B :  Right .
A :  Mm 'kay , um .
A :  We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um . Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population .
D :  Mm .
D :  Right , particularly in technological fields , so that's exactly where we're headed .
A :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um .
A :  Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .
C :  Well what are we actually doing ? What were
A :  Right . I was just gonna step on to um I wasn't ? Oh , my bad um sorry . The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and cool ?
D :  Uh .
D :  Oh it wasn't in the way but yeah , whatever .
D :  No , don't worry about it .
C :  Sure .
D :  Okay .
B :  So have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? Or are we just going to go with one ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
B :  ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well mm . It's a tough situation , but obviously having more cases also costs more so
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something . That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing .
B :  There's an idea .
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  And again copying iMac's kind of for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .
D :  Yeah , get in there .
D :  Yeah , totally .
A :  Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on uh multiple case colours .
A :  But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design .
A :  Cool .
A :  Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh I'd like Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . And um Ron if you can
B :  Right .
A :  figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place .
A :  Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , um using um prototype building materials um . And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?
B :  Oh excellent yeah .
D :  Cool .
B :  That sounds good .
C :  Fabulous .
A :  Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .
D :  Cool .
D :  Okay .
D :  Oh I totally
D :  Yeah 'cause I moved it .
D :  'S put it over here . Then we don't have to worry about it .
C :  Ready for this ?
A :  All set ? Cool .
A :  Alright , it is PowerPoint time .
A :  I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment which is kind of fun .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh man .
A :  So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .
B :  Oh really ? Okay .
A :  I think . I don't know . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it .
D :  Huh .
D :  Yeah that's not you .
A :  No . That's how the
A :  Wait .
A :  This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what
A :  sort of limitations we're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . So .
A :  That's sorted , back to the main
A :  meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys .
B :  Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um .
B :  As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , why not ?
D :  Ah .
A :  Nice .
D :  Fair enough .
B :  Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .
A :  Perfect .
C :  No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity if you will . Um . Right , um , of course that's uh interchangeable and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption .
B :  Go ahead .
D :  Mm .
D :  Right .
D :  Appropriate , okay .
D :  Mm 'kay .
D :  It is an option .
A :  Oh , right .
B :  That's this here .
D :  Ah . I see .
C :  Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ?
B :  Um I worried about the materials , it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped .
B :  Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .
C :  It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside .
B :  Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen , I thought that was kinda nice . This was actually an apple on the inside . This
A :  Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok
D :  Nice .
D :  Do we need to worry about um rot factors ?
C :  Um it's encased in a new uh type of uh
D :  Oh okay , there's preservatives involved , we don't need to worry , okay .
B :  Yeah . We got a bit ahead of ourselves , I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but
C :  polymer yeah . It's fine .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Fair enough .
A :  Edible televisions , it's a wave of the future .
D :  No but
C :  It's pos a possible new product . Um , but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . Um , did we come in under budget ?
D :  It's a couple years off at least .
D :  Okay .
A :  Brilliant .
B :  Right .
B :  Uh we did , yeah . This cost well to put this into um production , we're looking at about what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .
B :  Um , so I was quite pleased with that . One thing that we didn't do um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down . So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Brilliant .
D :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
C :  Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ?
B :  And
B :  Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ?
C :  So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier and um , I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not . And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm 'kay .
B :  Hmm . Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  Cool .
B :  Any questions ?
A :  No , no I think that's
D :  Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ?
B :  Um , do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it ?
D :  Do we know where we stand on that yet ?
C :  Well we didn't quite have enough material uh .
D :  Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Oh I see , right , um .
B :  Um , well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like
D :  Okay .
D :  Just veneer really , yeah . Okay .
C :  Right . Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . So I mean there are I we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials which I think worked out fine . We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And the whole thing
D :  Okay .
D :  Right .
D :  Yeah . There's
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Okay , very cool .
B :  It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if you know what I mean .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yep . It's still an option if we need it . Very cool , nice job .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right , yeah thanks guys that's very , very good work . I like it , brilliant .
A :  Um , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um . I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like
B :  Oh .
B :  Ooh .
A :  So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this it's a solar cell thing right ?
B :  Right uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , yep .
A :  With a back-up battery ?
A :  With the ba okay . Um and
C :  The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah .
A :  Clever , clever , well done . Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um
A :  It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ?
B :  Yeah , yeah . It's just making use of the same space and the same materials , but
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that be the general
B :  Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . Um . Push button interface
A :  um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ?
B :  Yeah , mm-hmm .
A :  Um .
A :  And um a special
A :  I guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout , yeah .
B :  Yeah , special . And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , I like to think of it as unconventional .
A :  Yeah , it's it's quite unique . I like it , yeah it's
A :  So it looks like
D :  M come in at sixteen ?
A :  a bit over budget , um .
B :  Oh . Huh , doesn't match up does it ?
A :  So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells
A :  um or take out the back-up battery . Uh
B :  How do you feel about that ?
C :  I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working what am I gonna do ? People'd be real upset . I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm k .
D :  True .
A :  Hmm .
A :  What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to
D :  Nah .
A :  square one
A :  in a way . Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly .
B :  Hmm .
C :  I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean that's what sets us apart right ?
D :  I mean
D :  Which , it's yeah that's what setting us into this young market , I mean that's where we started from , so
D :  I don't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league .
B :  Right .
C :  And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell .
D :  Right .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
A :  It's either or .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . I guess we might have to do that . It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it ? Of twelve fifty .
D :  I think unfortunately that's our best option .
D :  Mm .
A :  'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're um and we can't get rid of the uh I mean removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of a
D :  It kind of yeah .
B :  Yeah , .
C :  Savings .
A :  mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials .
D :  Mm-mm .
A :  Um . So yeah that looks like to be the only thing . So that would be the it's a major change but
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Alright , so we're in agreement on that .
B :  Gotta do what you gotta do .
D :  Unfortunately I think we are .
C :  No , I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah .
A :  Right .
A :  Moving along swiftly . Um , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation
A :  which I will allow Sarah to take over .
D :  That would be me . Um cord ?
A :  Ah of course , sorry .
D :  No problem .
A :  Whoosh .
D :  Can you reach , that would be great , thank you .
C :  Yep .
A :  That'd be great
D :  I didn't even do that one on purpose either , damn . Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important . Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um .
D :  Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . So I think overall we're headed in the right direction .
B :  Mm .
B :  Really good .
D :  So .
C :  They like that spongy feel .
D :  Yeah . It looks like it's going over well , so
C :  And the paging function works well , that's good to hear , we worked hard on that one .
B :  Six ?
D :  we're we're good yeah . Yeah . It's I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good .
B :  We did .
A :  Brilliant .
B :  I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it's okay .
D :  That's everything from me .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , it is a set-back , but
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay , do you need the cord back ?
C :  W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again that we're
A :  Um yeah , I was just go on .
B :  I know .
A :  Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ?
C :  I guess that's true .
B :  True .
A :  Right . So , um , this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to . Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um and that is gonna go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um .
B :  Okay .
D :  As in within the team or ?
A :  I think so yeah .
B :  Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or
D :  Okay .
A :  I think it's
A :  I mm-hmm , I think so .
B :  'Kay .
A :  I think hope I'm not screwing up an experiment .
D :  It is now , you're in charge so there you go .
A :  But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . Um right , um so any thoughts ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Whatever .
B :  Are we considering these points here ? Okay .
D :  Um .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I think they're starting blocks yeah .
A :  What do you guys feel about the process ?
D :  Um , you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , considering the little amount of input we had going in . Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  We didn't use the whiteboard at all .
D :  No , we didn't . We could now if that'd make up for it but really and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter .
B :  No .
A :  No , no whiteboard .
C :  And
C :  Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything .
D :  Yeah I think I was taking notes more often than usual just 'cause I liked the pen , yeah .
B :  Yeah , it's true .
B :  Mm .
C :  Uh .
A :  Was pretty cool tack though .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Definitely .
D :  Mm . I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach .
B :  As you write your personal coach .
D :  Yeah , but I didn't get a response so we'll see .
B :  What if you get a response two or three months from now ? That'd be weird .
D :  Okay that would be kinda creepy .
A :  Attempts to contact coach ineffective .
D :  Well what kind of coaching is that really ? What if I really needed something .
C :  I so I don't n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um .
D :  I think so .
D :  And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be .
C :  With the natural look .
B :  Yeah .
B :  That's very natural .
A :  Very natural look .
D :  Organic , really . And highly resourceful team mates might I add which is always a plus .
A :  That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean .
C :  I think the teamwork was good as well .
D :  Mm yeah , I'm impressed .
B :  And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit .
D :  Nice . All four of those little containers .
A :  Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern .
B :  Yeah , I guess
B :  My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , we only had four , wasn't enough .
D :  Yeah . You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours .
B :  I know it could have been amazing .
D :  Oh well .
A :  What did you guys think about the the the roles ?
B :  Hmm .
D :  They were good .
B :  Yeah it's f kind of fun , it was
D :  Yeah .
B :  I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , which was kind of fun .
D :  True .
D :  Do your own . Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . Nothing , I didn't even get an email , like that was it .
A :  That's true , I I got this spreadsheet .
D :  So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . Whatever .
C :  Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about uh but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , which was fine .
A :  Of what to do .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh-huh , that wasn't very much .
B :  You know
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
A :  Mm , mm .
D :  Hmm , very much so .
B :  Yeah . That was fun . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot .
D :  Very much so .
A :  Cool .
C :  And I think your leadership was quite good .
D :  Hmm .
B :  It was really good yeah .
A :  She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  That's kind of a good thing though , you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey .
A :  I felt like I slipped into it a lot .
B :  It's kinda fun .
A :  I dunno .
C :  An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ?
A :  The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . I usually organise crap , it's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , you know ?
D :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Little different .
A :  But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ?
D :  Yeah . I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , other than that
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  I had to admit , as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window .
D :  I could only imagine .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos everybody knows best spaceships ever . Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ?
C :  Possibly .
C :  Oh yeah , still have 'em .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Totally .
B :  Yeah ?
D :  I think so .
C :  Yep .
A :  Hmm .
B :  You don't .
A :  No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , I don't I I was just I
D :  Though we didn't actually I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings .
B :  Yeah .
A :  It's true huh ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  I mean I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team .
D :  That's true .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like , kind of like , like hmm . It d
D :  Yeah that is kind of
A :  But yeah . Interesting . It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ? I mean the whole process of
B :  Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ?
A :  I don't know . I I don't know if there was a ri I th
D :  Mine was the mics . I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , I was afraid I was gonna break something actually .
B :  Yeah , that's it 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board .
D :  Yeah .
D :  True , but it didn't even occur to me as an option , I mean I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't .
A :  Nor I .
C :  I mean it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . Um , because I've got this laptop . Standard , I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me .
D :  True .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I wanna see the output files from these um , from the digital paper . I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap . I mean , just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something .
D :  Well it looks really professional .
D :  I know .
B :  Yeah , that's it .
B :  Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because
D :  I know , I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do .
A :  T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . You know , like what is the uh
A :  what exactly we're looking for here .
C :  So is this all we need to get through ?
D :  I guess .
A :  I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about .
D :  Um . It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ?
B :  New ideas .
C :  Is it
A :  Well , that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , mm-hmm . I didn't change this one at all .
D :  That slide was like that ?
B :  Hmm .
D :  Well .
B :  I guess we're on the right track .
A :  Um ch
A :  Yeah well .
C :  Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ?
A :  W I kinda like th
B :  No , none .
D :  Uh I think they still do their job .
B :  I think they're fine actually .
A :  Yeah you can't
D :  I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form I don't
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , maybe a s a circle would be alright , different .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Does kinda make you wonder , I mean , how much can you do with a remote control ? It's like inventing a new car . Yeah yeah , you can
D :  It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road , you know ?
A :  Yeah .
D :  Don't know .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Um . 'Kay .
C :  What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ?
D :  Kind of .
A :  So this was other costs .
B :  Are we back into project mood ?
A :  I dunno . I think this is
D :  Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ? How much time do we have left ?
A :  forty ish I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval , um .
A :  I dunno about you guys but I felt like
A :  a bit
A :  under-stimulated on the whole thing . Like , what like you know what am I really doing , you know what is
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway so type away . You know , you know what I mean like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore .
A :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Why ? Huh I think it was the real .
A :  Hey .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Whatever . Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Very much , yeah .
A :  I actually didn't do that at all though , every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em . I di
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Oh I added like five slides too , but I
D :  See I only got blank ones .
A :  Oh .
B :  Did you really ? I just got blank ones and
A :  What ? Really ?
D :  My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe and they were just empty .
C :  Yeah , mine too .
B :  Me too .
A :  Did they not have they didn't like uh mine yeah they didn't come like this ? Like with this was what it looks like . This is what that looked like , literally , just like that . Interesting .
D :  Like with those words already on it ?
D :  No .
C :  No .
D :  I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated .
A :  Uh-huh huh huh .
B :  I deleted slides .
D :  I think I added a slide one time .
C :  I added many slides every time Yeah .
D :  Hey with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class .
B :  That was pretty cool , it was a high moment of the whole experiment .
D :  Mm .
C :  Um .
A :  Interesting .
A :  Any other thoughts come to mind ?
D :  I wanna know how our product would fare . I can't just leave it there . I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . But you know the whole
B :  I think it would fail , I think
B :  it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that .
C :  Even you .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I don't we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face .
D :  I know it is .
A :  Yeah but
