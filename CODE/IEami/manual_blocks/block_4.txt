A :  So we can start ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Suppose I have to do my presentation . Eh um
C :  Ah okay .
C :  It's Ada Longmund ?
A :  So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager .
A :  So um we will have to
A :  um speak about m the project . Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly .
A :  Record .
A :  So the project method is the following .
A :  So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design .
A :  Uh .
A :  The tool training is to try out the white board , so
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard , yeah ?
A :  Maybe you can draw your favourite animal
A :  and make a list of its favourite characteristics .
D :  So right now ?
A :  I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later .
B :  So yeah I think you can do it .
C :  Yeah , I don't know .
A :  So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . Yeah . Yeah . I think it's quite good price , yeah . And uh
B :  Twenty five Euros ?
D :  Mm .
C :  I it's it's reasonable , s quite yeah . Twenty five .
D :  It's reasonable , I think , yeah .
C :  Is
A :  it will uh be a
A :  an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control . Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls , try to create something new and people would like to to buy .
A :  And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes ,
A :  so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do . And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .
C :  Yeah . I I hope so
D :  Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI and okay .
B :  Yep .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I_D_ , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So
C :  I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , yeah ?
D :  Okay .
C :  And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer , yeah ?
B :  That's me .
D :  Okay , and Marketing Expert , it's me .
C :  AMI yeah project .
A :  So I will manage all all the group .
C :  you will be the manager yeah .
D :  You can manage all this , yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Good .
A :  So you have questions ?
D :  Um .
D :  Not really .
A :  So you all know what the parts of the work you have to do .
B :  Yeah .
D :  So which you , the Industrial Designer .
B :  No I'm user interf I'm user interface design .
C :  I am the Industrial Design , yeah
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm . And you ?
C :  I am the Industrial Designer so .
A :  Mm okay .
B :  Okay . So what's the difference between
D :  Yeah .
B :  user interface design d industrial design ?
A :  Hmm .
D :  I mean , you have to know . Ah , you have to know it .
C :  It's difficult .
D :  It's your job , so I hope you you know what it is .
C :  You know very soon .
B :  Yeah , I think so .
C :  So
D :  Mm .
A :  I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it .
B :  Okay , so I make uh u user interface . You you de you implement the core functions in the
D :  Yeah .
A :  And i maybe you will transform it .
C :  I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so
B :  Use it .
B :  Make make yeah .
C :  And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like .
B :  Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design . I design the user f user interface , you design the function .
C :  Yeah . So the materi
A :  Maybe , it is the outside and the inside .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay right . But I was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know .
B :  Yeah yeah .
C :  But I don't know . Okay .
D :  Well . You know .
C :  I'm the industrial designer .
D :  Oh , okay , okay . Not the other one .
C :  So .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  So and the marketing expert will
D :  Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .
A :  And yeah .
C :  Ok Okay .
A :  And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . So you don't have to do something really specific , as everybody everybody will have to use it , it's sor the same as keyboards . You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard , so really the remote control to be international . And not too expensive .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . And uh simple .
A :  As we want to maximise the benefit .
B :  And easy to use .
D :  And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so .
A :  Yeah , you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros .
B :  Ah , yeah .
D :  That's the problem .
C :  It should be
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now .
B :  Okay .
A :  So , is it okay ?
D :  Mm . It's clear .
B :  Yeah .
C :  There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , I don't know .
D :  Yeah , maybe should go and draw an animal .
C :  Is it ? Are we supposed to do right now ?
B :  Yeah yeah , you try . Try first .
C :  Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri It's
A :  So you think we have to do it now ?
C :  I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now .
B :  You can draw something which is very simple .
C :  Oh
A :  You want me to draw something ? Product manager okay , let's go , I will try .
C :  Everybody
B :  Oh , maybe we should bring Kemy here . Kemy is really good at drawing .
D :  Many
C :  I think everybody should do it , so .
D :  Yeah .
C :  It's not matter
C :  So .
B :  You're going to draw ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Uh it's the same as mine .
C :  yeah . It's a It's a cat .
B :  What's this ?
B :  It's a fat cat .
C :  It is not a fat cat .
D :  It's the fat cat , okay .
C :  Yeah , it is a
B :  Can you draw uh um rabbit ? Oh , hat ha rat .
D :  A rat ? That's difficult .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat . It's your rat .
A :  No . A mouse is not too difficult . Mouse is okay .
B :  Yeah , it's okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Just go , you you the closest to the whiteboard .
C :  Okay , go
C :  right , but in grow , it's everybody has to grow
B :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Oh . Okay , I draw . The only thing I can draw is like this .
B :  Oh .
B :  Oh . Oh .
D :  A duck .
B :  No . What's this ?
A :  You love the eyes .
C :  What are you I don no idea , so
A :  Yeah , that was the eyes .
B :  Okay .
A :  A clown . Rabbit .
C :  It's a rabbit .
D :  Pikachu .
A :  It's a rabbit .
D :  Oh yeah .
D :  Bugs Bunny one .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  It's not so bad so .
B :  The only thing I can draw , because it's very simple .
D :  Okay . I go .
A : 
D :  What ? Oh . So what else ? This was my favourite one , but
C :  So you don't have a
A :  Thank you .
C :  A fish .
D :  Right . A fish .
C :  That's a that's a fish ? Okay , let's try to draw something .
A :  You forgot the chips .
D :  Oh yeah , doesn't look so fine .
C :  Have to be really careful .
A :  Fish and chips .
D :  Okay , it's your turn .
C :  Ah it's my turn .
B :  Oh .
B :  Okay , be careful .
C :  Okay .
C :  So .
C :  It's ok So , what can I draw some more ?
B :  No problem , no problem .
A :  Oh . ?
C :  ? No .
C :  Mm
B :  .
C :  Yeah , it's it's a se it's my priority this one .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  A person ?
C :  No .
C :  It's a really crazy dog
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  Dog .
C :  Okay . Transfer . It's a dog in a village .
D :  Good .
B :  Okay .
B : 
C :  So what are you sug going to do now ?
D :  I think it's done .
A :  Yeah , I think yeah .
C :  It's done ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Just have to
B :  So we have break .
A :  present project , discuss a little bit about it .
C :  Oh my God .
D :  Oh , we have twenty five minutes for the meeting .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  So , if you have questions .
B :  Oh .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Know what time is it ?
D :  No .
B :  No .
A :  It's okay ? You know your job ? you know your job ?
C :  Yeah , it's okay .
C :  We have an idea yeah . I have an idea of my job so yeah so . Yeah .
A :  You know your job ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Good .
C :  So , I will open our functional design meeting .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So , I will play role of the secretary .
C :  As also Program Ma Manager . So , we will have the three presentations from the
C :  In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um
B :  Industrial Design .
A :  Marketing Expert .
C :  What's your talk ? Marketing Experts .
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  And after that we uh will have the
C :  new product requirements ,
C :  the decision on the remote control functions ,
C :  and we will
C :  close the meetings after .
C :  Mm so
C :  um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .
D :  Okay .
C :  Um , so you're participant two ?
B :  One one .
D :  No no no .
C :  No you're
D :  One .
C :  No , I'm participant one .
B :  Three three , it's three sorry .
D :  I I think I'm a .
C :  Okay , never mind .
A :  Okay .
C :  'Kay , did you save your presentation ?
D :  In one .
B :  In one , sorry .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Isn't that technical functions ?
A :  No sure .
B :  So you didn't save it maybe .
D :  It's mine .
A :  Uh it's David Jordan . Course .
B :  Alright , so
C :  Name's Jordan .
B :  David Jordan ? Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  so I'll
C :  I let David Jordan do his presentation .
D :  Okay .
A :  No , no .
A :  Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think .
C :  Uh .
B :  Too great for email then .
D :  Okay , so .
D :  The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh I I will focus on user interface design . Um so move to the next slide . As we know our
C :  Mm .
D :  remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture .
D :  There's a lot of functions .
D :  Over , I think over
D :  s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control .
D :  So how can we
D :  um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?
D :  Um , let's move to next slide .
D :  Um .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So I so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface .
D :  A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface .
D :  Um so move to next s slide .
D :  So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller
D :  which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface .
D :  So
D :  That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation .
C :  So you propose to to have the
C :  remote control which will be powerful .
D :  Uh
D :  With sophisticated functions , but with very yeah powerful .
C :  So powerful ,
C :  many functions and very easy to use .
D :  Yes .
D :  Yep .
A :  So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both , I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple and
B :  To merge the two system huh .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  You mean this one ? Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm yep .
B :  But But this is
D :  But if we have very very good user interface
B :  Yeah .
D :  it take less time for user to learn how to use it .
A :  Yeah , and then
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah you maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign .
C :  Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ?
B :  Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that
A :  Oh it should okay , yeah . The user should know .
B :  So .
C :  Yeah um such as maybe the
B :  Yeah . So .
C :  Go on , go back and
B :  Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .
A :  Yeah , that's gonna be the trick .
D :  Yeah , that's my job .
B :  That's your job
D :  That's my job . It's not the easiest I've got to .
B :  It you
C :  So , you will propose us something which is
C :  yeah so powerful and easy to use . Okay .
D :  Yep .
D :  Powerful and easy to use .
A :  Okay .
A :  So that's the point .
D :  Yeah , that's the point .
C :  So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things .
B :  Okay , okay .
C :  So you you're
B :  Participant two .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Um . Okay .
B :  The rationale must be design , or
C :  So , Baba is the uh the Industrial
C :  Designer .
C :  Okay .
B :  So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh
B :  to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based but
A :  Mm .
B :  I propose a nifra infrared base you know , so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know
B :  For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to
A :  True .
C :  So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?
B :  I think it's cheaper than laser , so .
C :  Yeah . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ?
A :  Okay .
C :  Twelve , nearly thirteen , yeah . The cost
A :  What the cost is ? Twelve , twelve a half .
B :  Yeah , I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh
B :  Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  That might just So .
B :  You can go to the next slide . I have some kind of pictures
C :  Okay .
B :  you know , here .
B :  You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .
C :  Yeah .
C :  What is this ?
B :  This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
C :  Okay .
B :  Look .
B :  But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and .
C :  Okay .
B :  So and the next slide , it is the last one it's So it's
B :  I think it should be wire wireless re remote con
B :  Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know
B :  because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you .
B :  Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?
A :  Okay .
A :  What's the average price of this technology then ?
B :  Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the
D :  So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire with remote control ?
B :  You'd yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also .
D :  Okay .
C :  So you think that uh
C :  a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea . No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a
C :  Yeah , but
D :  Wireless remote control .
B :  Yeah , but some pa
A :  I don't think well , yeah , I don't think he would , but in a sense
B :  I always want to have you know , sometime I want to have wire because you know .
C :  Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ?
B :  Uh , I don't think it will be too much .
D :  Okay .
C :  Could you answer please ?
B :  Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know
C :  Okay .
B :  I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so .
C :  Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . As it's yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  The wire ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  True .
C :  I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh that's my job . That's the
C :  Okay , I'm sorry . So
A :  Now the
B :  Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know .
B :  If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some
B :  the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . Right , so .
D :  Okay .
C :  So just think of um the usability . Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?
D :  Design a wireless remote control .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , yeah .
A :  Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True . This you will see in my presentation then .
C :  So I will let you to do your presentation , so .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Which is participant four .
A :  So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh .
A :  We've made a study , so could you go to next slide . Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um ,
A :  and see what was okay or not for them . Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's
C :  You mean the loo the look , the outside ? Okay .
B :  The look , how it look like .
A :  Yeah , the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job , David , maybe .
A :  Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um
A :  actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh
A :  yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um
A :  yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously
A :  it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh
A :  users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .
A :  And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Could you go next slide ?
A :  Uh , so as you said uh , remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So this is from the experiments we've done , so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think .
A :  Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people .
A :  And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .
C :  What is R_S_I_ ?
A :  R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Ah um okay .
A :  Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Functions .
B :  Okay .
A :  So
C :  Mm okay .
C :  And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the
C :  User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? Sure ? Yeah ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think possible . Because we can
D :  We can uh
D :  mix uh several function in one button .
D :  So lets you then you have less buttons . But I'm not sure
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .
A :  Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the
C :  Yeah , I think the
B :  The manuals .
A :  manual . It's
D :  No you you can have a switch menu , so you can
D :  well for example
C :  Yeah , but it has to be intuitive .
D :  Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then
D :  for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . Then you you put the switch button , then it
C :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Okay , but
D :  switch to another category of functions .
D :  Yeah .
D :  For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder .
B :  With a
D :  So there's a different functions , but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder .
D :  So we can has less buttons . But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny . Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know .
C :  Yeah , but
B :  Look fancy .
B :  This is a question that should be asked to the
B :  If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples , so .
A :  Yeah , this is something we sh
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But this was first step and
B :  I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard
A :  This was the first step , yeah .
C :  Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .
A :  Specially distribution , yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , maybe . Yeah , maybe .
C :  If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .
A :  Uh
D :  Yeah , personalised colour . Because you know
C :  Yeah , it will cost little bit more .
D :  Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , some people prefer black remote control .
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so .
C :  And also f
D :  Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , so user can select which colour they prefer , so .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , remember it's twelve Euros .
C :  So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Hmm .
C :  And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So
C :  I think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with uh the other members .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , hmm .
C :  So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ?
A :  Yeah , it's done , just yeah . If we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .
C :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
C :  Mm so
C :  So , I had some
A :  So .
C :  new information about the product requirements , so you will have to
C :  take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  It's is uh
A :  Lame , or
C :  No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , and also the remote control will only be used for television , so
B :  Yep .
C :  for y for you your designing , you're not you won't be uh you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . It's because if we want to
D :  Control .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  to do remote control
D :  Mm .
C :  which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ?
D :  Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost .
C :  So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hm .
C :  So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
C :  of the uh of real reaction
D :  Okay .
C :  and uh also
B :  So .
A :  So has to be yellow .
C :  Yeah . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .
B :  Yellow .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Require lot of requirements , but
D :  Yeah .
B :  For cheap remote control , yeah .
D :  And cheap . A low cost .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so .
B :  This is
A :  I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway . It's maybe more in browsing .
C :  Maybe not , but mayb
B :  Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .
D :  Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it . A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Hm-mm .
D :  It's It's not so uh popular now .
B :  It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know
D :  Mm .
D :  Global , okay .
B :  the global usage , so if people don't have the technology .
C :  So .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So I I so
C :  So everybody is okay with the new requirements ?
D :  As as for the colour , what what do you think ?
C :  I think it has to be yellow .
B :  Yellow ? Do you think that people like the colour yellow ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yellow ? T_V_ remote control ?
C :  Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be . Yeah , so . Doesn't need to be completely yellow , but just mm .
C :  Why you go
C :  It has to be fashion .
D :  Okay .
C :  So you have to
C :  Yeah . It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . Think it's a re reaction remote control , so . And also it has to be attractive , of course , because if you want to sale to sell the remote control .
D :  Okay , okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
C :  It's okay ?
A :  Regarding the first line , what
A :  So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And that's it .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me .
A :  It's already changed for
C :  I think it would be simpler .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  So
C :  I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break .
C :  And you will have in thirty minutes individual work .
C :  Uh
C :  Y you
C :  You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .
B :  Industrial Designer , yeah .
A :  Industrial Designer .
B :  Component component , yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  And Florent to
C :  work my subject . And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay .
C :  It's okay ? I think the um session is closed .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Good .
C :  And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . Not in mine . Should be better .
B :  Okay Okay , that's clear .
D :  Okay . Okay .
A :  So let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . So , as the previous meeting I will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  No y you do the minutes first , or ?
A :  What ?
D :  No ?
A :  I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yep .
A :  So , we'll
A :  S technical accessoire ? Interface ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  No no no . Yeah .
A :  This .
C :  Mm .
C :  So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller .
C :  The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller .
C :  Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions .
C :  Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
B :  A nice one .
C :  attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .
A :  I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive . It's very big , yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's very , you know if you're
C :  Yeah . It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . Or to recognise it , yeah .
A :  Okay . Yeah , why not . We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , so .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart , so maybe we should uh use um uh
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um
C :  With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user .
A :  Okay . Something else ?
C :  Okay . No . There this is the three concepts of our controller . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , so
B :  Yeah . Maybe .
C :  Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . For example , if you cannot find your uh controller , you can just uh just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two .
A :  Yeah , sure .
A :  I That's true .
B :  Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so .
B :  One and
A :  Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  So you can use your gesture . That's no problem .
D :  Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?
A :  Broken arm ?
C :  For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very
D :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
D :  But this this but this would never happen anyway .
C :  Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time .
A :  Why ?
D :  Yeah
A :  If you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme , so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , so .
D :  Yeah , but the
B :  Yeah but Yeah but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the
C :  Yeah , it's very interesting .
D :  Yeah but this
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I don't think it
A :  Yeah , but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . You're not you're not obliged to share it .
B :  That's right .
D :  Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .
A :  Yeah , we can yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , so it's c come to channel three , I don't have to
D :  No .
B :  It's it's
D :  No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .
A :  Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage .
C :  It's advantage .
D :  Yeah .
B :  And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to
A :  Yeah , but one other question . How how much will it cost ?
B :  manual controllers , eh .
B :  No , more expensive maybe .
C :  How much ?
A :  Yeah . Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .
C :  No no we we d we we just are use um
D :  Uh if you if if you use the basic
A :  Some some efficient .
C :  No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .
A :  So you think it won't cost an
A :  Not a lot for us ?
A :  Or ?
C :  Yeah , I think it's uh because uh this technology is uh
C :  um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very
A :  Yeah , but uh uh
C :  it's uh yeah .
D :  But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . Because then you need uh
C :  It's
D :  I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example .
B :  Well y y you have also the language problem , you know when you
C :  No it's uh
C :  Even for the f um because the the vocabulary the
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  'Cause it it have to be universal , so .
A :  Yeah . I agree with uh
C :  The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  remote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're we want to sell it in France .
C :  Yeah .
A :  The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , so .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation
D :  Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or
C :  mechanism . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .
B :  Yeah but you know . The product The pro
B :  It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm , okay .
C :  Yeah , it's
A :  And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?
B :  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah .
B :  But
C :  Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed . So
A :  Yeah , but how will you
B :  Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . If you have the language , you have to develop for each country .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .
B :  Yeah , but for each country you have to do one , because uh the for example for Se
C :  Yeah .
C :  Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to
B :  Oh really ? That's
A :  Oh . Seems to be quite complex .
D :  Yeah , but then w
D :  Yeah , we have to take care of the twelve Euros
C :  No , it's not so complex .
D :  problem .
A :  And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ?
C :  No no no it's not
C :  I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller .
A :  Yeah , but where is the controller ?
D :  Okay .
C :  Where is the controller ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  It's in your family , in your home .
D :  No , but then it's it's like this uh
A :  Yeah , but we're here it's uh an object . But here you say you want to use i uh s technology .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here .
B :  A microphone maybe .
A :  Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . You just want to interact with television .
B :  To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe .
C :  Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you
B :  I if you say one , he switch to channel , yeah .
C :  you use your command and you do s your gesture .
A :  Yeah , but you can lose it .
C :  No no it's n y if you lose it
B :  So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Ah .
D :  But you would still have the buttons . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?
C :  I think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think yeah . You can see they can switch form one modality to another .
D :  Okay , so you yeah .
A :  Yeah , but
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I think so . And maybe it will be quite
C :  No , that's quite inter quite attractive .
B :  But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y
C :  Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem .
D :  Yeah , I dunno .
B :  Yeah but i i
A :  Okay .
C :  We should have confidence in technology .
B :  Yeah , we should .
B :  Uh .
A :  Hmm . So , what do you think ? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .
B :  Mm .
D :  What ?
A :  Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?
D :  If if
D :  I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . But if if if it like doubles uh
C :  More features , yeah .
B :  Yeah , but
B :  I think he need a control that is very reliable , so .
D :  no one would would be interested .
A :  So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller .
A :  Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ?
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .
C :  Yeah but if if you stick to um
A :  You think it's possible ?
C :  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  No , I mean
C :  Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that
B :  It's not really the we we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . But uh I think a user need
C :  Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , but
D :  No , but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , or
B :  Don't have a the the
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah if we can send email from it .
C :  But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ .
D :  No . No .
B :  Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if
D :  Cause for example yeah .
C :  Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . That's the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but uh we want so
D :  Yeah , you wou you would
D :  True .
A :  Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , uh
B :  And for all the person of the family maybe , so , yeah .
C :  Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?
A :  You don't need to tune it .
A :  Yeah , why not ? If it's
D :  I mean , for example the goo y you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller .
B :  Because you have new
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google .
D :  Google is is simple , works fine , so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .
D :  Uh thi this
D :  I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .
C :  The then nn no . Tha
A :  Not too expensive too .
C :  But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . That's the same yeah .
D :  See
D :  That's the problem , yeah . I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Ye
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . So let's go to the Industrial Designer . Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so .
D :  I mean , that's the point .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Two ?
B :  Yeah , participant two um
A :  Working ?
B :  Yeah , working design , so .
B :  I think
A :  I can
B :  Can you go to the next one ? I uh it's not this one . It's uh oth the oth so I It's the working design . Sorry .
A :  Okay .
B :  Component design . So this yeah so this is the described use What ?
A :  It's okay
B :  Are you inst
A :  Uh I think there's something wrong with your
C :  It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it .
A :  Maybe you you record it somewhere else .
B :  I don't think so .
C :  Participant one .
C :  Participant one .
A :  Interface concept .
A :  No .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Mm mm .
B :  Oh .
B :  Maybe I record recorded directly on the
B :  Computer .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh .
D :  Dunno .
A :  Nope . It seems that we have a problem with the
B :  Okay , okay . Yes .
D :  I dunno if you remember what you had to say or
B :  I can say it to you without .
A :  Yeah , so
C :  Yeah , maybe we can first come to
A :  No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh
C :  uh to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , then present it later .
D :  I think it's more interesting what he says , okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , exac
A :  You will had s some more information in I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , true .
B :  Yeah . In fact , I don't know , I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r
C :  Okay .
A :  So .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , never mind .
C :  Okay .
B :  of the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside and so .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . And
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , no ?
B :  Yeah , yeah mm .
B :  Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , so hmm .
A :  So .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  And what tha what about the uh
A :  materials ?
B :  And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , or you know , you can have some
A :  Impersonal , mm-hmm .
D :  Special for
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood and it can be interesting .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .
B :  And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap
B :  integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .
A :  Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
A :  And you think that we will be
B :  Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , so .
A :  Okay .
A :  So wood . And what about the buttons ?
B :  I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .
A :  No it's fashion , yeah .
D :  What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess .
B :  I think a touch screen
B :  will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so . But And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So you got email ?
A :  I dunno . I think we have only uh five minutes left . Participant four ? Functional requirements ?
D :  Okay .
D :  Uh no , trend watching .
D :  The other one .
A :  This one ?
D :  Yeah . Uh , I think so , just
D :  Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um
D :  have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
D :  So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and I mean i i it sounds good technically but it's it's not what they want and uh
C :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
D :  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .
A :  Okay .
D :  At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use .
D :  So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . Now i if we look at fashion in general um
D :  Okay .
D :  Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .
B :  Ah yes .
B :  Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah .
D :  'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .
D :  And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris
B :  Okay .
B :  And fruit and vegetables yeah .
D :  we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .
B :  Spongy 'Kay .
B :  Okay , yeah , yeah .
D :  I dunno .
B :  Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?
D :  Yeah thi this is this would be like um
D :  plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh
B :  Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah .
D :  device , so um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend
D :  in fashion .
B :  Okay .
A :  So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , maybe will attract
B :  Yeah .
B :  Solar .
D :  Yeah , so when I think it's
B :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  It will be a
A :  pro-ecology consumers . Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I think
B :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
A :  Case .
C :  Later ?
A :  So you think case .
A :  Something spongy . Someth no wood .
B :  No wood but Plastic ?
D :  Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know .
B :  Would some
A :  Maybe you
B :  I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . It depends on the design we want , so .
D :  Yeah , maybe the base .
D :  But still y
A :  It's it's natural .
B :  Yeah , it's natural and i
D :  Yeah .
A :  Th The feeling is natural , so maybe we can stay with wood .
B :  And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol
D :  Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view .
B :  Mm , yeah , it's not right , so .
A :  But it's still fashion .
D :  But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or I dunno .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , something that you can into it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh and what about the user interface concept ?
B :  Google and
A :  Google and fancy ?
B :  and fancy , f how about the the voice ? And
A :  Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some
A :  disadvantages with this .
C :  Uh yes .
B :  Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how
B :  It It is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . The smart controller .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah . But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , so .
A :  Yeah , but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .
B :  But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so .
A :  That's true .
D :  Yeah d
C :  Okay .
D :  I dunno .
A :  So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  It's good .
A :  And L_C_D_ buttons .
B :  Yeah , L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
B :  And pf what can we think a supplement to
D :  What interface ?
A :  Yeah , for the interface something added value .
B :  I think the supplement can be the voice . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but
B :  it can be a part of
A :  With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use
B :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .
B :  Yeah . Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . Yeah , turning yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands , so .
A :  Turning the T_V_ o on o or off .
A :  So , adding some vocal commands .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Simple ones ?
B :  Yeah , simple ones for
A :  Okay .
A :  So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in
A :  in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
B :  expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new
B :  Yeah .
A :  And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .
D :  Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , fruits .
A :  Yeah .
D :  If possible .
B :  Okay .
A :  And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , so you will have to model model something .
B :  Need it to be , okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay . Yep
A :  And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  So , no more questions , we can close the session .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Sounds good , mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Okay , cool .
C :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm . So , ready ?
D :  No not really . Just
C :  'Kay .
D :  Crap .
B :  Sorry , I I um I'm afraid
D :  Okay .
C :  It's perfect .
A :  Your judgement it's is biased .
B :  Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype .
D :  'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ?
A :  So , we are So
C :  Where ? It's here .
B :  Okay .
A :  let's go for our detailed design meeting .
D :  Yep .
A :  So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , and our Industrial Designer , Baba .
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control , and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost .
C :  'Kay .
B : 
A :  And in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . So maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their You have s oh , sorry . Oops .
C :  I have slides .
B :  Okay .
C :  Ah , that is three .
B :  Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything .
C :  Product prod
D :  What slides ?
C :  Yep .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  So , this is our product or prototype .
C :  This is made by clay .
A :  Looks strange .
C :  Yeah . Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour , uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . It's we call it a mushroom design . It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . So this is a introduction of our product . Next a mo
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh
A :  Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but keep on speaking .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . Um , and uh
A :  Oh . Maybe , I hope so .
B :  Yeah , yeah I'm sure .
B :  Yeah , that's true .
C :  the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . So it's quite convenient for user to use it .
A :  Yeah , okay , but don't touch don't destroy your prototype .
C :  Yeah , s okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so
C :  uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel
C :  and there's some cute button . You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so
A :  Everything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , everything's mushroom . Mush
B :  Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know , centre is yellow and t d
C :  Mushroom design , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it .
B :  To integrate , you know yeah .
B :  I don't think I hope nobody will eat it . You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the the in
C :  Yeah .
A :  Oh .
D :  Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits yeah . Yeah .
B :  Really ? But
A :  Fruits and vegetables .
B :  Fruit and vegetable , so mushroom was a kind of you know uh
A :  Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I don't think it is .
A :  It's vegetable .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mushroom ? Oh , uh I'm not sure . We can it's a veg a kind of vegetable , but you know we we integrated them with different colour .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So th it's something eatable .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know .
D :  No , I mean , yeah yeah . Inspira inspiration is
B :  And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material , so .
D :  True .
B :  And so
C :  Yeah .
A :  Next slide .
C :  Uh , no this our only two slides .
B :  So what we w what I can add is that , you know he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , it is a low level chip , and
C :  Yeah .
C :  So we cut it to see .
B :  You know , we don't need to k . You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay . So where's the battery battery ?
B :  The battery it is under . It is in th in in the base , yeah .
A :  In the base . In the basement . In the basement . And where is the solar solar cell ?
C :  Base . Here ?
D :  But we say uh we sa we said solar .
A :  Where is the solar cell ?
B :  In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and I don't think so , but it it's might be okay , so . I it might be okay . So
A :  Oh . Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price ?
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , we'll see after . We will have first to so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ?
C :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I mean , we gonna try to measure how
D :  good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design , and first one was uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  look and feel .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think . Uh just let me check .
B :  So , four point three point five , it means it's acceptable .
D :  One one being true , and seven being false . Okay . Ouch .
B :  Oops .
C :  Okay .
D :  Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ?
C :  Yeah , I think so .
B :  I think you have nice colours . I don't The sha the bowl shape people like .
D :  But is it
C :  Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour
D :  Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really
B :  Is it really fancy ?
C :  So it depend on how d do you define fancy .
D :  Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look .
B :  But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that
B :  Do Don't do that , please .
D :  I dunno where the lemon is , but I mean it's not obvious .
B :  I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so
A :  It would be bet more like a lemon ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  If
B :  Because i
D :  I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or
A :  Yeah .
B :  Less button .
C :  so , my mush .
A :  Looks like more fruit . Maybe a pineapple ?
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , but you don't have any button now .
D :  Yeah . I dunno .
A :  And you know , you have the
A :  finger here , with the buttons ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
B :  That's uh yeah , is that that's a good idea . So that's great . That's great .
D :  Yeah , it's getting
A :  It looks more like a pineapple . Sorry . What's the use for that ?
C :  Uh , for turn turn the ball . If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel .
B :  I have no idea , so .
B :  I have no idea what
A :  And where is the voice recognition ?
D :  Okay .
C :  Uh .
C :  Ah , it's embedded , your microphone . Th this th th there's two two functions . This is microphone array
D :  Yeah , that's
A :  Okay .
D :  Wait th that's the second point . First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .
B :  If it is fancy or not .
A :  Okay . Is it better like that ? Looks okay , let's say it's a pineapple now .
D :  I mean
B :  So we can we can say t
B :  The colour , is the colour acceptable ?
D :  No , the colour is okay , that's fine . I mean it's but I would say there is more too much red .
B :  So the shape now .
A :  It looks like a now you took it .
B :  It's too much red ? In the basement ?
D :  Um if
A :  It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . Mm uh
C :  Okay .
D :  Right . So , from one to seven ?
B :  I will give I will
A :  Seven is the ma the maximum ?
B :  I'll gi
D :  No , seven is false and one is true .
B :  I'll give two or three . Three , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me .
A :  Three , I will say three .
D :  Three ?
D :  Okay .
C :  'Kay .
D :  Three .
A :  Isn't it bitter like that ?
C :  Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Then uh let me
B :  What other
D :  The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .
B :  Is it easy to use ?
A :  Feasible ?
B :  Ye uh
A :  You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an
B :  Embedded .
C :  Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . There four microphone . So they they they they there's a microphone array .
B :  It's a micro array , okay .
A :  Oh . Okay , and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?
C :  Yeah , yeah . So you can capture voice yeah , you c
B :  Oh yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah .
B :  And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is
D :  Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single .
B :  W Yeah , but
A :  We have tactile buttons .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I see , you have microphone array embedded . You have That's good . And you have , you know this ki this solar receptor that , you know Yes . Yeah .
D :  No , that's good . Yeah .
A :  Oh , yeah .
D :  Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe okay .
B :  I think technically it's acceptable , so
A :  Maybe two ?
D :  So using the same scale , two ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Two ? I would say two . You agree ?
B :  Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so .
D :  Okay . Now maybe the most critical one .
C :  Yeah , I agree .
A :  It's better like that , isn't it ?
C : 
B :  Most
A :  Okay .
D :  L last one w I would like to judge is
D :  is it easy to use ?
B :  Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking . You just need the command .
C :  Yeah , it's very easy .
D :  Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the
C :  You can use this in this way .
B :  As a principle .
D :  Please .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Th this is the base . So you can turn to change the channel .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?
C :  You just tu turn d d
B :  I think maybe if you he
D :  Like if you want to go from
A :  Oh , ok I understand . You take take the remote , so and you can turn like that to change the channel ? I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast .
B :  If you hear some click
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but imagine you y
B :  Yeah , it would
D :  Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?
B :  Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult .
C :  Yeah .
D :  How can you go directly to twenty , for example ?
C :  No , no , no . I if y uh if it depend on the the angle you turn the
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . I agree . I agree . But I mean if you're fro from two ?
B :  Yeah but y how you need to know I
C :  I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . So change . Yeah .
B :  I think something that Yeah .
A :  Yeah , you have a , like that , and so on .
B :  And you you can
D :  Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh
A :  Oh yeah .
C :  Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree . So you got how many degree you you it
D :  We're not talking
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go
B :  I think you can if you have a scale , so
C :  No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the
C :  the turn ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you
D :  Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?
C :  It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the
D :  So you you count one degree , two degrees , no .
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it .
D :  I don't think so .
B :  Yeah , it's a bit difficult .
C :  I think so I think so you can do it . I think so , you can just change .
B :  I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so
D :  Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main
C :  There's uh also a number , you know .
A :  Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ?
B :  Uh , yeah , and y that's yeah .
D :  And this would be more for browsing , ah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  To see uh yeah uh
C :  Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Seems to be good .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Good choice , mister David Jordan .
B : 
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I mean you're famous . You .
B :  And but I'd
C :  And also you can , if you i
A :  yeah , what's what's this cherry ?
C :  You ca you can turn this . Or you ca you can you can also turn this . For this you can tune it's for tune . You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . It's like fine , from coarse to fine . This is coarse , this is fine .
B :  It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe .
B : 
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , yeah yeah . That's
A :  Okay .
C :  So it's coarse to fine design .
B :  that's very technologic , so . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah .
C :  Yeah is is this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . This is from one channel to
B :  S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates maybe one of the
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , th you have the vocal commands .
B :  Uh it's k on off , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  On off .
D :  Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas
A :  Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control .
B :  Yeah , sleeping .
D :  Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah .
A :  That's true . W that why we have the solar ti yeah . So three .
D :  Solar .
B :  To compensate . Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  So , which number ?
B :  Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three .
A :  Do you agree ? Three ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , agree , agree .
D :  So reasonably , is four , is one ?
B :  Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean .
D :  So , three .
A :  And what's your opinion ?
D :  Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . I'd like I mean this is the just a prototype . I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use , but I don't know .
B :  Will you give
B :  four ?
B :  Five ?
B :  Yeah , so maybe if
C :  Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have you just turn the turn the ball . There's two kind of balls , the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . But in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but y you know
D :  So you have yeah .
D :  Uh by pushing zero after after the first one .
B :  You just push two button , zero and and one . And that's
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Are there some buttons ? Okay .
C :  Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one .
A :  It's not what you said previously . Previously you said that turning this was the fine
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , if you're changing your mind .
D :  Fine to coarse .
A :  Fine to coarse . And from ten to ten channels here .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this .
A :  Okay .
C :  Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc
D :  Okay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ? This has to stay on the table .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  In fact on a flat place
C :  I i this is just a base . You can just
B :  You can
D :  Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it
C :  Yeah .
A :  Oh
B :  Oh ye yes , that's right .
A :  Yeah , no no , no . You can't put it out . It's just your turning from the base . You need to have everything in hand . If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . It's impossible . You need to put it on and turn .
D :  Just
D :  It's
B :  Oh my God .
D :  Yeah .
D :  You know tha that's the weak point , because with a traditional one you just have one hand .
C :  You use your y
A :  Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . Nobody would take it . So nobody w will lost lose it .
B : 
C :  So th this is a d next generation controller . Yeah .
D :  Sure . Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  yeah maybe , maybe may it's the next prototype , maybe we cou
C :  Okay okay , okay .
A :  S maybe we can change from th
B :  Four . Maybe four , it's okay . I'll put four .
C :  Four . Okay .
A :  Four ? Easy to use , four . Gonna say four .
D :  Four . Uh it's even easier to maybe .
B :  Yeah , four it's more reasonable .
B :  You can you can erase with this er yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so .
D :  So , average ?
B :  So it's nine , nine over three . Oh yeah , it's .
D :  Three ?
C :  Three ?
A :  Trois . Three .
C :  Trois .
D :  Okay , so
B :  It need maybe some wo further work , but it's
D :  Yeah , especially on the easy to use
B :  Yeah , uh s yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  target .
B :  Might it might be fine .
A :  So , th the project is accepted ?
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , b I think
A :  But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  So uh mm mm . Mm .
B :  That's the finance .
A :  Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the
A :  evaluation . So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
A :  So we need to calculate the production cost . As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . So , just have a look at the okay here is the
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  sheet , so so it has the energy source . We have hand dynamo . No , we don't use that . We have battery , right ? Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , but we have solar cells . Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or such as
D :  No .
B :  Yeah , we have battery .
B :  No , um solar cells , yeah .
B :  Uh I think in each ball you have three three uh yeah , three , yeah . Three three solar cells .
A :  as number of branches ? Three ? So , electronic .
A :  Single simple chip on print ? Just one would be necessary ? One ?
B :  S s simple , simple , yeah . Yeah .
A :  Zero for the others .
A :  And sample sensor , sample speaker .
B :  Mm . One maybe , yeah .
A :  One ?
A :  As we have voice recognition , I think .
B :  Yeah yeah yeah .
B :  Is it
A :  So the case .
D : 
B :  Is sh it
D :  So we are all already nineteen .
B :  Wooden .
A :  Okay , just keep on going , just to have an idea .
C :  The solar cell is too expensive .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think .
A :  Well uh yeah , but what what about case ? Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . I think it's more like double curved .
D :  That's gonna be double curved , yeah .
B :  Double curve , yeah , double curve .
A :  One ?
B :  One , you have .
A :  Uh wood ?
B :  But it's yeah , a a rubber uh
D :  Rather four buttons . Oh no , interface .
A :  Uh do we need special colour ? Y maybe , two ? We have two special colours . Push button .
B :  Yeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure .
C :  Mm . Yeah , we have four .
C :  Five .
B :  Five ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Scroll wheel . We don no .
C :  No .
A :  It it's more like integrated scor .
B :  I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . Y you tu you turn you turn it , so
C :  No no .
D :  Yeah tha that's wheel .
C :  No no no , it
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , true . Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay , yeah , yeah . Scr
A :  So , no button supplements ?
D :  I think the price is okay .
C :  No .
D :  Um , no .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay we I think we have problem .
B :  L_C_ display , maybe . Interface .
A :  I think we s if we keep on adding things so we have to
B :  It's okay . fine .
D :  Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells .
A :  Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Has it changed .
B :  Yeah , it was stage one , so .
D :  No y i it did change , but just imagine we have
A :  Okay .
C :  We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh .
B :  So
C :  We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but we have you the the voice recognition , no ?
D :  Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really
C :  Yeah it's the one it's m maybe we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version . Advanced version we have speak .
A :  Okay .
B :  I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . Because uh it seems that this can be yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , if
A :  Or it would be better .
C :  Plastic is free .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So , do we need special colour ?
D :  Yeah , that's one of the requirement .
A :  Because we have red .
B :  Yeah , red and yellow . Fancy .
C :  Wait .
A :  Red and yellow .
D :  We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . Black then is a regular colour , so .
C :  We we can we can we c yellow .
A :  I think so we need if we try to have a kind of
D :  Yeah , one .
A :  pineapple bee .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So push button then it's it's the next expensive one .
A :  Yeah . An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . Integrated scroll wheel push button . So we'll we have only one ?
D :  Yeah , thi this might be .
A :  And push button . So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh
D :  Close to .
B :  One .
B :  I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have yeah .
D :  Okay , so what's the bottleneck ?
C :  How about we change the sale ?
D :  Double curved .
B :  Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . F some
A :  Something flat .
D :  Yeah , but flat
A :  S uncurved . Yeah , maybe not .
B :  Single curve . Single curve should be fine , so .
D :  Case , what's the ca
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh , what
A :  Mm . Nearly .
D :  And then one Euro left .
C :  Ah we have one
D :  Um .
A :  Maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . I think there's a problem with the push push button . We only need maybe just one . Just one . Yeah . So yeah , you will have So one button , and s
B :  It's it's a bad idea , so .
D :  Um
B :  Two ? One . That's fine . That's fine . One s one scroll wheel , so And the vocal chord , it's fine . It I th it's fine .
C :  Okay . Okay . Agree .
D :  So we have one button ,
D :  one wheel .
A :  scroll wheel with push button on it .
A :  So
D :  It's good they're not charging anything for that .
A :  So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is
C :  Cou could we have look
A :  twelve fifty e
C :  Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ?
D :  Yeah y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half .
A :  Yeah , but it's under or equal . It's not written . Sometimes it's under or equal .
B :  It's fine .
B :  It's under or equal . It's fine , so
D :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Okay . So let's say
A :  Twelve fifty .
C :  Wha what yeah .
B :  It's fine , twelve fifty uh
C :  Which part is the most expensive part ?
D :  Solar cells .
B :  The solar cells , r is i is it ?
A :  Yeah , I think .
C :  Yeah , I think it's not t t
A :  I think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be
B :  Yeah , to be able to si to sell it .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Cheaper .
D :  That's nice argument , but if it's it's still four our of twelve .
B :  Yeah , with mi
B :  It's it is really really uh really very very expensive , though .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Maybe if uh okay .
A :  Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah but we just have one button .
D :  Easy . I don't know about powerful . Yeah .
B :  It's easy to use . It's very easy to use .
A :  Easy , powerful .
D :  Mm .
A :  So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product .
D :  Uh that's what we've just done .
B :  No .
B :  We've done it with it is under the if it was low , high or so .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So
D :  okay .
A :  Now
B :  So
B :  So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ?
D :  Well I think we have just have to discuss if
A :  So
B :  Okay , okay , it's fine .
D :  I dunno .
A :  So did you enjoy your clay modelling ?
C :  Yes . Of course . This is my job .
A :  Yeah ? Was it a nice way to create your remote control ?
C :  Yeah , it's uh
C :  it's good , to
C :  to create a control instead of a computer .
B :  Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end .
B :  And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And for the marketing guy ?
D :  Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff
B :  Yep .
D :  next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay , okay .
A :  And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh
A :  and yellow .
B :  Yellow . I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . It can be an interesting I don't know
A :  Yes , just lemon .
B :  Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon .
C :  Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um
B :  It's flat , uh
C :  Yeah yeah it's flat , yeah the shape is very boring . Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_ ? So you can you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can
A :  Squared ?
B :  Yeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control .
B :  Yeah , that's that would be really interesting , actually .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Because the T_V_ you also
A :  Oh , that's interesting . You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device .
B :  Device devi
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . Maybe two years it's dead .
C :  Yeah .
B :  The fruit ? Yeah .
A :  Maybe
A :  Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects .
B :  Yeah , it's
D :  Yeah .
B :  But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product .
B :  Yeah .
D :  T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so .
D :  If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for
B :  Yeah , yeah . That's a yeah , yeah .
B :  We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know .
D :  fifteen years
A :  Customable T_V_ .
B :  Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep
D :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Ah such yeah . You've already said mobile phones . Yeah , and following
D :  Tha that would that would make it . Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , you can keep the global appearan
B :  The mood of persons , the fashions uh
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  We int
A :  It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr
B :  Yeah , T_V_ , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's
C :  Yeah .
B :  So what i and do w is it Okay .
A :  So I think the costs are within the budget . We're just at twelve fifty Euros . So do you think you can celebrate your creation ?
B :  Yeah , the pr at
C :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
C :  And you can celebrate your leadership .
A :  Oh , thanks a lot . Thank you , mister David Jordan .
B :  Yeah but I think f it's really a celebrating object . So it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy , so . Uh it's it's a pr it's like yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah . It's party party remote control .
A :  The thing now is to to sell it .
C :  Yeah , it's your job . Sell it . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , right , go and sell it . Goo and good luck , so
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve
D :  Uh-huh . Twenty five Euros . Yeah , I think it's
C :  Twenty five Euros , yeah . Twenty five Euros . No , it's not so expensive .
B :  It should be fine .
A :  It's maybe a little bit expensive .
D :  It's cheap , yeah .
D :  No , I
D :  I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know .
B :  Wh really ? It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . S
C :  Okay .
A :  Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come , it's really fruit .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  I I think I like the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so
A :  But don't put sugar in it , it's not working .
D :  No , the colours are uh it's perfect , yeah .
B :  It's perfect , and
D :  True . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still .
B :  I p is th y the the yellow ball thing that
A :  Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more is most important , because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control .
D :  Uh
D :  Still that was one of the requirements we had . It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere .
B :  Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_
A :  Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ .
D :  Mm .
B :  Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , so we have the slogan too .
C :  So we have to give a
C :  So we have give him give it a cute name .
D :  Cute na
A :  Yeah th no , it's the it's the pineapple control remote control . It's a pineapple now , it has changed . It's a pineapple . Pineapple .
C :  Mush mushroom controller .
D :  You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . It's not the trend .
B :  It's not a mushroom . It's a pineapple remote controls .
C :  Pine apple .
B :  Yeah , pineapple remote remote control .
D :  Yeah , but just flying saucer , or
A :  With cherry on top .
B :  Oh , that
C :  Okay .
D :  I would say flying saucer .
B :  Oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so
D :  It's more appropriate , somehow .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  That's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine .
D :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
A :  Will you buy one ?
B :  Yeah . Yeah I will try I'll try . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage
A :  Try to . Okay uh
C :  Twenty five Euro .
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ so so you need to buy one .
B :  Yeah I always lose my Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be
C :  Okay .
A :  One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket .
D :  Mm .
C :  Traditional one ? Yeah .
C :  So this one and this one . What do you choose ? What do you choose ?
A :  I prefer the laser remote control . No .
B :  I think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's
C :  Okay .
B :  it's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Oh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside .
B :  Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea .
D :  Yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . We had some problems going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno .
A :  Yeah .
B :  .
A :  I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah .
D :  Yeah , afterwards , if
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  if it's a new trend .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah that's that fine . So we can celebrate now . That's our new product .
A :  So
A :  Champagne , mister Baba .
D :  We should celebrate .
B :  Yes . It's it's fine . It's
B :  I like it .
B :  Next time . Well , I'll buy one here .
C :  So buy one .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So
D :  Mm .
A :  Okay , I will close this . Mm .
B :  Yeah . No ?
A :  So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  and we have a nearly final product .
D :  Our final prototype which yeah .
B :  Final prototype , yeah , ye yeah .
A :  Final prototype , right . So , thank you very much . Very productive .
C :  Prototype , yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay . Thanks .
B :  S so who is going to take the remote control ?
