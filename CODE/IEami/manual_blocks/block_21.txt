A :  Right w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control . Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody , uh one that everybody wants , uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company .
A :  Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital to this project um I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , um m Kendra with the uh um designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . Um .
D :  Mm .
A :  What's uh the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want , uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh
A :  everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for a while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh uh everybody's experience is please do so . Uh
A :  in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make . So we'll start with Andrew .
D :  Oh my name's Andrew I'm a I'm the Market Research
D :  person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view .
A :  Right Kendra .
C :  I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I'll be
C :  working on the design .
A :  Right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so .
C :  Right . Yep , I'm just open to being creative .
B :  Uh I'm Katie , I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh yeah .
A :  Yep , good .
A :  Okay , very very quickly , um this I don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank . Everybody says what they what they want to say , uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different , uh I want one , um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it
A :  uh scenario . User-friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think oh yes that's it's obvious how that works , uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that I may not need another remote control but uh it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one . And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants .
A :  The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production .
A :  Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um
A :  In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um
A :  So I I everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal .
D :  Um , badger . Uh it's it's got nice contrast with black and white and uh I feel they're underdog kind of status and they're , the
A :  Mm and why ?
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Oh right uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the the white streaks in it . Kendra .
C :  Um probably a duck I just I li I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Right , okay .
B :  Uh 's horses , no particular reason why .
A :  Uh-huh , fair enough yeah . I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , I think homo sapien because of their their uh overall ability to uh uh
D :  Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes to make T_V_ remotes .
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Indeed absolutely yes , tha that's um
A :  Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um , we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product , we're looking at making it at a very good price . Um , okay , um would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls .
C :  Well I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well . Um , but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons and so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , you know .
A :  No .
A :  Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ?
A :  Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? Are there you know , bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again ?
B :  Um
B :  I think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't
B :  Mm .
D :  like an area that's put a lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain . Like it's very a very like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like
B :  Mm .
D :  Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition .
A :  Um what so wh what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about ?
D :  Um .
D :  Something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control . So if you want , something that looks like uh something that makes you think oh what's this ? Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen , but it makes you think oh . So , sorry that's a bit vague .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  . Yeah d no I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , people won't see it as a remote control um and uh
D :  Uh I suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to
D :  to make make people aware of the product .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls ?
C :  I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto , so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and s you know some quite fancy ones um than the some from personal experience which look nice but aren't particularly comfortable . Um any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Well from the mouse idea you could , remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button .
A :  Yes , I mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh
B :  Mm .
D :  I suppose .
D :  Easily , yeah yeah .
A :  fi find the button buttons easily .
C :  But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them
D :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
C :  better .
A :  Yeah , that's uh must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's uh certainly be different . Um do we need it to uh I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all . Do we do we want uh
C :  Oh yeah .
B :  Mm that would be good .
C :  Like a like a mobile phone ? Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm , yeah that would be good .
B :  Mm .
A :  Okay . So , Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire
A :  um the planet with ?
D :  Mm-hmm , um especially if we try to sell , what two million of them .
D :  Oh sorry , four million of 'em , but uh
D :  I think if w if we market it as as not as not well this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable and like you just it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice , therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time . I think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room uh but also a device that uh
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  is practically sound . So um , I dunno we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , yeah , yeah , well I d I think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of . Um okay well first thoughts on um
D :  If you .
D :  Mm .
A :  the the industrial design side .
B :  Oh I think it's it's remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much , but you don't i i it's you sort of just assume they're always gonna work , you don't think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you're kinda like oh well fair enough there's all these complex things going on , it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually . They they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's
B :  God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective , very always dependable . Uh I don't think we should make it too small I 'cause I think it needs to it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah .
A :  Indeed .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But so yes dependable , and have a good medium range size .
A :  Okay , and um colours , materials ?
A :  Kendra , anyone ?
C :  Well , most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , so maybe we should go with something different or be able to I was just thinking of um what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um what are they called ? Like the face-plates that you change so we could have maybe I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things . Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , probably just plastic because that's always the lightest .
A :  .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm , mm-hmm .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Right .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay that's uh
A :  Again I don't think that's ever been done before , it's uh the sort of the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that I haven't got and uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  might need so . Uh Andrew , any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ?
D :  Um , well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several
D :  uh like
D :  you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but uh maybe thinking of that , it's considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it . Unless you were trying to
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think
B :  Well you could come up with like novelty ones , like they've done with the the mobile phones , you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like oh I want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Oh it's that's a that's a good idea .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-mm . Right , okay I think we've got um a good idea now . We uh meeting is uh
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah true .
A :  Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . So uh um we've got thirty minutes to
A :  start looking at the um at the design in more detail . Um
A :  then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh
A :  uh more formalised . Uh thank you very much indeed .
D :  .
C :  Okay .
B :  Thank you .
A :  Okay , welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group .
A :  I'll briefly go through the uh
A :  notes of the of the last meeting
A :  uh just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally , so uh . Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour .
C :  Sorry .
A :  Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items , that switching was easy ,
A :  that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular , um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . Um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls . Um and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you uh um
A :  mm uh use it . And that it shouldn't be too small , mm that it it gets lost .
A :  Um .
A :  Now uh
A :  uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations . Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . Um the uh
A :  the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought . Um and and then we'll as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out , and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and I uh
A :  Anyway . Okay .
A :  Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . Um and and they want it only to cover televisions .
A :  Um now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes , which uh I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only .
A :  Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background .
A :  Um now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that . Um it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway . Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which um
A :  mm uh is is is their choice , but uh um we we need to talk that through . Um okay , so uh
A :  after the meeting it'll be summarised and uh
A :  um notes sent out and uh etcetera . Okay , so we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody . Um again I there is no order of precedence here um so I I I'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first ?
D :  Uh I don't mind .
A :  P fine .
D :  Uh can I steal the cable ?
A :  Oh sorry , you can indeed .
D :  Cheers .
D :  I got a how do I start there ?
A :  Oh , if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that . That one .
D :  That one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see .
D :  Um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly .
D :  So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it .
D :  Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh
D :  more cost effective
D :  and we can put the price up .
D :  Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um
D :  they don't uh they , yeah , they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour .
D :  Uh again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and
D :  manually change channels or volume .
D :  And uh
D :  yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno .
D :  Uh um yeah and
D :  uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control .
A :  Mm .
D :  Maybe like it'll beep or something .
D :  And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is
D :  Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new like first time users and stuff .
D :  And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . Maybe don't even have to hold it as such .
A :  Mm .
A :  Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say .
D :  But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would .
A : 
D :  And uh there was another section on our on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , so . May be incrementally emitting , but yeah .
A :  Mm . Right .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , I must say that um the uh I c can't remember what um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh
A :  a thought and it it cuts out uh
D :  And uh it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you
A :  I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , j just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry .
D :  Yeah , um oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation .
D :  Um .
D :  You see this okay ? Almost no ? It's sorry it's a bit . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um
D :  like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ? Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance is used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , which are low relevance and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm . I mean
C :  It could be oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? Have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Hmm , hmm .
D :  Yeah , like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath .
B :  Mm .
A :  Uh .
A :  Should we actually bite the bullet here ? If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether . We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um
B :  Mm .
D :  Just remove them completely ?
C :  That might be the
A :  I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the
A :  Um now the the age structure we were looking at um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they
D :  Uh yeah .
A :  Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . Yes we
D :  Um no this is for pay more for speech recognition .
A :  That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at um well again , we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups .
D :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  If we wanted something
A :  different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it .
B :  Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . It might
A :  But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_
D :  Or even I mean you could even just have it left on . You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to
C :  Maybe i
C :  Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , you won't lose it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  It c well it I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it
B :  Mm .
C :  No .
D :  B_B_C_ one .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  just to activate it . Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different .
D :  Oh yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there ,
D :  Mm-mm .
A :  would people miss them ?
B :  But look at the importance of them . The volume settings .
D :  Relevance of two out of ten , yeah .
A :  Vol volume , yes um th w we need to s identify things that people actually need and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that
B :  Yeah .
B :  They're not used often but they are quite important when they're used . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  uh would appear to be essential .
D :  Stand out .
A :  Um .
A :  So we if we can design something that that looks interesting ,
A :  know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey , um
A :  and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option .
D :  Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . Uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation
A :  Do , please .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  word .
D :  'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote , you address the computer , and then give it a command .
A :  You cer certainly could .
B :  Mm .
A :  Depe uh i depends whether um if we want to make this
A :  so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say
D :  Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see .
A :  B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could
A :  print actually print it on the uh
D :  Mm-hmm , yeah .
A :  device itself .
A :  Um .
D :  I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote .
A :  S th this I th that's always gonna be a problem I think . Um and I I I s so I suppose one um
D :  Mm .
A :  could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with
D :  Oh no I I interrupted you , sorry .
A :  or no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there .
D :  Oh okay .
D :  Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better ,
A :  Mm okay .
D :  combined with uh decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um 'cause we're
D :  Oh , we could , yeah .
D :  We c yeah , we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so .
A :  Certainly could . Yeah , yeah .
D :  So uh yeah , if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really
B :  Mm .
A :  The I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper .
D :  Yeah and probably it would look better as well .
A :  No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive .
D :  Yeah . yeah .
A :  Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box .
B :  Mm .
D :  Lined with numbered buttons and
A :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Okay , who sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? Yep , yep .
D :  Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything .
A :  Um given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh .
C :  Okay well , I can do mine .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Do you want the cable ?
C :  Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um .
B :  Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something .
C :  Oh .
D :  F_ eight .
B :  F_ eight .
C :  Is it doing
B :  Dunno .
D :  Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so .
C :  Okay .
A :  Ah , there we go .
B :  Oh yeah , it's going .
C :  Oh okay .
C :  Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be .
A :  Alright .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So these are the two different ones . This one um this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , then that would be easier .
A :  Mm , yeah .
C :  Um and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that .
C :  So that's my presentation .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , can I um I'm actually gonna use the um it's gonna cause great technical problems over here . I'm actually gonna use the
C :  F they probably clip to you .
B :  Oh yeah , they might be movable . Oh yeah , they're all they're not connected to anything on the table , you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yes , rather than the uh the the traditional in fact , um I won't even go that far . Um something like this shape , you know , sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape , um that you you sort of hold in your hand , um , well I'm trying to think
A :  uh uh uh l uh l such as I mean um something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , but with the the entire top with the , you know , the uh the infrared or whatever source .
B :  Mm .
A :  Uh so that you know , it's
A :  flying off in all directions , so that uh um uh again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of um
B :  Mm .
A :  actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the uh such a source , um you know , compromise the our our need for uh you know , it it being
A :  um mm permanently
A :  uh you know , available . Uh whether whether different technology um I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time . Uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different , um you know , short range , not like the old uh radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours . Um
A :  but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . Um and nothing else .
A :  Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that , but again , except that um you know the risk of losing it . Um anyway okay um so Kate , wh what are your uh your thoughts on this ?
B :  Yes , mm .
C :  Oh .
B :  Which one does this plug into ?
C :  Hmm I think it's all there .
B :  That one .
B :  I can't did you could you see it on you screen when it
C :  Oh yeah . That's kind of strange .
B :  That's not cool . Oh well . Anyways . Um alright , yeah , so um I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh .
B :  Oh there we go .
B :  Okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works . Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever . Um and it does this uh by well , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do . Um and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . Um
B :  Oh shoot . Okay . Uh just general findings . Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , uh some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver .
B :  And um oops . Uh-huh .
B :  This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . Uh this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons . Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually what ? Sends signals to the the television . And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there .
D :  Hmm .
B :  And so my personal preferences I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . And that's pretty much it .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we um I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one . Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones . Um given
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's uh , you know never needs replacing . Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one some sort of typical usage . You know , the the the battery will last
A :  know , five , ten years .
A :  By which time I mean when all's said and done , the digital television
A :  will be taking over in that time scale . Um
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh
B :  Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? Oh , cool .
A :  Yeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give 'em a new one . Um it's , you know , it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a well , it's actually a marketing gimmick . I mean it's hardly a gimmick , it's uh it's totally practical . Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um
B :  Yeah , fair enough .
A :  uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it
D :  It could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time .
A :  Yeah . Are are people really gonna use it though ? Um .
B :  Mm , mm .
C :  Yeah , people are pro I would think that people might forget I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , so .
D :  I suppose , yeah .
B :  Mm yeah .
A :  I I th I think
B :  Mm-mm .
A :  Yeah , it's um I mean I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . Um .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies . And that's pretty much yeah . Yeah , when it turns itself off , that's when I plug it in , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  When it yeah , wh when it's died is a problem . Yeah , yeah , yeah , so uh um what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ?
B :  Yeah , think that's a good idea .
C :  No .
D :  Uh . That sounds pretty good , yeah .
A :  Is the uh you know , we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here . Um you know , cut cost within the
C :  Um .
B :  Mm .
A :  manufacturing and uh
A :  you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective .
C :  Do they make batteries that last that long ?
A :  I mean th th certainly . Um I can't think of anything off the s top of my head , but there are certainly things that you buy . I mean calculators for example .
B :  They usually have the little light uh source , I dunno what the heck they're called , the but yeah , the little cells that
C :  Yeah , they have that little solar
A :  Som well some do , I mean th th but there are battery ones that um are you know , sort of permanently sealed . In in fact I'd
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Most of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two , like when there is light , they'll work off the light , and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it .
A :  Yeah , uh uh
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , I I mean th th this needs going t into the technology a bit . I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  I would think is
A :  i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life .
B :  Oh , it depend if it's uh depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking , yeah . Yeah , then they're clicking a lot , yeah .
A :  Um .
C :  Yeah , some people are
A :  If , but I say if if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market n
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  W like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight
C :  Per hour ?
D :  times per hour .
A :  Right .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Wow . That's a lot .
A :  Oh , I must admit I hadn't um I'd I'd missed that . That does sound excessive .
D :  But then again , if you think it of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like
A :  Yeah .
D :  That's it's less than a second , um .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Well that's right , and and I I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , or whether it's just a
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  sorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for , I don't know I don't actually know . Um .
C :  Though I think with digital T_V_ , like I know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that , so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  channels that way instead of
A :  Mm .
A :  Right , so I've got a message to say five minutes , I dunno how long ago that appeared . Um 'cause we're we're getting um right , so I'd I need to sum up very quickly here um . We're looking at extreme simplicity .
C :  Uh-oh .
A :  We're looking at a
A :  radically different shape .
A :  Possibly no buttons at all um , but if you can incorporate um
A :  channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine . Um in the I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , because , you know , shape is no longer an
A :  a uh um a serious constraint . But we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , uh if clearly only need the main functions .
A :  Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off .
A :  Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable
A :  uh covers . Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep . Hmm .
A :  Right .
C :  Um
A :  So uh
C :  Oh I just have one question . So are we doing just the television or are we doing so not D_V_D_ players , we okay , okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  We are doing just the television . No .
A :  I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given , no ?
B :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , like in the email of television only . In fact they're in the constraints email that I got .
A :  Right .
D :  Didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ?
A :  Oh yeah well th that's one I s that's one I sent you , which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh what came down from from head office . Um
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Oh okay . Oh yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  That's that that that that's their uh their view .
A :  Okay , so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting , thank you very much indeed .
C :  Okay .
B :  Cool .
A :  Alright ? Alright . Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . Um the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . Um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn . Um and people lose them . And
A :  We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . That um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . Uh
A :  Okay .
A :  So again um , I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use uh um
A :  a a a long lasting one . And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . And uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life .
A :  Um now the the the internal chip um and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? Uh I mean I'm I'm I'm
A :  n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . But uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise . And then the uh , you know , the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendra's field and uh
A :  we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those
A :  uh da today . Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we p um
A :  go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . Uh
A :  and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh
A :  ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . Uh so , if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k .
B :  Okay . Um
A :  Kate .
A :  Oh I'm sorry , oh sorry .
B :  Um p there we go .
B :  'Kay , I'll just be talking about the components design . And
B :  Okay , basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ . Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um .
B :  Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and sort of seen by the T_V_ and which uh changes the channels .
B :  Um . Oh . Uh cool .
B :  Uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . Um
B :  however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost . That's something we should think about . Also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it .
B :  Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea .
B :  Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . Um , however that's gonna cost more , but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . And that pretty much sums it up .
A :  Okay , so how um sorry , can you uh just put that one back up again , please ? Um .
B :  Mm . Oh yep , sorry . Yep .
A :  Uh d d d okay , I mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . Do we do we know uh by how much ?
B :  Mm .
B :  Um I don't actually have any price information , no .
A :  And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip .
B :  Um it a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . Oh w yeah , we did the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form , uh so it would uh it's hard to predict the time .
A :  Right , okay .
A :  Right , I think we need to make a a decision here . Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology .
B :  Mm .
A :  Um uh now before we go round everybody else , does anybody um
C :  I
A :  h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ?
C :  I just have a question about that . Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites um and that w
B :  W just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit , but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working .
C :  Okay . Then it doesn't matter . Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  Cause uh I must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . So uh um I mean I d d for slightly different well no , I mean , it's if you you
C :  Yeah .
A :  speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so uh bu I mean the this this information is from is this is the internal company information , is it ?
B :  Uh bits of it , yeah .
C :  Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , you know , hundred and fifty pounds or something .
A :  So uh
B :  Yes , as well .
C :  As opposed to the twenty Euros , twenty five Euros .
A :  Yeah , mm true , again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh
A :  uh decide .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , that's that's right . It's like it's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is . But we don't know . Um .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I mean uh
A :  I su i I mean if given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before , um th th the double risk ,
A :  uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Um .
A :  Thoughts ?
C :  Well , another thought I oh , sorry , go ahead .
D :  Would
D :  Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh
D :  like um
D :  maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost .
A :  I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ?
B :  Uh it's fundament well I mean I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning , so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so I think you have to
A :  I mean I think we
C :  Oh yeah .
B :  Hm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing .
A :  Yeah , I I I I I think that's uh
B :  Mm .
C :  And we've been talking about it the whole time . Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it .
B :  Mm , mm .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm , right , okay .
B :  Mm .
D :  Uh yeah , it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative .
C :  Yeah .
D :  From uh my presentation show , so . Uh technologically innovative .
A :  Yeah , it should be
A :  Right , okay , so .
B :  No , that sounds good . Mm .
A :  Fine . Okay . I it will have voice recognition um uh if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons ?
B :  Mm . Cool .
C :  Okay .
B :  Um
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I I would say we do , yeah .
C :  I think so .
A :  Right .
A :  Okay . Sorry , d did you want to say anything ? No ? Okay . Shall we move rapidly on to uh Kendra ? Uh um ra rapidly move the cable over .
B :  Uh nope , that was it , that was it . Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  Let's see .
A :  Mm .
A :  Oh good .
C :  Oh .
C :  Yes .
C :  Is it gonna work ?
B :  Yeah , it's thinking about it .
A :  Mm yeah , it'll get there . Yep .
C :  Okay . Okay , so I did some research on the internet and um what you know , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , um commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just kind of a variety of choices . Um findings , so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . There're some special ones available , like this one right here , which is marketed towards children , um different designs , and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume because people some
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Alright .
C :  Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like . So just kind of minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm yeah .
A :  Sorry y y yeah , if I can interrupt you . Well d p 'kay , do you wanna say anything about um slide controls ? I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh
B :  Uh I think they're they're about the same cost really . I I mean , I think it's just sort of the the there's a lot of slide buttons out there . I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . Mm yeah .
A :  Okay , fair enough , fine .
C :  Just because I n for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down and then the this is my great little drawing .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Good , good .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So three three there's three buttons on a slider . Three buttons , channel up channel up down and
C :  Y yes , yes .
D :  Well , if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . Because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks , if you know what I mean , up like one unit , if you see what I mean . So it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like like like like a cog or something . So you kinda take it up one at a time .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay . Um
C :  The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh .
A :  This one on the one side and one yeah . Okay .
D :  Uh you could you could as l as like a mouse you could
B :  Ye yeah , 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different . You'd know what you were fiddling with .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , like the shape of it almost like a mouse , with a
A :  Yeah , or yeah uh th th the I mean thi this is what the we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do .
C :  That was
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so we we're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change
C :  Um well I was thinking kind of just for the volume , but what what do you guys think ? We could
A :  of one sort . Just for the volume , uh .
B :  Mm .
D :  I dunno if it depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , I dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , and then you could control the buttons with your fingers .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah , 'cause if yeah , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , just the way it would
A :  Fingers , yeah . I mean it's it's
A :  It yeah , I mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two . So okay . Right so uh that's sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo okay , fine .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm yeah , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah , yeah .
C :  I'm just gonna pass this along .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm right .
D :  Here we go . Uh yeah , this is my report on trend watching . The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions .
A :  Right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And uh
D :  the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy , look and feel
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  uh instead of the current functional look and feel . This is a st well I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect , which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it . So uh and the third being easy to use is probably a given , we have to try and incorporate , so uh
A :  Mm .
A :  Well I I mean I th I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those .
D :  Uh exactly , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  I s that out of sequence ? Uh yeah , sorry . Uh yeah , and uh from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . Uh sorry , clothes , shoes and furniture
C :  Oh .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  and uh
D :  a spongy material to be used on the on the outside .
A :  Mm I hadn't thought of that , that's different , certainly .
D :  Yeah . But uh I was gonna say um yeah , fruit and vegetables , uh important to this year um important to furniture , I'm just gonna say
B :  Mm .
A :  What ?
D :  uh f like it's in if if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . But fashions do don't last very long .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and
B :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Uh .
C :  Yeah like the kind you get on like hand weights . You know , that kind of spongy yeah .
B :  Mm , yeah , that weird I dunno what that is , but yeah .
A :  Uh .
D :  A kind of yeah . Oh
B :  Mm .
A :  Also means you can drop it without damaging it .
D :  Yeah . That's c cool .
B :  Uh , yeah , it's good as well . Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , that's true .
D :  Um you have we could
D :  if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ?
D :  Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  I I mean it its uh I that's an interesting idea , it's like the old Swatch watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before . Um that's yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I
B :  I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product .
A :  W I mean we we can uh uh b but I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time . Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
C :  What if we included the batteries in the cover ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh yeah . I like that . That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers and yeah .
C :  So um like
C :  Yeah , so can I see that thing ? Just this as examples .
B :  Um .
A :  Yeah , yeah , I n I know the only p I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together and it it it you know , total reliability , but I mean I d I I uh
C :  So f
B :  Uh yeah .
C :  Yeah , I guess that's
B :  Mm .
C :  true .
A :  I know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from .
D :  Or well , but like uh like more than just the battery , like a complete different like you've only got like , you know like th uh this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip and this is the microphone . And then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees . And then
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I th I s I think if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about uh even if it costs slightly more than that , um just building the whole thing in one , then having getting cheaper production costs um and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally . Um then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote .
D :  Yeah , you probably are right .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , that's true .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . So , yeah .
A :  Yeah , I mean it is it's up to it's up to
C :  Yeah , just another five Euro to get
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item . Um and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available . And um
B :  Mm .
C :  Right .
B :  Mm , yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly . Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly .
A :  that's that's right , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah , like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours . Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So uh i so uh okay . Um right , sorry . Um we hadn't finished your
D :  Um oh , don't worry it's all said , I was just gonna say uh yeah , are we gonna make this as part of like like uh a part of the f like it it the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ?
A :  It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me .
B :  Mm . Mm-hmm .
A :  Um this is fashionable . I , you know , I'm I'm I'm with it , I'm up to date . And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design , um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control , this is , you know , a fashion accessory . Um ,
D :  Yeah . This is fashionable with
B :  Yeah .
A :  so I mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else , um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing .
B :  Mm .
A :  And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , you know , t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . Um
B :  Mm .
D :  Oh yeah .
A :  mm or uh 'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a Real Reaction remote control , I want one of those .
B :  I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it , but I'd yellow seems a bit of a strong colour to make the ent like the thing no , but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . Yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah uh the the uh or or b
C :  Yeah , like an .
A :  Yeah , I'd I'd um yeah . Uh no I d I I agree , I mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  And make that a fashion symbol as well .
C :  Well n
A :  Well , th this is this is the whole point , yes , you know , I'm I've got a a Real Reaction uh remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever . And uh then people , you know , people demand more Real Reaction stuff .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse . So that , you know , when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and
B :  Mm . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  have the power , wherever , somewhere .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I mean I've uh yeah .
C :  I mean that was just an idea that I had .
A :  Oh no that well there's the sim my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , maybe . Kind of a c
B :  Yeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip . So maybe it'd be
A :  W it I mean well it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse , but held , you know , so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons .
C :  Yeah . Sort of a combination .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , and fiddle around with it and press it .
C :  Yeah so yeah , kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had
B :  Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an yeah .
C :  Yeah , then wider up here . And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something . What do you guys think about that ?
B :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , cool .
D :  Yeah , that sounds
A :  Okay , yeah , yeah .
D :  Um I'm just I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to . I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ?
C :  Oh yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  It's a very good point .
C :  It is a very good point .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . That um the we n we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form , but that uh yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone-esque , yeah , yeah .
A :  Then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah , and just say
D :  Yeah , maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice .
B :  Mm .
A :  I th I th honest uh my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway um .
D :  Mm I suppose , but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ or the contrast needs changing .
A :  It's cer it's certainly possible I mean , but they we we're going beyond w w given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work um .
B :  Mm .
D :  Hmm yeah .
B :  Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . I mean uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness and and sc and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff .
A :  Uh
D :  Yeah , that's a good idea .
C :  Yeah , I suppose I sup
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  If we we're I mean I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available .
C :  So I guess we could have a menu button as well . We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume .
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh uh uh
A :  Okay , if we if we're going down that route , then
A :  we need some sort of display . Do we need some sort of display ? We actually use the television , okay . Okay , okay , okay .
B :  But the television would be the display that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's on the T_V_ , yeah .
C :  Yeah , and then y
D :  Well I mean on a onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button .
A :  Yep .
B :  Yeah , yeah , that's true .
C :  Yeah , press that is t yeah , that might work . Yeah , it's like um yeah , it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . You just press it .
B :  I never understood how that worked though , but yeah .
B :  Yeah , mm .
C :  Yeah , and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select .
B :  Mm , oka yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh yeah .
C :  You know what I mean ?
A :  Mm yeah . Okay , we got five minutes to go in this meeting , so um I d I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um .
C :  Okay .
B :  Cool .
A :  So um b b Kate and Kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough , whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic . Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete , but that's a slightly inappropriate word um to something that we can we can see and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control .
B :  Play with play-dough .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Uh can I just get some things clear just for my sake . Our energy source is gonna be
A :  Yeah , certainly , of course .
A :  I think I think we decided that we're gonna for for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um , I you know , on the basis that um that , you know , if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years and that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years um .
D :  long term .
B :  Mm .
D :  Cool . Uh
B :  Yeah .
D :  And we're having a custom chip ?
A :  We're having a
A :  a custom chip , but given the the we've cut the functions down , um that will hopefully not be too problematic , but given that um technol technological innovation is important , then we need to , I'll say it again , technologically innovate .
A :  Um and uh we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um .
D :  And interchangeable case ?
A :  I i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept . Um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . And uh i you know , i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh I mean uh uh this is totally new . We d we don't know whether
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm , mm-hmm .
A :  that to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway , and uh and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , then uh you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets , I won't mention any mention any names , um it's uh it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better .
D :  And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or
A :  Um the that I mean that's no , because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant .
C :  Yeah , I think so too . Yeah , and especially for making them so like different and
B :  Mm , does actually , yeah , yeah .
D :  Cool .
B :  Mm different to feel , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah , yeah . And the you know , that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , 'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life , so no , I mean given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually uh uh unnecessary I think .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . Yep , yeah . Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just
A :  As uh as wide cer certainly wider angle than than current , so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know , i i it will work most of the time um .
B :  Yeah .
D :  As wide as possible .
C :  Like this or like this .
B :  Mm yeah .
A :  Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work .
A :  Um yeah , I mean I d I th I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh .
C :  Yeah , kinda like this whole
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , mm .
A :  Um so
C :  So you could use like this and it would go .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , 'cause I mean the r reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it , the chances are , so if if they're holding it anyway , the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it , then uh then that that's the sort of coverage that we want .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um okay , d we're all clear where we go from here .
C :  Yep .
B :  Yep , sounds good .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so thank you very much indeed and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes .
B :  'Kay .
C :  Okay .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Right well .
A :  Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here and uh
A :  we'll just go through the the final uh the final details . Um okay , oh the um
A :  th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read , um
A :  Okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh
A :  uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close . Um
A :  So f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals .
B :  Uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . Uh this is the power key , um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  Uh that's the little menu key . This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand . Um the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . Um .
A :  Yep , yeah , good , good .
A :  Uh-huh . Yep , right .
A :  Uh-huh .
C :  Mm . S
A :  Yep , yep , mm-hmm .
C :  And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , so they kinda just stretch over .
B :  Mm .
A :  Uh-huh . Yep yep .
A :  Yep .
A :  showing me age , I don't know what i c iPod covers are like . Yeah yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , well I I didn't know that but yeah they're kind of it's just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well and
A :  Uh-huh . Okay , yep , right .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine .
A :  Okay .
C :  just kinda stretch it over
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay , good yeah .
C :  and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yep , right .
B :  Li that'll be the covers as well , yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah , yeah . I mean tha it's it's a detailed point , I just wondered I mean h how will people put these down I wonder ? Right .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Like that .
A :  Okay for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but uh uh
B :  Yeah it could stand , yeah . Well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that .
C :  Oh .
A :  Yeah , uh no because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh
B :  Yeah , standing .
B :  Yeah , we could just widen it out uh
A :  Yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them um because actually have several upon the uh
B :  Mm . Mm .
D :  Could have one for your stereo , one for your D_V_ player .
B :  Mm , yeah , yeah . Have to if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there .
A :  Yeah , well .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , just kind of
A :  Yeah but that that's uh but uh no the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh yeah yeah , no no , I mean that's these uh
C :  Or just make it little .
B :  Yeah , mm . Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Somewhere like that
C :  so it just sort of
B :  We might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that . Yeah .
D :  Yeah I kinda had a
D :  a kinda a natural kind of a idea where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , yeah , kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant for the more natural kinda
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the
B :  Mm .
C :  .
B :  The final product would actually stand up , yeah .
A :  Yeah , yeah , yeah , I mean it it's uh wouldn't wouldn't do that , indeed yeah . But th th but th yeah th b the these were all minor minor uh minor details , I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on and the i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different . Um , so good that's that that's excellent . Um right let us um
C :  fall over .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  .
B :  Yeah .
C :  'S a little longer .
B :  Wee
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  What's on the next one ? Oh right yes , let's have a look at the um
A :  f finance . Um , now
A :  we're given a a clear design brief , uh
A :  if I get the uh spreadsheet up .
A :  Oh .
D :  Uh yeah , just click there .
A :  .
D :  Uh the
D :  the maximise button .
A :  Oh right . Ah .
A :  Good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand . Now I've um this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , um I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour . Uh , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um
A :  we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so , um that I don't think is a a serious problem . The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um
A :  l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . Um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . Um and uh
A :  we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um
A :  slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well I do don't know that they're special colour . Anyway the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the
A :  uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Okay , uh .
A :  So um .
A :  Does anybody want to uh uh Andrew do you want what do you want to say about um
A :  the uh yeah the evaluation where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ?
D :  Evaluation .
D :  The the product or the project ?
A :  The the the well the I meant the product .
D :  Um , well well my presentation just now ? Sure , uh can I get the
A :  Yeah . Oh sorry yeah um , mm .
D :  Cheers .
A :  Mm .
A :  More loud clicks in the microphone .
D :  There we go , oh .
D :  Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to
D :  set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . So
D :  what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard
D :  um gauge
D :  our team response to these questions . So , on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false .
A :  Seven being a nice round number to work to .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And then at the end just take an average
A :  On for true and seven for flase .
D :  Yes .
A :  Yes .
D :  So uh .
D :  So , look at these questions . Is the device f flashy and fashionable ?
A :  Well I think most definitely .
B :  Yeah I'd say definitely a one yeah .
C :  I think it is yeah .
D :  So uh and also uh technologically innovative ?
A :  Yes the voice technology indeed .
B :  Yeah , defi yeah , yeah
C :  Yeah .
D :  Easy to use ?
A :  I don't see we could've made it any easier .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh suitable for the consumer ? That was um
A :  Totally .
B :  Yeah definitely .
C :  Yeah I think it made we met all of the consumer
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  wants .
D :  Uh is it complicated ?
A :  No .
C :  No .
D :  Doing pretty well so far aren't we ? Uh functional ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah definitely .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um .
D :  Where are we ?
A :  found easily . yeah I mean that's that's
D :  We've b built in the the speech , where are you , function .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  Does it take long to learn to use ? Shouldn't .
B :  No , not at all .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And uh , what else ? The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards , well .
A :  Less buttons so it must be .
B :  Uh
D :  We we uh yeah it was our it was a we made an actual effort to
B :  Yeah it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well .
C :  Yeah .
B :  yeah .
A :  So yeah , um um .
D :  Um will device appeal to all age groups ?
A :  I think it will because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so
B :  Mm .
C :  I think so .
D :  Yeah , uh that's a good call , yeah . Well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  And it's it's it's well I don't think we're actually
A :  charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so
B :  I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but um I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's uh yeah yeah so I I yeah I
C :  Yeah I think just the simplicity of it and
B :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , so I think we can reasonably say it's another another one , why not ?
B :  Mm .
D :  Uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ? Uh , yeah and what h did we make the management's
A :  in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement is t it's television only , it's it's simple to use , um it's it's it's within budget , um I it's uh yes an an any minor points we we we argue .
B :  Yep .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Under the cost .
B :  Mm-hmm . Yep .
D :  Um .
A :  So uh I I think we've done an amazing job in uh
B :  Yep .
D :  Okay .
B :  Well done us .
A :  coming up with what
D :  So uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . Eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one .
C :  Yeah , .
A :  Need a need a calculator for that .
D :  And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product .
B :  Excellent .
A :  Okay , nick the cable back then . Ooh . Right do um
C :  I mixed up the colours a little bit .
B :  Oh no that's
C :  I think I all wrong .
A :  either of you want to uh say anything ?
B :  Uh .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
A :  Before I uh
C :  Ps I don't think so , I mean I think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and you know , seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus and
A :  No .
B :  .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well that's right , I mean th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity , I mean I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows . Um I won't comment on leadership , uh teamwork I think we've uh I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together . Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , uh I think the results speak for itself and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh
B :  Mm . Yeah , definitely .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
A :  uh a new approach . Um are the costs within budget ? Yes . Is the project evaluated ? We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um
B :  Yep .
A :  Thank you very much indeed , I think that I think that's uh I think we can go f for an early bath . So I call the meeting closed .
B :  Cool , thank you ,
C :  Alright .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there .
