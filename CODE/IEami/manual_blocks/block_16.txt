A :  Mm-hmm ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Ooh .
B :  So we're 'kay ? On the or
B :  No . I dunno where to put it 'cause the
B :  Okay . Could you s take it off ? .
D :  Is that alright ?
D :  or
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Keeps coming off . 'S fiddly .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Right .
A :  How do we sta wa how do we start ?
A :  Does anybody know ?
D :  Oh , another one .
A :  So that's this
A :  Oh okay , right .
B :  Are we free to take notes uh
B :  Okay .
A :  Uh .
A :  .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Okay , just hang on a second everybody . I haven't actually looked at this yet .
D :  Ah .
A :  um
D :  Very nice .
A :  I haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens .
A :  If you're all ready .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So is the agenda ? Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing .
A :  Project aim is a new remote control . It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly . Project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , individual work and a meeting .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Tool training .
A :  Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um .
A :  Uh Miss Industrial Designer , would you like to go first ?
B :  Okay .
B :  So are we supposed to bring the little things for the
A :  Yeah , why don't you just c , I think just clip on clip do you have a belt ?
D :  Clip .
B :  Mm .
A :  Or put 'em in your pocket , yeah .
B :  Yeah . okay . So my favourite animal
A :  Yeah , what's your favourite animal ?
B :  'Kay um
D :  Ah .
A :  Is it rude ?
D :  It's an elephant .
A :  That's a very good elephant .
C :  The back end of an elephant .
D :  Oh my gosh , I'm never gonna be able to draw that well .
A :  'Kay , and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal .
B :  Um okay , it's big , it's got a great memory .
D :  Does it ? Oh .
B :  Supposed to have a great memory , we say an elephant never forgets . And uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me . Nice animal .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Okay . Wonderful , well done . Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off ?
B :  Okay .
A :  And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ?
C :  Aesthetic yep , sure .
D :  I have no idea what my favourite animal is .
C :  'Kay , my favourite animal , uh let's see .
D :  Oh .
D :  It's
C :  Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before . It's a liger , a combination of a lion and tiger . Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ? Oh it's a hilarious movie . You have to see it . And
D :  A what ?
A :  No .
D :  Alright .
D :  How .
A :  No .
D :  No .
B :  No .
C :  and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much
C :  the awesomest
C :  animal .
C :  But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it .
A :  Okay , well done .
D :  Great .
D :  Me ?
A :  Yeah . Miss mar Miss Marketing ?
D :  Okay .
D :  Not quite sure how this is gonna work .
C :  There go .
D :  Cool . Uh well I'll try my best to draw .
D :  Can I just draw the face ?
A :  Um yeah , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks .
D :  Ooh .
D :  It's a cat . Which also has what ? A big fat body and
A :  That's a very pr pretty cat .
D :  big and a long tail .
A :  Okay , do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it ?
D :  Why ? Because um cuddly .
D :  And usually cats are very friendly . Usually .
D :  And they're healing as well . They heal . And they can feel when a human's got problems so
A :  Wow , so they're kinda spiritual .
D :  So , that's why I like cats .
A :  Well done .
D :  There we are , that's me .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
A :  Um , I don't actually have a favourite animal , but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh .
A :  I honestly can't draw for toffee . Uh .
B :  Really ? Oh that's a
A :  Yeah .
A :  no no uh
C :  A prairie dog ? Oh a squirrel ?
A :  That's exactly what it is . Uh not a very good one
B :  Not bad I would say .
C :  Yeah , that's pretty good .
A :  Okay , well , you got it's a s
A :  It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute
A :  and stupid .
B :  Very good .
D :  Ah .
C :  Alright .
A :  Right . Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working .
A :  Mm . Let's move on to the next page . Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros .
D :  Market range internationally sold .
A :  Yeah . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make .
D :  Ah right okay .
A :  experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ?
A :  Stuff like that .
A :  Next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
A :  At quarter to twelve .
C :  So I think before we close uh , we are expected I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our
C :  what our ideas where . I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . Uh
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I think we're I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for
A :  Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay . I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would
C :  roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe .
A :  Okay . Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ?
A :  Pretty much everybody .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I think we've all got
D :  Uh .
A :  Um .
B :  Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ?
D :  Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control .
B :  Okay .
D :  Well .
A :  'Kay um .
D :  A new remote control for T_V_ .
D :  What would I like ? Um .
A :  W what
A :  You want it big do you want it small .
D :  Medium .
A :  Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something .
A :  Video and ts hi-fi and stuff .
A :  Maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices ,
D :  Mm .
A :  but that would p that would probably be quite expensive .
B :  But how do we know how much uh , I mean , how much do we have per how much ? Twelve fifty .
D :  Twelve fifty .
C :  It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit .
D :  Each .
A :  Per unit , yeah .
C :  Cost .
B :  So do we have to be realistic within the budget or
B :  Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . Yeah .
A :  Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things .
D :  Guess
B :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
D :  Couldn't we have like one that comes out ?
D :  Like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick . I mean remote controls can be thin bits . And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out . have slides . And then it all comes compact
B :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Okay , that's .
D :  into one . So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically .
A :  Th that's an idea .
D :  So you just flip them out .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated .
A :  Okay .
A :  One side for kids , one side for adults .
C :  I'm not sure if that's like
B :  Yeah . Or grandma as well , you know it's like what is the mute button .
C :  I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it .
B :  No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but
C :  Oh .
C :  Oh okay .
A :  Like it or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  That would be cool . I was thinking that like a flip .
A :  F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um , oh we've got five minutes left .
B :  Start breaking up .
D :  Okay . Um .
A :  But okay .
A :  Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there .
C :  Yeah , we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate
D :  .
A :  Yeah .
C :  D_V_D_ players , things like that .
A :  I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Right .
A :  What do you reckon ?
C :  Yeah , I mean .
A :  See 'cause , I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make .
C :  Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um
A :  I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker .
C :  have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , uh simple to use , and looks decent and
A :  Yeah .
A :  May w you know , maybe even
D :  But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? I mean if it's if it's just like
A :  Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for
C :  Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people ,
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  certain certain demographic
A :  Or just one that looks really fucking cool .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , no I think you're right .
B :  Could be really light or , I dunno , something special .
C :  Yeah , rathe rather than focus on
A :  Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should
C :  Y
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I mean obviously everyone we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's
C :  Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , that's right . Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but that's not gonna happen .
D :  I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone's the television switched on or something . So maybe something that like
D :  does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something .
A :  Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it . So make it Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's true what you were saying , I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  And even for kids as well . It's um it's safer for them , I guess . Like they don't flick onto
D :  channels and all that sl flick onto .
A :  No porn channel for children . Okay . Um alright , so we've got some ideas , we've got um
B :  Okay .
C :  I guess that's good good for now .
A :  Let's move on .
D :  Mm .
A :  Oops , let's close that . Next meeting , uh okay .
D :  W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ?
A :  Industrial Designer um which is
D :  Ah ri okay . these are requirement specification .
B :  That's
A :  Um .
D :  And I'm marketing .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , there you go . So
A :  User Interface Designer , that's that's that's you , so you gotta you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um .
C :  That's me . Okay .
C :  Right . Right .
A :  Industrial Designer , you are the one , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um
A :  whether it's what goes into the box , somehow .
B :  Mm . Har how it works an
A :  And in marketing
D :  These are requirement specification .
A :  User requirements specifications .
D :  So what the user requires
A :  Yeah , what
B :  Do you think our two kind of overlap , because
D :  in a remote .
A :  Right , okay , yeah .
C :  Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap .
D :  I guess that's what it says .
A :  You two you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you working together .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that .
D :  Mm .
A :  Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . Okay .
A :  Okay everyone , well done . Good meeting .
C :  Alright , see you in thirty minutes .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So , do we take these off ?
B :  I don't
A :  Think we can first
B :  Mm .
C :  Right it was function F_ eight or something .
C :  This one right there .
B :  Okay . Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Think we all
C :  Huh .
B :  You will as well ?
C :  Oh I thought we all were . Yeah , I have one too , okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  .
B :  Yep .
D :  .
C :  Whoops I forgot to put the thing on
A :  Right . I just wanna 'cause basically I can't re I've really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again . just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll you know . So
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay I'm
C :  Yeah . Sure , that's a good idea .
B :  Okay .
B :  I'm Catherine with a C_ . C_A_T_H_
B :  I_N_E_ .
A :  Okay , and Gabriel .
C :  Uh Gabriel .
A :  E_L_ is it ?
C :  E_L_ .
A :  'Kay .
A :  And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_
D :  I am Reissa . R_E_I_S_S_A_ .
D :  Double S_ A_ , yeah yeah . Sorry .
A :  Okay .
A :  'S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think . Uh , right .
B :  Right .
B :  True .
D :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . I am your Project Manager , and , uh yeah , I'm just here to
A :  sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . Um right , this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last
A :  wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive . So we're gonna each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . Um .
D :  Mm .
A :  Then we're gonna work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it .
B :  How long is the meeting ?
A :  This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can .
B :  Okay .
B :  No problem .
A :  Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 'Cause I don't . Uh okay . So um . You okay over there ? Reissa , are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ?
D :  I'm fine . Yeah .
D :  I uh yeah , yeah . D I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation .
C :  Think she's finishing up her presentation .
D :  No no .
D :  Uh I'm done . Okay .
A :  Okay , jolly good . Alright , let's have um well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . I think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . So that's gonna be you Catherine , if we wanna hear from you first .
D :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Um just connecting this .
B :  Are we getting i
A :  You don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go .
B :  Really ? Okay . Cool . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh
B :  Uh .
B :  Okay .
B :  So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've oh no , you can't see a thing . Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it . We it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um the idea is that we've got the
C :  Oh .
A :  Ah .
B :  energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called six , or something like that . Uh and then
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  um
B :  then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh
B :  an infra-red signal ,
B :  um which will be sent by an electronic chip .
B :  And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface .
B :  So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um and that's it really for the working design .
A :  Great . Okay .
B :  Sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but
A :  I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . Yeah .
B :  Really ? Cool .
B :  Um , should I erase this or
A :  Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down . Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ?
B :  Okay .
B :  Fine .
B :  Or suggestions ?
D :  Is a battery like
D :  the only way of
B :  Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s
C :  Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or
B :  In indoors .
A :  Yeah , you blow on it and i
D :  No , no
D :  No I meant like
C :  Bicycle power .
D :  No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . The battery's down and maybe , I dunno , solar charged ?
B :  I dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but
A :  Yeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .
D :  Mm . Yeah .
C :  One question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .
A :  How far away is your television ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far , does it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .
C :  Uh
B :  Well , the thing is uh you you don't
D :  Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room .
C :  That's true .
B :  Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it .
B :  I didn't think about that
D :  How about Bluetooth ?
B :  but
D :  Instead of using infra-red ,
D :  use Bluetooth .
B :  Why not ?
D :  Isn't that a better signal ?
B :  I just think that it's it's gonna cost more and I'm I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it .
A :  Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . You know we don't need it .
D :  Mm .
B :  It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , you are gonna
A :  Yeah , exactly . Basically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . It's uh
B :  But
D :  Mm .
B :  Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i
B :  We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't
D :  'S just an idea .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .
C :  Okay .
B :  Do you need the border ?
C :  Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .
B :  Okay .
B :  Sorry .
C :  Technical . Okay .
D :  Adjusting .
C :  Okay , so , while this is warming up , there it is uh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So I'm doing the user interface design .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at
C :  looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there .
C :  Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that ,
C :  the basic functionality that people want .
C :  Um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control ,
C :  um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function . Uh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility .
A :  Okay .
C :  And so in the research that I was doing
C :  there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you uh .
C :  Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame . Uh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do , you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . And I judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Great .
C :  So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa , because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . So uh , yeah , that's me .
D :  Mm .
D :  .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Great . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or
C :  No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones . That was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality .
C :  I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?
A :  Um
A :  I would say
A :  it's
A :  If it's simple to do ,
A :  which I think it probably should be , even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , it's like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , but you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  'Kay .
C :  Right .
C :  Mm .
A :  You know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .
D :  Mm .
C :  Right .
C :  And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .
A :  We put the fashion in electronics . There you go .
D :  Mm .
C :  I think I think we have to carry that mental .
A :  So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
C :  Well yeah these , I think , we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .
A :  Yeah . Because we need
A :  Yeah . Great .
C :  Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .
A :  Okay , fantastic . Right , well done , Gabriel . Um Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .
D :  Okay .
D :  .
D :  Where does it go into ?
C :  .
D :  Here ? The blue thing .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , yeah , this is getting all . Mm .
D :  .
C :  Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .
D :  Well , function F_ eight .
D :  No oh .
C :  Yeah , it just takes a second uh .
A :  Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while .
D :  Come on .
D :  Right . Okay . . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user .
D :  So , they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't
D :  like match how people behave . Um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .
A :  'Cause we've only got five channels .
D :  exactly . That's another thing . Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap .
D :  Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like .
A :  I think that's k flicking quickly between channels .
C :  Yeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . So maybe tracking devices is a good idea . Um personal preferences .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Wow . You are a child of technology , aren't you ?
D :  Um so yeah um I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find , so I don't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating .
D :  So voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age , sorry , age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes . Um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .
A :  So there you go , yeah .
A :  Uh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't . It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and
C :  No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .
D :  Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so
A :  People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it .
A :  Um but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years . Um d and tha and that's a that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .
C :  Yeah , that would be my guess as well .
D :  So they don't
D :  Well
D :  These guys are growing up .
C :  What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit . I mean , okay , there's
A :  Yeah .
D :  Voice activation might not be the best .
A :  I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .
C :  Uh .
D :  Um also with um with buttons , a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense Huh ?
C :  Repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing
D :  Yeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . I don't think so .
B :  Well maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then .
A :  So y so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .
D :  Yeah maybe not so hard .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
B :  Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a
D :  Yeah .
A :  Let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .
D :  Maybe
C :  Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . They're having a lunch break at the moment , but yeah . I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm . Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . That's great , thank you very much for that , Reissa . Um okay , so we've basically
D :  So that is me .
A :  we've decide we've d
A :  we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . It's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look cool . It's gotta be cheap . S um .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um .
A :  But a in there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . So
B :  Yep .
A :  I think we're all um pretty sussed on that .
A :  anyone have any questions ? Everybody happy in their work ?
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page .
A :  Now this is good , we've got a good structure going on . We all know where we're going to . Have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ?
C :  Oh it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager .
B :  .
D :  Well , just questionnaires .
C :  Sell trying to sell your things .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , stuff . Um okay . Do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ?
D :  Yeah , you can .
A :  Right . Do all you all know my e-mail address ?
C :  Okay .
C :  No I don't . I
D :  I think he's participant one , aren't you ?
B :  Well , in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , I think . So Project Manager , it's participant one at A_M_I_ .
C :  Uh
C :  Oh , it's just participant one oh okay . Yeah .
A :  Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ?
C :  Well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one , participant two .
B :  You have them i you have them , but we'll send you an e-mail . You want to have friends , don't you ?
A :  .
A :  Send me , yeah yeah , okay .
C :  So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that .
A :  Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , but I might be just going a bit
C :  Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . Maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves .
A :  Okay . Well ,
B :  It wouldn't be
A :  maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas ?
C :  Mm .
D :  Can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of a certain ?
C :  Mm .
A :  Well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . It's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product .
D :  But if it's a R_R_ , it would be Real Reaction , like if it had a symbol on it .
C :  Mm .
A :  There's loads of companies that called R_R_ .
C :  Mm .
D :  Whoa .
A :  This is slog but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type .
C :  And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So we have to have it one colour .
A :  Well , not necessarily . But we have to incorporate it .
C :  Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable .
D :  Mm .
A :  Not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product . It's got to so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps .
B :  Well you could
D :  Mm .
B :  It could come
B :  But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  If .
A :  Quite poss yeah . Well this is all your department .
A :  Mm okay . Well , well done everybody . And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now .
C :  .
C :  Yeah , pretty soon I think , I guess that's now .
D :  Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ?
A :  We might possibly have done .
B :  Cool .
C :  Alright , see you all soon .
A :  If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch .
D :  'Kay uh .
A :  Yeah , there you go .
A :  Right . I just have to there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down , but
A :  Take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em .
D :  Oh right okay .
D :  I cover myself up .
A :  I feel like Madonna with one of these on . I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on .
D :  .
D :  I've always wanted one of these , I really have . Where do you buy 'em from ?
D :  They're .
A :  Right . Hello everybody . Back again for another wonderful meeting . Is uh everyone ready ? Okay , we c we can hold on for a minute .
C :  Hello .
B :  .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Almost .
D :  Oh my gosh .
D : 
A :  I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in .
C :  That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive .
B :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Are you ready ?
A :  Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now . Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on .
A :  Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um
A :  now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Do you have any preference uh of order ?
A :  Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . I want what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and
D :  Batteries .
C :  I think she is still finishing her .
B :  No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing .
A :  It's just that yeah , let's let's hear from you first .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Okay . Where is that thing ? Oh sorry , couldn't see .
C :  Okay , it's uh
D :  It's here .
B :  Would that work ?
A :  Get yourself in position .
B :  Okay , so that's me again . Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah , yeah . It wouldn't be very fancy . You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but
D :  Ah .
A :  I don't think any of us remember the fifties .
C :  Is it like a crank thing or something .
D :  Mm .
C :  Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ?
D :  Mm .
B :  I dunno actually .
A :  Does anybody know ?
C :  Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know .
B :  I dunno .
B :  Um .
B :  Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but I don't know if it's worth the cost . So we've got to discuss that .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay , jolly good .
B :  For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so
A :  What's a double curved one ?
B :  You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing .
B :  So
A :  Okay .
B :  Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex ,
B :  uh rubber , wood , or titanium . And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh
A :  So that might be an idea of using the rubber , but then it should , you know yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Let's have a squeezable remote .
B :  Yeah . And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , I dunno
A :  when a T_V_ programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . Yeah , I like that idea .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  So rubber would be
B :  Okay .
D :  I think rubber's
A :  Rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ?
D :  But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more
A :  Ooh , we like rubber , ooh .
B :  Uh s so if d okay .
D :  People .
B :  And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display .
B :  Um scroll buttons , as well .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . So it's a constraint .
A :  Well , we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so
B :  Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons .
B :  If that makes sense .
A :  push buttons instead of the wheel ?
B :  Yeah . .
C :  If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , it doesn't matter if it's double I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ?
A :  rubble double double .
B :  No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing ,
A :  I'll have a Big Mac , please .
B :  then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons .
C :  Okay .
B :  So , either
B :  I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case .
A :  Let's have rubber push buttons , hey .
C :  Okay . Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way .
B :  Let's go crazy . And then , do I have a last slide ? Yes , I do . Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . Um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Simple , yeah .
A :  Chip on print . It's a bit .
A :  Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here
B :  Mm .
A :  is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ?
B :  .
B :  Yeah .
B :  The infra-red .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right . Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ?
A :  Y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ?
B :  Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . It's less expensive mm
A :  so it sounds
B :  Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too .
A :  So , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit . I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . Um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works ,
B :  It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah .
B :  Totally .
B :  Yeah .
B :  So let's not go for the
B :  Yeah , yeah . I agree .
A :  you know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print .
B :  So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .
A :  Yeah .
A :  S yeah , push buttons .
D :  What about the just developed uh sample sensor ?
C :  I think push-buttons is
A :  What about what ?
D :  G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing .
B :  Well
A :  Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?
D :  Mm , I dunno .
D :  Be cool . Channel two .
B :  It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and
C :  Yeah .
C :  Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh , 'cause uh
A :  Yeah . It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product .
C :  The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um
C :  That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever . But , I mean , it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns comes on , but it's not that . It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response . So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's
A :  Yeah .
B :  Hm .
D :  Oh , it just gives an answer .
D :  Oh , then then
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I thought I thought it was when they said
B :  Just if you are really lonely , maybe .
D :  I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , channel five , and it will change . Like you talk to it . Can I have channel five ? Oh , then forget about it . Oh right okay .
B :  Channel five . And then it switches on .
C :  No , tha that w that w that would be more promising . It it's just a remote that talks to you . Uh . I mean to certain cues .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the
C :  'Kay .
C :  Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery .
A :  Basic battery . It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work .
D :  Mm .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Cheaper option . Are you happy with that ? Okay . So we'll go for the battery .
D :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?
A :  We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ?
C :  Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved .
A :  The the
D :  So it will look like something like this .
B :  Double ?
A :  The double whopper , please .
B :  Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , and that's fine ?
A :  Yep , but we're going for the simple buttons .
C :  So rubber rubber keys , yeah .
A :  Yeah . And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ .
C :  Yeah .
D :  .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So that's another marketing point that we can use .
D :  Well the rubber push-buttons .
D :  Don't you have to move your
A :  But anything is gonna have buttons .
D :  Mm .
A :  Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive .
B :  I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a
A :  You
A :  You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . It's not actually what you are doing .
B :  That they don't .
B :  Mm .
C :  .
A :  But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific
D :  Mm . Yeah , the rubber's good .
C :  Yeah . We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , so they can sit there and go like
C :  Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful .
A :  And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah .
C :  Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports .
B :  Alright , that's me done .
A :  Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface .
C :  Alright .
C :  Alright .
C :  Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about .
A :  Great .
B :  Sorry .
C :  Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine .
A :  Mm .
C :  So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . It's it's pointless .
A :  Mm .
C :  Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . Um the other suggestion , and I I have a feeling that
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  That does get annoying .
C :  we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or , or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . Uh um
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So , the key layout and design are really crucial . You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout
C :  from our manufacturing department . So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  it's sort of confusing for the user . Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . And for something for kids .
A :  Do we have an uh example of a good one ?
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  Brilliant .
D :  Well
C :  Yeah . Um .
A :  Yeah .
C :  And so ,
C :  yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . I think it should be more general . I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . And , yeah , that's it for me .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . Well let's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? The um
A :  The the um the interface type we're going for
C :  So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um .
A :  Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons .
C :  I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Uh .
C :  And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , and we're not yeah . Are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether
C :  Well now that we've decided on our
A :  w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something
C :  Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , but um
A :  We're
D :  Maybe we can
C :  Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Okey-dokey .
A :  Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this .
A :  Let's move over to
C :  I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . But I think that should be I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . So that should be simple .
A :  Yeah , sure .
A :  .
A :  Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah .
A :  Cool .
D :  Right .
D :  Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets
A :  Mm yeah .
D :  and what the fashions are for next year . Um .
D :  So yes , so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed . Um the most important aspect is look and feel . So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . So it has to be
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ?
D :  Yep .
C :  Mm .
D :  Exactly . Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . So
C :  Yeah .
A :  What's that mean ?
D :  Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . It should work .
C :  Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market .
D :  Should
D :  That's new .
A :  Okay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , 'cause our rubber one is not fancy I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction . And it's it's not technologically innovative either .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So , no loose
A :  Maybe we could um
C :  Mm .
D :  That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know ,
D :  at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .
A :  Of course , they do . One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not .
D :  Well , they do , but it's like it's not
D :  Yeah , but it looks good . If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration .
A :  Okay , well , what do you two think about this ?
C :  So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other
D :  But like
C :  electronics ?
A :  Yeah , what I don't understand what m
D :  You could always insert , yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , right ?
A :  Yeah , and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television .
D :  Yeah , but , I mean , people like
A :  It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , does it ?
D :  Well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .
B :  Well
A :  That would mean we'd have to make a television as well .
B :  Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now .
B :  Things like that .
A :  No , that would be your telephone in with your television .
B :  No i
C :  Yeah , the that wouldn't be the remote so much , I mean
A :  Yeah , and i
B :  No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to
A :  Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . An and there is no there is no such thing .
B :  I with the television , yeah . I was just trying to find an advantage . Wha what w what advantage would you get for the
C :  Mm .
D :  Well , it doesn't
D :  Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . Whether it's a battery it could be something really
D :  really minor , you know , like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have
A :  Okay .
D :  and um just go creative .
B :  Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet .
A :  Okay . Yeah , this that's that's very good .
D :  And then you can market it . Never have to change a battery again .
B :  Change the batteries ever again .
A :  And and this is all tying in very nicely . The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it .
B :  Yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much .
C :  Yes , so can
D :  I think , safety s
A :  But yeah , by the squeezing it the
C :  Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator .
A :  Yeah , that's a great idea . Well done .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use . And I think we've all um worked that out . Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . So next year people will be buying , I found this really funny , you know , strawberry shaped chairs ,
C :  we're all about that .
C :  Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them .
D :  and things .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Rubber things .
A :  I wanna watch the pineapple channel .
D :  Um and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is yeah , so we're in .
C :  .
A :  Well spongy , that's where . Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there .
C :  Yeah , that's great for us .
D :  Yeah . And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically .
D :  So yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  .
D :  I had to say
D :  So we're moving in the right direction like
C :  Right .
A :  Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , so through all that we've we go we're right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
C :  Yeah , that's great .
D :  Mm .
B :  No vegetables .
C :  Yeah , I don't know how we incorporate
A :  .
C :  We don't have to follow every trend , I guess .
D :  Maybe make it like fruity colours or something .
D :  Some sort .
C :  Uh-huh .
D :  Or
C :  The power button could be like a big apple or something .
D :  Mm .
B :  Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that .
A :  Yeah , this is true .
C :  They don they don't own all images of apples .
B :  sued the Beatles so
C :  Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate .
A :  Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is
A :  its image .
C :  .
A :  Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , or like are we going yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ?
D :  Well
D :  I think , if it's rubber
D :  it needs to be
A :  I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky .
D :  different . I think , it's it should be I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? You know like
A :  L keep it clean , keep it clean .
D :  really different colours basically . Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? Um Um like I'm just thinking bright colours .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Bright natural colours , nothing
D :  too
A :  Bright , but not too bright .
D :  Bright , but too not yeah . Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like
C :  Yeah .
A :  Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ?
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah . And on the back of it have the logo .
A :  Okay , what ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Sure .
B :  Why not ?
A :  Okay .
C :  The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ?
A :  Yeah , I mean we that's we we
A :  Yeah .
A :  This is the remote control tomato .
D :  Well
D :  I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool .
D :  Like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um
D :  like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but
A :  Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof .
D :  Yeah . So so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something .
B :  I'm gonna write that down .
C : 
A :  So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the
D :  Yeah .
B :  That's yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour wow . So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . So they also get to pick .
D :  Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour .
C :  Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing .
D :  It's um
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  Although I'd be curious to see how many uh
D :  D you've got the
B :  You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour .
C :  Right .
A :  Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And produce less of the silly colours , maybe .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay . Alright . Well um , we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um
A :  is
A :  from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design .
B :  Yep .
A :  Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design . Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . You won't be going off to your separate offices .
B :  Alright .
C :  Okay .
A :  Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay .
C :  Oh right .
A :  I think , yeah , it's gonna you know , come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . 'Cause at the moment , uh you know , it's it's hard . We were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start ,
B :  Mm .
B :  Cool .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It is .
A :  you know , s some sort of physical something or other .
C :  That sounds good .
A :  Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation .
D :  Evaluation .
A :  Um .
A :  And I
A :  will be uh
A :  talking to the bosses , basically , and uh
A :  f fielding off some more spam and
B :  Great .
A :  that's it really .
A :  Keeping things t well , uh you know , ho hopefully uh keeping things together . Um .
A :  Yeah , that's
A :  This is this is uh good . So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on . We definitely know how it's powered , we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons , we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down . It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky . Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff . People , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite ,
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it . Um .
A :  you know , we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it , you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have ? We'll look into this lock key
C :  Right .
A :  facility , although whether or not it happens , or is possible , I don't know , but something to look into .
A :  Okay . I think that's um well done everybody .
C :  Alright .
A :  Anyone have any uh
A :  any questions , everyone know what they're doing ? 'Cause if you don't , you'll I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm , I think we all know what we need to do now .
D :  This gives you all the details ?
A :  Okay . right well . It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish .
C :  Okay .
A :  But um
A :  I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just
C :  Okay , I'll stay in here .
D :  um .
A :  hold hold fire . Um .
C :  Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that
A :  Um I think , it's uh , yeah , I think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product .
C :  So we're buying fut I mean , we're getting futures in the company .
A :  Yeah , I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment .
C :  So we really have a incentive to make this remote work .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well .
A :  I want a share in the space rocket . Did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship .
C :  Yeah . .
D :  Yeah .
C :  This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , we're definitely not in the money making department .
A :  .
C :  Well I I did notice looking at I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I mean , if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious .
D :  Mm .
C :  R_R_ . Well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black .
A :  Mm .
B :  That's true .
A :  And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it but I still want one .
C :  No .
B :  Doesn't
C :  Mm .
A :  Okay . Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Right , well , I guess that's us .
A :  Yeah . It's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet . So maybe you should go back to your own offices .
C :  Okay . Right .
B :  Are we taking these off ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it says you two
D :  It's Play-Doh .
A :  Play-Doh's edible . Did you know that ? It's definitely
D :  Because kids yeah .
C :  I've , I've definitely eaten it before . I didn't know was edible . .
B :  I used to eat it .
A :  Yeah .
D :  But um , it's it's made edible 'cause , yeah .
A :  It's it's chew proof .
D :  It's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then
A :  Yeah .
D :  Well , normal babies .
C :  Actually that makes sense , because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah it is , yeah . Oh yeah .
A :  Right . Everybody everybody ready ? Okay , let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
C :  We've got some .
B :  We've got a cool prototype .
C :  Yeah , it's pretty exciting . So ,
C :  everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , yeah , double curved , um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here .
B :  Double curved .
A :  Nice .
D :  That is cool .
C :  So , basically ,
C :  if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , the thumb button is the power button .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down .
D :  What's the big blue thing ?
C :  That's the lock button , has a L_ L_ on it and then the M_ is a mute button . And then it also has digit
D :  Oh cool .
A :  what button ? Um . Oh mute .
C :  For muting the uh
D :  And mute .
C :  Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different .
A :  Okay .
A :  That certainly does .
C :  So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them . So you don't you
A :  Mm .
B :  Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ .
C :  Yeah . It should be . And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  'S great .
C :  change that . So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it
D :  Oh it's so cute .
A :  I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one .
B :  Oh right , yeah .
C :  Ah , that's good thinking , yeah .
A :  But , that's I don't see why that's not possible .
C :  Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes .
A :  Yeah . They make left-handed scissors , you know .
C :  Yeah , I didn't I didn't think about that , but I'd yeah , .
D :  Yeah , but then
D :  but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ?
A :  Yes s
B :  Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse .
A :  Mm . Sure . Sure .
D :  Yeah , I'm sure they'll be able to
C :  Uh-huh .
D :  I mean it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so
C :  Yeah .
B :  Imagine d are you right handed ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , I don't think it's too
D :  Yeah , it's not
B :  But we can have both uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  Have them in stock .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Make 'em more appealing as well .
A :  But um other than that , I mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , I think I think it's great , yeah , great idea .
C :  Do you think it says R_R_ ?
B :  I think it does .
A :  I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable .
C :  Fashion to electronics . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue .
C :  Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh .
A :  Yeah .
D :  .
A :  Yeah .
B :  There you go .
C :  So that's that's our end of things wha uh
A :  Yeah , very good , yeah . It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , all seems to be there . Well done .
C :  That's
C :  Yeah .
D :  And all the playing around is uh
A :  Um before we move on
D :  Yeah , I'm just do you wanna plug in ? Okay .
A :  I need that cable . Thank you . Yeah . Um .
A :  One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs .
C :  The costs , was that what you said ?
B :  Play-Doh is very cheap .
A :  Well , yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  um
D :  Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like , oops , it's gone .
C :  But it's edible .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
B :  Chew proof .
D :  Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , .
C :  That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Uh right . Okay , now I think we'll do this I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Oh ho-ho .
B :  Yep .
A :  And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest
A :  thing that's inside it . Ooh . So the case , we've gone for the double curved .
A :  and it's made out of rubber .
A :  The interface is push-buttons .
A :  And button supplements well they're in diff special colours , aren't they ? So special colours .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  It's better for
A :  Special form , yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff .
D :  And special material .
C :  Yeah , I mean , these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so
A :  Yep . Yeah . Um .
A :  Are they made out of any special material ? No they're not . They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple
B :  Rubber .
C :  The buttons are rubber .
D :  Well they're rubber , aren't they ?
A :  Okay . Right . So let's see if that comes within budget . And it does . That is gonna cost uh Yeah . That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . So ,
B :  Yeah .
B :  .
D :  We're under budget .
C :  That's cool .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected .
A :  this is all very very good . The bosses will be very pleased . Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . Uh .
A :  Save it in save it in the uh my documents .
D :  It's already saved , I think .
A :  Splendid . Okay .
A :  So uh , that's done with this with this um doodah , so you're . Gonna do what you were gonna do ,
D :  Thank you .
D :  Mm .
A :  your evaluation .
D :  Oh , yeah . This is where we all get to I get to write on the , oops , on the board . Right . Oh .
D :  'S function
A :  F_ eight .
D :  Okay .
A :  I love the smell of that Play-Doh .
C :  Yeah , have some have some .
D :  Mm .
A :  I cou .
D :  Okay . So , evaluation . We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . I've got the criterias . And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . And the criterias are , and I'll draw this up on the board so we have a box
D :  .
D :  And this is false , this is just like
D :  to keep you informed . So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . So the first criteria . Do you all get what we're doing ? Okay , cool . Okay , first criteria , look and feel . So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? So what mark should we give for that ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
A :  I would give it a seven .
C :  Yeah .
D :  As in it's not .
C :  Oh , sorry , one .
A :  Oh sorry , one , d yeah .
B :  A one .
D :  A one a one . So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . Second criteria , new technology . Have we implemented new technology ? As in the new high-tech
B :  Well , the kinetic thing , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .
A :  .
D :  So it's .
D :  So we'll give it a
B :  Well so the um
C :  It's ergonomic , but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing . So on the technical side of it it
B :  Yeah . Yeah . True .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I'd say it's about a a twoish ? Two . Three .
C :  It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , maybe , yeah , I dunno .
B :  Two .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Maybe three , yeah .
D :  three .
D :  So criteria three is is it easy to use ? I think it's a one , I think .
A :  Easy to use . I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I would give it a I would give it a two , 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but
C :  Mm .
D :  Two , so it's
C :  Okay .
D :  But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ?
B :  Mm .
C :  If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Give it a t give it a two .
D :  Yeah , okay . 'Kay , criteria four is costs . 's great .
A :  Cost . It's come in under budget . So that's a definite one .
C :  Yeah . That was great .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Amount of buttons .
D :  Like the amount of buttons , 'cause people like a lot le like
A :  Contains only the necessary buttons . Yeah .
D :  So it's a one ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um criteria six . R_S_I_ is it good against ? Yes . Very good . It's one . And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ? Is it easy to get lost ?
B :  Yes s yeah .
A :  So it's anti-R_S_I_ .
B :  It's yellow .
C :  It is very bright , yeah .
A :  I don't think it's gonna get lost easily .
D :  No ? But it is smallish .
B :  Two .
C :  It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know .
C :  Maybe it will . Uh .
D :  Mm . I think i it would , could be , could get lost .
C :  You think it could lost
A :  two .
D :  Mm . Yeah . I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say I mean , it's not a one , definitely .
C :  Mm .
A :  I mean it
A :  No , I mean
C :  Okay .
A :  I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but
C :  Yeah , anything , I mean . Okay . It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But , yeah , it can get lost .
D :  The mobiles get lost all the time .
C :  Yeah . Okay , yeah , two is fine .
D :  But then you ring 'em and you find them . So
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Mm . Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . So , that's that .
D :  So that's the evaluation , so I'd say
D :  Yay .
B :  We've , we've done well .
A :  Alright it's all all systems go .
D :  It's like like a number one . Um .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Number one product .
C :  Mm .
D :  All done , thanks .
A :  We can't fail .
D :  We fitted all the criterias . Yeah .
A :  .
D :  Yeah , so
A :  Well done , Reissa .
D :  So that's that one .
A :  Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , you know , both individually and as a team . You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two . That's all , you know , gone very very well and and and be you know , has been good communication going on .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and
A :  Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ?
C :  just just
C :  We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and
B :  Well .
B :  You know
A :  Fantastic .
B :  It is .
C :  Now you guys have been a a great team . Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams , .
D :  been cool .
A :  I think So I I , you know , and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design .
D :  In four diff in in four meetings . Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick .
A :  Yeah .
A :  You know , maybe this isn't a simulation , maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just , yeah , they get
C :  Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote .
D :  They're using our ideas .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , two years' time this will be on the market . Ex exactly that product um thum we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us . But um
C :  So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  No , I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . Or six , uh
B :  Oh really ?
D :  Just start summarising now .
D :  You can reply to the same message .
A :  I haven't got message .
D :  See summary , there . If you just reply to that one .
C :  So there's no way to like predict what our 'Cause we had a we originally had a
C :  As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . It was fifty mil fifty million
D :  Was it was it fifty or five ?
C :  I don't remember . But there's not a way to compute that , I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ?
A :  It gets handed over to another department . What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically . the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget . When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah , the all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah . Um .
D :  Depends how much we sell .
C :  Uh .
C :  Hmm .
C :  But we have a vested interest prof profit sharing .
A :  Yeah , that's it . You know , we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's does everything that we wanted it to do . It's new , it's it's um
D :  We finished an hour earlier .
A :  something that uh that isn't out there already .
C :  I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . We're not we're not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , it's that it's um , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere
D :  Mm .
D :  Definitely .
A :  Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know , so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
C :  It make watching T_V_ healthy .
A :  Yeah , and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ , you can f throw it about , you know . It's fine , it's kid proof .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them .
C :  Uh .
A :  Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that . Yeah . So all in all , I think we've done very well . Well done everybody .
D :  No .
B :  Mm yep .
D :  Yay .
C :  Right , you too .
A :  Um . Drinks are on the company .
B :  Cool .
A :  In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to . Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  Glad to hear that .
A :  That's it . Well , as far as I t as far as I know . Um .
C :  That's it .
D :  Yep .
D :  We haven't got the five minute left thing yet .
A :  No . Anyone wanna play I spy ?
D :  Mm mm .
C :  I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of
C :  silence .
C :  Should we call the day then ?
A :  Yeah , I guess . I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire .
C :  Uh , right .
A :  Um .
A :  It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  In project .
A :  But I'm not the authority to say that it is .
A :  Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ?
D :  I love it . I love it . I think it's cool . Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool .
D :  Being watched . Um
C :  Your moment to shine .
D :  Wow .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I thi you know , I'd I'd n yeah , as we said earlier , I've not never seen that before . something that t the whiteboard
B :  Yeah .
A :  thingy , that's great .
A :  Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . I mean it's i or in such a new idea . It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  Right , I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Mm .
D :  Logitech .
C :  I guess we should end this , since we're off off topic .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So . Shall we
D :  Meeting adjourned .
C :  Right .
A :  Yeah .
