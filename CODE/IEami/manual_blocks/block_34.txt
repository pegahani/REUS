A :  Okay , good morning . This is our first team meeting . I'll be your Project Manager for today , for this project . My name is Mark will be giving this presentation for you to kick the project off . That's my uh that's the agenda for today . Well , of course we're new to each other , so I'd like to get acquainted first . So let's do that first , I mean Let's start with you , can you introduce yourself ? You're our Marketing Expert .
B :  Good day .
D :  Morning .
C :  Morning .
D :  Yes . Um my name is Dirk , Dirk Meinfeld . Um I will be uh Pr Project the Marketing Expert . And I will see what the user wants and uh what we can do uh with the new produ project product .
A :  Okay , excellent . And you are User Interface Yeah .
B :  Nick Broer , User Interface Designer . I'm going to uh look at the technical design from the uh user point of view .
A :  Excellent . Okay .
C :  My name is Xavier Juergens , I'm the Industrial Designer , and there are three main questions that I have to find an answer to today . First one is uh what happens inside the apparatus , second is what is uh the apparatus made of , and the third is what should it look like .
D :  Hmm .
A :  What should it look like ? Okay .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Oh , let's kick it off . Oh , there we go . So , our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I took this off our corporate website . It's I think well it sums up what we need to do .
A :  We're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . That's why our product will always fit in your home . So apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want . So
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So we put the fashion in electronics . So that's what we need to go for . Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . First step will be the functional design . And that's basically what we're gonna do . Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information about So I'm gonna keep this short , since we had a technical problem . So skip through this .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh . Okay . Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have we have the SMARTboards here . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's actually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen .
A :  Like you see here , I'll just take the take here . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want .
A :  It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want .
A :  And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger .
A :  So it should be really easy . This is to take the just take a new slide and back again . We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . So I'll take this out .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever .
A :  So next , been here . Well , gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . So basic idea is
A :  we have a blank sheet . Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal .
A :  I think the creative genius should go first .
B :  The creative genius ? Thank you very much .
A :  So , draw us your favourite animal .
B :  Well , I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing , so I'm not really good at drawing animals , but uh the animal which I Oh .
A :  Draw us a technical animal .
A :  Yeah , it's still erasing .
B :  Pen .
B :  Uh format .
B :  Else my animal will be like king-size . I pretty much like a dolphin , because of its uh its freedom basically . Let's see .
B :  A head .
B :  actually worked with this . It's like uh it's a very
C : 
B :  Uh high-tech . Bit low-responsive though . Prefer pen and paper .
A :  So that's what we don't want . We want a high-responsive product . So
A :  It looks more like nuclear bomb .
D :  Very nice dolphin .
B :  It doesn't look like a nuclear bomb . This thing isn't doing what I'm
C : 
B :  What I want .
B :  So
A :  Let's go easy on it .
B :  Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb .
B :  I'll just finish up real soon , because I'm
B :  So it doesn't really look like a dolphin , but then again , this is all new for me .
A :  Anyway , it should It It's supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it that it represents .
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  Like the ocean , like swimming . Do that in my spare time , so that's basically an
A :  What do you like ? Okay . Well , our Marketing Expert . Show us an animal .
B :  Now we can forget this ever happened .
D :  Um an animal . I like the elephant .
A :  Pick a pick a pick a clean sheet . Oh . Take a clean sheet first .
D :  What ?
D :  Yeah . Um
A :  Just press next . That's it .
D :  Oh yeah . Oh , a blank . Okay , next . Free , I like the elephant . It's big , it's strong , so uh uh Oh , it's a little bit
B :  It's not really that responsive , no .
D :  You have to hold it , right ?
C :  Mm .
D :  Hmm .
D :  It's a beautiful animal .
D :  Oh , you have to p press it pretty hard .
D :  With a smile on it , it's very important .
A :  It's a cute elephant .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And uh not to forget its tail .
D :  Oh .
A :  It's a nice beard .
D :  Yeah , it's okay .
B :  And you was making comments on my dolphin .
D :  Yes .
D :  I will beat the dolphin . No .
A :  Okay , so it's just a bee .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So I suggest you make us the elephant in the market . The big and strong player in the market . This would be good . Okay , excellent . On to the next one .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  Uh yeah .
C :  Okay , you should press next .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Press next . Yeah , it's up there .
C :  Okay .
A :  That's it .
C :  Okay , well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger .
B :  You picked a hard one , didn't you ?
D :  Experience with the tiger .
C :  My drawing skills are really bad , so .
D :  What ? They are
C :  They are really bad , my drawing skills .
D :  Okay uh-huh .
A :  Sure looks smooth .
D :  Oh .
C :  I'm not sure how the legs should go , but
C :  Uh these are stripes .
B :  Got it .
C :  I've picked this animal because it's very fast . It is uh it knows exactly what it wants . Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources .
A :  What does it want ?
C :  Uh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . Uh it knows exactly what it wants . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything , security , speed and efficiency is important . And I think uh those things we can use .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
A :  I agree .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yay , I'm supposed to draw the animal next .
A :  I introduce to the world the amazing
A :  ant .
D :  Uh hard worker .
A :  Great team-workers .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Do everything to Uh really small , but together they're really strong . So I'm gonna give it a smiley face .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Oh .
A :  Not sure where the p . Just put 'em here . Whatever .
A :  Think it need shoes . So
A :  I'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so
A :  That's the coolest ant ever .
B :  You've done this before , haven't you ?
A :  I love to draw ants . It's my hobby . Anyway Nah . Just I think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . Like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Just Yeah . You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . Anyway . another beep to stop the meeting . See . Warning . Finish meeting now .
A :  Uh put this down .
A :  Examples . Well I guess we have a little little time extra , but Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work . So what do you guys think about The first idea is just very short . I'll start with you . What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? What
B :  Well , I basically had a question . Do uh Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in
D :  Uh
A :  The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control .
B :  Just for T_V_ remote control . Okay . Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all . Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it revolutionary changes , yes .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I guess so .
D :  But
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess .
B :  Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add , and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ?
A :  Yeah , we want
A :  I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . So I think I mean , really disabled people , yeah , might be a problem , but I think it's a little take it into consideration . Um yeah . I think we really need to cut the meeting short . You have anything you wanna share quickly ?
C :  Hmm . Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . That's it speaks for itself , but some uh Yeah .
D :  Uh .
B :  Yeah .
A :  It should be light , okay . Um , let's see , where did I Let's skip that . Oh , this is it . Sorry , I skipped this sheet . What do we This Quick What we're going to Selling price , twenty five Euros . That's for you . The production price , twelve and a half Euros , approximately . Just go go for that . We'll reach the uh reach that profit .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Selling price .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay , well that's not that much to work with .
D :  international .
A :  No , it's not much to work on . I'm sorry , I skipped it . Anyways , that's Yeah , this is it . Do you have anything you you came up with yet ? About uh marketing transfer , whatever ?
D :  Um about what ? Marketing ?
A :  Marketing I'm not sure what you what you came up with yet . You have anything to share ? Or else we'll cut the meeting just cut the meeting short since we're supposed to stop .
D :  Um no , not really yet , but I've some ideas and I will uh
A :  Okay .
A :  Anyways , the the personal coach will give you the your p your personal assignments and everything . So we'll just meet back in here thirty minutes . I'm sure we have that .
D :  say it uh
D :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  Good luck everyone .
A :  Yeah , thanks for attending . I'll see you back here in thirty minutes .
B :  Mm , good luck .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yes .
A :  Wait for the marketing director actually , so .
A :  Anyways .
A :  Uh .
A :  See , shall we wait ? I'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever , so I'm gonna start soon , we have now don't have much time anyway . There you are , okay .
B :  Oh , there he is .
D :  Yes . Sorry , a little bit of pl little problem with computer .
C :  Okay , we
A :  Uh no problem . We're about to start , so have a seat .
A :  Okay , welcome again . Today , functional design phase .
D :  .
A :  I'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting . Okay , that was just to get to know each other , have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project , so
D :  Uh .
A :  I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the the project share , so if you wanna review them , they're there . I will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there . Anyways , um today three presentations , from every one of you .
A :  Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board , so we're gonna go af go after over this later . But I wanna start with uh stuff you did first , so we can see what everybody came up with . And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , so . Who would like wanna go first ?
D :  Yeah , sure , no problem . Um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh
B :  Go ahead .
A :  Take it .
A :  Anyway , let's see what you have .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Um
D :  Okay , and
A :  Uh it's still a bit open .
D :  I want to open the my s oh no .
A :  You should close it on your own notebook , I guess . Yeah . So there ? Okay .
D :  Oh no , that's okay .
D :  Uh slide show .
D :  Yes . The functional requirements , it's uh uh very important for uh the user , he he wants to yeah . The the method we used uh it it's not m not a slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use uh , um we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men , and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what's uh important . Uh
A :  If I can cut in , is it people or men ? Is it people , okay . 'Cause I thought it was only men , so 'Kay .
D :  People , sorry . Both women and men , yeah . Okay . Uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . Um
B :  That's pretty shocking uh .
A :  So we have to s we have to do something about that .
D :  Yeah , and yeah , most th th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it , and um they use yeah , they use zap a lot , um uh fifty percent say they only
D :  So that's the most important things . Um oh yeah , not all of it is it on mine
A :  Okay .
D :  on my PowerPoint presentation , but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use . Uh less important is tel teletext ,
A :  Okay , just talk ahead .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  uh um they use it , but it's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh and but not important is the channel selection , the the hmm ? Oh , the the no no no no no , that's very important , but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings and uh
A :  Okay , that's okay .
A :  That's a little weird .
B :  Which channel selection ?
A :  Okay , we can we can hide those under a menu or something , okay .
B :  Oh , okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Um new preferences preferences . Uh um um beep to find your control , was that was in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things . And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it ?
A :  That's like a button on your T_V_ ?
C :  Mm .
A :  Remote , okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel . Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Is that manageable ? 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too .
A :  That sounds too It's possible , but uh I think it's expensive , but do continue .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . Um
D :  Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , so I can uh I dunno , so I can zap to my uh
D :  f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh so , the remote mu must see or um
D :  must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , so I can zap t to
A :  Okay , you don't set it yourself , it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . You want the you want it to be programmed , for example y programmed f or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? Let's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , so it recognises your favourite channel .
D :  What ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Recognise
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's uh what my personal preference like .
A :  Okay , so it's it it does it recognise itself , you don't have to set it Okay .
D :  No , itself . Maybe it's easier to to sell it , but
A :  Okay .
D :  I don't know it's manageable , but we will uh we will see . Yeah , it's a little bit uh it's the end of it . It's a little bit uh I lost it , the computer uh crashed , so .
A :  I see .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  No problem , it's it's okay , that's Yeah , go ahead .
B :  Shall I go ? Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So , some technical functions .
D :  Darn computer .
B :  Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . Uh let's just start with the method . It sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . We can do that . What goes wrong
B :  at the user . Gets the remote control . Where is the remote control ? We've all had it once , I want to watch some television , where's the remote control ? That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , a really good idea . Uh these are just the issues . I come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . Searches for the button .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That seems very good .
B :  There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . Uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear . Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while .
D :  Mm uh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you don't know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find uh something for that , yes . Uh covered that . Oh yes , user presses the button . Um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . So you press more once remote control goes
A :  Okay , so have it more make it more durable actually . Okay .
A :  Okay , so the buttons should be
B :  kablouey or something like that , so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger si
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
A :  Wow . The s Yeah . Make it make them bigger . Even more durable uh .
B :  So this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others . Uh
A :  Okay .
B :  This I pretty much covered . So what we want to go to is not this one , but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons .
A :  Yeah , it's true .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So that's basically uh what I had in mind .
A :  Yeah , that's clear .
B :  This is not the final design , this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea .
A :  No , of course uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  I must say that it
B :  So that was it .
A :  Hmm .
A :  That was it . Okay , that was good . So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing , so The other aspects , we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget .
B :  Yeah , I think it's a really good idea .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Okay , that's fine . Um . Okay , now work a little with me .
C :  Okay . Well , let's start it as it is . Okay , uh the method . There are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . Which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? I'll tell you why that's important to me . Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that's why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built . So it's that's not as easy as it s might look like . Uh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . I have to check out how far I can go with that . Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , I think we can just go on with that . Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Of course , hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . Okay .
C :  Exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . So we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again . This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , that's how you should see it . The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . You have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it ? Uh a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning .
A :  Yeah , okay . So you have
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . That was it ? I'll get back to my thing then .
C :  That was it .
A :  Uh
A :  Okay , back this up to the screen . So I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet , nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either
A :  Well , I don't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it . But I don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example . Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . It's not important anymore . Um we're targeting young people now , because our um
B :  Yeah .
A :  This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , which are um the younger people were defined under forty . I so I think it's that's also good with the fashion and everything , so yeah .
D :  Uh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , and they want to pay for it and uh
A :  They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . If they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it .
D :  With more
D :  Where with more technical specifications
A :  Yeah . see how far we can go with it anyway , so And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow , but
D :  in the
D :  Yeah .
A :  I'm not sure if we I think we should keep the the logo in mind , because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody's taste . So
A :  With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your I mean those cost hardly anything I think , and people could even spend extra money
B :  Oh .
C :  Yeah .
A :  on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . Or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design .
A :  And sell the covers separately , for example . That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . So you don't have to I think you don't have to make entire remote controls . We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately . So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . So just
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . Would you like to share ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  No , I think this is a good idea . But
A :  Okay .
D :  But oh ?
B :  Is it manageable ? Is it easy ?
C :  Go ahead .
D :  Yeah , with with an L_C_D_ screen you can
A :  Oh yeah . I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen , like you said . I think for example it's it's huge I think the L_C_D_ is huge , it consumes batteries like hell .
C :  Yes , I think so too .
D :  Why ? Nokia w
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh .
A :  I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . It costs a lot , I think . What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview , but y I'm not sure if it's even possible . For example , a little T_V_ guide .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And it costs too much to fabricate , so we're on a tight budget here .
C :  Okay , uh
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Like you have a little just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide . I'm not sure it's even possible , but maybe okay , make it Yeah , find a little compromise in that , but What did I write down ? I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your T_V_ and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . I think it's easy to implement , we should go for that . Uh speech recognition .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm . I have to check that out , I'm not sure .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That must be possible .
C :  Ja .
C :  I'm sorry , whe where do you wanna hit the T_ you wanna we want a button on the television . In th okay , but that rules out a universal remote control .
B :  And it's
A :  I thin Yeah , I mean where else should you put it ?
C :  Because that's not possible uh .
A :  Yeah , but how are you gonna use that if your I mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ?
C :  Uh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Exactly .
B :  Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal .
A :  A slap-on sticker . Oh , you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_ . Yeah , that could be possible . A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay .
D :  Mm uh .
B :  Yeah , exactly .
C :  Okay , then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do . If not Okay .
A :  I think it's universal .
A :  I think we should go for universal , because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . I think universal remote control should be possible .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Um
C :  Okay , then I go for that .
D :  Everyone uh wants to buy it , so we w yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think we're targeting everyone , so remote
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . No , it's fine with me , but then I know what to look for .
A :  Okay , universal is good . Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries . So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it's very hard to do .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Or one .
B :  And it's
D :  Or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough , right ? But
A :  Yeah , but I don't see Arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever .
D :  Oh yeah .
B :  Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , so that is a problem in implementing this .
A :  It's Yeah . It's not a mature technology , I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control , so
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  It's a good idea , but it's just not I don't think the market's ripe for that yet .
A :  I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . What else do we have ? Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable .
C :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So the the the symbols won't fade , maybe a little harder plastic or especially li we don't maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons , so those always fade first .
C :  Exactly . I already noted that .
C :  Mm , okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . Let's see .
C :  Hmm .
C :  If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . That's fo is uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language .
A :  For example ?
A :  Well , we're not we're not targeting older people , we should remember that . Everything we target is under forty , so . You assume that that they read correctly and I think they're The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world , so
D :  Yeah .
C :  That's okay , okay .
C :  Huh .
D :  But b
C :  Uh okay .
B :  But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the
A :  No , of course . No , I think it's just something you you put over them , because Yeah we c Yeah , you ca Well , tha that's not a that's not a bad that's not even it's not even a bad idea . I mean , for example , if you're if you're into the durability issue
C :  Hmm .
D :  But every
B :  C that's a problem with the with the text then .
C :  Hmm .
A :  you could For example , if your buttons are faded , after I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make . So it's a good and a bad idea .
C :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Uh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve , so you don't have to change your whole cover . Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . Know what I mean ? It works the same as a Nokia telephone , it's it's in my uh 'kay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh .
B :  Oh yeah , I know what you mean .
A :  Yeah , I know , it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example , okay . Yeah , that's what I something I have to look into . Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , I'm not sure which which is easier , so
D :  Yeah .
C :  Exactly .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Um anyway , yeah , this is what we're gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let's see what we let's see we
A :  So you have to come up with a components concept , yeah . I want some you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase , because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um
A :  Yeah , I think user interface is fairly obvious . I mean it should be very intuitive , s Yeah , it should speak for itself . Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ , it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , and I'm total T_V_ new , anyway .
B :  Pretty straightforward .
A :  So I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ .
C :  Mm .
B :  Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , because we're working with different types of television , so we're going to work with that ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  That is true .
C :  I don't think so .
A :  No , that's true .
C :  No , I don't think so . Because the television needs to respond to the signal , and if it doesn't know how , it's Exactly , that's not possible .
A :  Yeah , that's true .
B :  It's an in-built menu , isn't it ? Yes .
B :  So basically we
A :  I'm not sure if it's impossible , but uh there's a chance it's not , so .
B :  Or we could use a double-sided for less used functions you
A :  A double-sided remote control ? I don't think that's useful .
B :  Yeah , with the cover . I it's basically an idea to overcome these issues , because
A :  Yeah , but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons . For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a Sony that won't for a Philips T_V_ .
C :  Hmm .
B :  No , but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used . Because if we use a universal remote control , we're going to have to have most buttons on it , so
D :  Yeah .
A :  I don't think we should Yeah , for exam
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  I'm not s yeah , for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s , not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , but
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
C :  But that might be broken .
A :  you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Especially the big ones , the big brands , so . 'Cause everybody I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so I think I'm not sure , if you can put some research into that , if it's possible . Uh I think just a b and the navigation is very basic , it's usually the same thing .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Mm okay .
C :  Mm . But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it . Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's true . I think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , I think it's possible , just the way how to . Yeah , then then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's okay .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , I thi I think so too .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . We should not do that .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else , because it's either it's both mayb maybe the shape can be a little different . Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever .
C :  Exactly .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I have some ideas .
B :  I have some ideas .
D :  Um yeah .
C :  Mm that's your uh division .
D :  And uh with different colours uh .
A :  So um
B :  I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have .
A :  Yeah , this . Not sure what because we have forty minutes , I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so .
D :  Okay .
B :  I heard a beep go .
A :  Yeah , but it wasn't me , it was him closing something . So anyway , yeah , we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . I mean what do you want , do you want , but
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but we like some some curves or
A :  Yeah , may maybe something like this .
A :  But though smooth inside .
A :  So you have the transmitter here for example . Let's see that you what would be handy . I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own . Let's see one , two God damn it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh .
D :  And a light uh
B :  Oh , we get the general ideas , yes .
A :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Another one here . Let's see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah , and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume yeah yeah .
A :  Think it's like this .
D :  Volume .
A :  Withi within the Yeah , just take it .
B :  So you have the up channel
B :  the down channel the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ?
A :  Do you take triangles or
D :  Uh it's it's fine , I think .
A :  Um I think it should be I think it Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . Yeah .
B :  This is basically what people are accustomed to , so
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but this is just a g general idea . Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle .
D :  Oh d
A :  Yeah , in the middle . It's it's usually uh there , but
B :  Whoa .
A :  Mm .
C :  Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf . They they won't hear the the beep .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash .
B :  You won't be able to find it .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And flash takes up a lot of batteries again .
C :  Uh .
C :  Yeah , it's true , but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost .
D :  Just
A :  Yeah .
B :  We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up .
C :  So .
D :  And L_E_D_ uh on it .
C :  deaf people ?
A :  Yeah , I thought about for deaf people for example , so . We could do that . Uh let's see .
D :  Just a light on it or
B :  So we have the basic channels we've got here , uh the power button
A :  Oh yeah , it's true .
B :  somewhere over here ?
A :  Um that thing should be central . You shouldn't be you uh shouldn't press it by accident , but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere .
D :  Very important .
D :  Oh , that's
B :  I usually
D :  It's
B :  press it on top . At least that's what I'm accustomed to .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I have another idea , I'm not sure if it's possible .
A :  Yeah , like that's gonna work .
D :  And
B :  What would you like to ?
A :  Yeah , I thought maybe we should move the buttons down and put it here for example to
D :  But you r
D :  And you are reading from the t you always read from the top to the the bottom of it . Yeah , so it's
A :  From top to bottom . Yeah , that's true , you should I think the bu the power button should be on top , 'cause it's the first thing you do , turn it on . So power button on top . Um
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , mute button . Is that somewhere here ? Is that used often ? The mute button ? Do people use that often ? 'Cause uh I'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here , at least in general , but
A :  Mute . Do we hardly I think it should be at the bottom somewhere .
D :  So i it's sorry ?
A :  Mute . Turn the sound off .
D :  No , it's no .
D :  Uh .
D :  Hmm .
A :  I don't think it's important , but I think it I think it should be you c you could put it somewhere here .
B :  It's not that important , no .
D :  Or or with the volume selection .
A :  No , because it Yeah , people are accustomed to that , it's
D :  Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection . I don't know where exactly , but
A :  Can I have that ? That's j
B :  Sure .
A :  Take this out and here see
A :  Uh are we gonna take triangles anyway ? I'm drawing triangles , but
B :  That's pretty much what people are accustomed to , aren't they ?
A :  Yeah , it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . So anyway , I think this is should be
A :  the channels and or sh
B :  Well , I'm accustomed to the channels being on top .
D :  No . Yeah .
A :  Here , okay . Okay , should we chan okay , this two , channel
C :  Yeah , me too .
D :  Yeah , that's better . On the right .
A :  up and down .
C :  Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? That you don't have to buy new batteries if every
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , for that is it's on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it
D :  Maybe it's more ex expensive .
C :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . You have just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it's an it's it's it's very annoying .
C :  Uh .
C :  But that's already possible .
B :  But isn't that expensive in the entire package ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . Because if it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes .
C :  Okay . Uh you could make a device , but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , but it you're the remote also can act as a recharger . So then you can choose , you have every decision . Know what I mean ?
A :  How about
A :  I think I have a nice idea .
A :  Not exactly uh .
C :  You can uh put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah yeah .
A :  I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it .
C :  So but
D :  Yeah , that's g
C :  But I think that will cost a lot . Uh a normal wire would be better . Like a like a P_D_A_ , a hand-held . You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , you don't need basic station .
A :  I'm not sure . A what ?
A :  Well , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal or So you could put that on a T_V_ for example . It could be very flat , could be very small . It's a very small Yeah , I'm drawing it big now , but So you can put your remote on flat for example .
C :  Yes .
C :  That is possible , that's true .
D :  But
D :  Which
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole
C :  Yeah .
A :  for example um you just put it down , it recharges for example . I don't think it's very expensive .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But again , isn't that too expensive ? 'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station
D :  Yeah .
A :  I'm not sure if it costs a lot , that that's what he r
C :  Mm .
A :  That's that you that's what you buy yourself .
C :  Yes . I'm going to try to find that out . I'm not sure if there's information available on this , but
A :  It's just an idea , we have to find out if it's possible .
D :  But
B :  And do people actually want that ? To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ?
D :  Yeah , they want to pay for it .
A :  Do they want but they want a rechargeable one ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  I'm not sure , you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important .
D :  Th uh there was not a el ask esque
C :  Hmm . These are uh comfort issues . So I think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort . Well , this is comfort .
A :  Yeah .
D :  But
A :  They want to pay for comfort , we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , um and
D :  But f hmm .
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah . Exactly . I think this is a brilliant product . I would buy it myself .
A :  I think it would be good actually . I like the beep part anyway . So um let's go through the
C :  Uh .
C :  I like the covers . That's a brilliant idea . I never thought
B :  Can can we save this or
A :  Covers is covers is good . Yeah , it's Oh we can save this . Up and saved . We even saved the ant .
A :  Um
A :  Okay .
A :  So what we have is you have I think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost .
C :  I hope if I have information about that , I'm gonna
A :  Maybe yeah , or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . We are going for twenty five Euros sales price , but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , uh we just have to see what it looks like .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah .
C :  Mm . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I would like to make a decision . What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it and exactly , I need it .
A :  Yeah , if you have some financial information that that'd be nice , so . Hmm .
B :  Could you post some other essentials of what people want , so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it
A : 
D :  Yeah .
B :  You seem to have information on that , I'd like to uh
B :  see some of it .
C :  Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ?
A :  No , it wasn't wasn't allo it was possible , not allowed , so .
B :  No , it's not . No .
C :  Not .
A :  So that's um why I'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft .
D :  Yeah .
D :  My computer crashed , so uh
C :  Yeah , okay .
A :  I don't care . I haven't heard any complaints yet , so . Um
D :  I lost my uh presentation , but
B :  Oh , your computer . Okay .
D :  I have the uh
B :  Well , I have your PowerPoint presentation , I can get some inf information out of that .
D :  Yeah , but I
D :  Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our
B :  Let's see .
A :  Yeah , the oh , they inc uh they include the new one . Or just for you .
D :  internet , and here is my
B :  Oh , where would we
D :  here is my marketing report , maybe you ca you can look at uh that and
A :  Oh no , I didn't have that .
B :  Where would we want the uh teletext button ? Because we decided that it's n not that important . Do we put it somewhere over here ?
D :  Ah yeah . And one
A :  All it tells just let's make make a new tick the new one .
A :  Um other side . Yeah , let's increase it a little because
D :  And uh wha what people want ,
B :  Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , I can draw out some ideas .
D :  I've uh
A :  Yeah , draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , so the more less important
D :  I have another thing uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well , we have decided more or less the basic structure . I can put the other buttons in
A :  More or less .
A :  Just play a little with this , put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best .
B :  Yeah .
C :  What uh what did you wanna say ?
A :  Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share .
D :  Yeah . Um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh what I al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost , but it it's also for people , they want to learn it fast , not uh they want to
B :  Maybe another idea uh .
C :  Mm . Mm .
A :  Yeah , so we don't want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot .
C :  Mm .
D :  It's yeah , it's easy to learn wi and uh
B :  Yes , but it should cover all the functions , so possibly , just an idea that popped in
A :  Well what we had function that what people do , so . People change channels , people they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn T_V_ off and on , for example . That's the basic fu that's what you do I'm not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented .
D :  Um
B :  Yeah , but we could go a step further , because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus .
D :  And
D :  The
D :  If
A :  That's true , but that's what we stick under the menu button . Everything is you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu .
B :  Yes , but it
C :  But that's the question , is it ? Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . If it isn't , then we cannot reach it .
B :  Because we're making
D :  Um
A :  Yeah , but
B :  We need to adjust to the technology .
A :  But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu .
C :  I think so too . I think so too . Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ?
B :  True .
C :  If you rule out functions , then uh and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it . That's a bad bad com commercial for okay .
B :  No , I thi
D :  If um
A :  Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with .
D :  Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty . Um on my report , I didn't uh ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation , because my computer crashed . Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition .
A :  Under forty . Yeah ?
C :  That's true .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah yeah .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  The want to pay for Oh .
C :  Did they really said it like that ? Those two things . Do they realise how much that costs ? That's almost undoable .
D :  i yeah . Yeah , and
A :  Uh shall we ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Younger , age sixteen and forty five .
D :  Uh but
A :  That's all here , here it says
C :  No , that's that's . Even if i if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price .
A :  Yeah , age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . Okay , so we're not focusing on this .
D :  If if they
A :  Um
A :  All the interest in features , not really the L_C_ oh here . Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . Hmm , okay ?
C :  Yeah , that's true .
D :  So uh
D :  we can
A :  Speech recognition is quite
D :  We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ and uh I dunno . Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , because if apparently it's what people want , it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , maybe it's not even that expensive . Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes .
C :  Hmm .
D :  How much it will cost and
C :  Uh .
C :  Uh I
D :  Um
B :  Well I doubt it , but
C :  But I really need finance information .
A :  Me too . I mean we all do . Right . I think it's something we should put into consideration . Apparently it's what people want , so . We should see if what it costs , if it's possible .
D :  It will come uh
C :  We all do .
C :  Mm .
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it , it looks still looks boring , so .
D :  Different colours maybe .
C :  Hmm . And the design , it should differ . This is Philips , huh ? Philips has this .
D :  But all
A :  I have no clue . I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily .
B :  Well , I had basically
C :  Okay .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Uh .
B :  Something like this . To make it kind of futuristic .
C :  Mm . Oh , I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , because I need to put all the electronics in it . If we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , because I have to put all the electronics in it .
A :  I think it's a very
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah , but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy . I mean we can stick it in in there , I think . Huh even if in the worst case we can even Could you give me the pen back ?
D :  Okay .
C :  No .
B :  So what kind of
B :  Yeah , sure .
A :  So let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . Let's take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap uh came up with . I'll just make it a little bigger now .
A :  So a transmitter here . Anyway .
A :  We could let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , people want an L_C_D_ screen . So then we should probably put it here .
A :  It doesn't have to be really big , but just just have to be has to be there . Think it's a good place , people don't
C :  Hmm .
D :  If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top . It's j
A :  No ? It's not that uh it's not the most important function , it's just an extra thing , it just you press the buttons on top , because your finger is on top .
C :  Me too .
C :  Ah but .
D :  Uh . But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it , I think it's very important to use it , uh because it's use it uh
A :  How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ?
D :  But nee the function of it . So you can use it maximum , because uh it's a lot it costs a lot .
D :  So
A :  Yeah , but why I I'm not sure .
B :  Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand .
A :  Uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , ri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like .
C :  Hmm .
C :  No . M I personally would prefer it on the top .
B :  I'm
A :  You would prefer it n Okay . So we have three people saying it should be on top .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Huh .
C :  But it
A :  Okay , but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . Anyways .
C :  Hmm .
D :  It's expensive to build it , so
C :  Mm .
A :  Uh this looks a little
D :  you must use the maximum of it .
B :  I'm still not convinced of the
A :  About the L_C_D_s thing . Well if it if it's if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it , because it's it's cool .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
C :  They want it uh .
C :  We should just try to make that if it's possible . If it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information .
D :  Huh .
D :  Uh . But uh
C :  Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space .
C :  So I have to look if that's possible .
D :  Yeah , I know uh .
C :  But if we
B :  So basically can I what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle ?
A :  Uh we have green now uh
D :  In middle of it .
A :  Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom . Maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example . I think this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons for example .
D :  In the middle .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , because it's basically the most important function .
A :  For up and down , ma make it a circle on it , because it
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think the channel button should be in the centre . Channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . Because it's uh
D :  It's the most import yeah .
B :  Well , that would make them quite small . So maybe you'd put them here .
A :  We're not sure about the size anyway , just a general design . You can make it as big as you want . For example if you take uh
B :  Yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like .
C :  Hmm .
A :  No , let's see . For example just
C :  If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . It is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . That might be an option .
A :  Yeah . I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely .
D :  .
C :  Yeah , but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . But it has to be a little bit heavier .
A :  Yeah , but we have to see what the si what the size is . The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big .
C :  Okay .
D : 
C :  No , but the things behind it . space .
A :  Mm let's see .
C :  Like a process uh .
D :  Finish meeting now . It's on your computer .
A :  Finish meeting now . Okay , we will . So either
B :  So would we like this or would we like the
A :  We either we have to decide what what people want . Either this one , this this could be the luxurious one .
C :  I like this one more .
A :  So we have channel buttons here . I'm just drawing something uh . Uh
A :  I think this would this would look cool . You could have it for example
A :  small buttons here for some extra functions , so if your basic function's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down ,
D :  Uh .
C :  Mm .
A :  and volume here .
D :  Or
B :  Let's see what we have here .
D :  And uh what about speech recognition uh
A :  Well you can just no , I'm not sure if we can do that , but we could put a microphone in here for example .
D :  Yeah , yeah , but or or an L_C_D_ or an uh speech . I think it's L_C_D_ is better now .
C :  Mm .
A :  Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . But let's cut the meeting for now yes .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I'll try to .
D :  Yeah .
C :  One more uh thing I'd like to say , uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . Shall we all try uh to think about a name ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , okay , yeah , that's yeah , that's okay .
B :  So I think of a name .
A :  Yeah , let's think of a name , okay .
A :  Uh okay .
D :  Oh , good .
A :  Okay , at anyways , the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , so there we go uh .
B :  So
B :  Yes , go and finish up and I'll see you at lunch .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Good luck .
A :  Yeah , to all .
D :  Same .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I've Do we uh save the ?
D :  .
D :  .
C :  Did you manage ?
D :  Yeah , sh not quite .
C :  Okay .
D :  You will see uh
C :  Ah . Hello .
A :  Hello . So , are you d what were j you guys discussing ?
C :  No , just uh ask if if he could manage .
D : 
D :  Woah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Did you find anything new ?
D :  Mm uh nothing special . Uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I have a lot of new information .
D :  Yeah , the for uh the trendy uh stuff .
A :  Great , great .
D :  A little bit . I uh now will show it .
A :  Come on .
A :  .
C :  Hey , everything alright . Did you manage ?
B :  Well , I had just a little bit of time , so I hope it's something uh we can work with . But
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  What's uh here .
D :  Yeah , I had the same . It just uh
C :  Do you have a lot of new information ? Do you have a lot of new information ?
D :  shuts itself down and
B :  Hmm ?
B :  Well , I heard that there was a new uh component speech recognition component , which was pretty much up to standard , so we might use that I put that in my drawing , but again I didn't not have that much time . So
D :  Oh .
C :  That's true .
A :  And there we are .
C :  Huh .
C :  Alright . I have a lot of new information . I have a complete list of uh everything that we can use , all the components that all av available . I have no I still don't have any finance information , but at least we have a lot more to go on now
A :  What the f oh , yeah uh .
A :  It doesn't do what I want it
B :  Okay , that's just super . Let me just
D :  .
B :  uh
A :  Okay fine , that's too bad . Yeah , I have to start our
B :  You need to start it up first ? Okay .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Okay , go again . Well second phase , conceptual design . It's fine , everybody knows what we're talking about . So , take you past the minutes of last meeting again . Again you get your three presentate to see what you came up with . So too bad we don't have any finance information apparently . So that's too bad . So then we'll just have to d uh have to go on , you know , the information that we have to make the make final decisions on uh on a conceptual design . So
D :  Yep .
A :  Here we go . Anyway , last w last w what discussed last time , you all remember that , that we have to keep the electronics size in mind . Same goes for you . We have to have an easy design with big buttons which are durable and there are people actually spen willing to spend money to do to get more features and uh among those features L_C_D_ screen and voice recognition are very popular . So we have to make a move on that area , I guess . S especially s when when the new uh component is applicable in our uh product , we'll be fine .
A :  Anyways , well teletext wasn't important and that's what I took . And the consumer , yeah , we aim for young consumers , so that's fine . And well actually we yeah , we did need some more data on finances , but w yeah we still don't have that apparently . That's too bad . Yeah , we need to im de we are going to implement the beep and the flash thing to recover your remote . So one of these interchangeable covers apparently which will make it a more fashionable product . So anyway .
D :  Mm uh-huh .
A :  Guess we'll have to do this after the after the you give your presentations . So I'll just close this one now , and let's uh let's see , . We have a lot to tell . You had a lot to go on . So uh how about you go first .
B :  Okay , what t
D :  I bet
C :  Yep , that's right .
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  Oh okay .
C :  Let's see where my
C :  presentation is .
C :  Okay , um this I mentioned before . Every feature for our remote control needs to have their own operating electronic devices . We need to take care of that . Then warning , uh there has to be a chip in our remote control . And the chip requirements uh needed for a normal button uh is just a simple chip , uh scroll-wheel , and L_C_D_ is an advanced . Of course this is more expensive than this . So we have to decide on that in a minute . The available uh components for energy are , we have a basic battery , a hand an uh dynamo , like in uh old torches . We have a kin uh kinetic provision , then you have to shake the remote control to get the energy . And we have solar cells . I suggest that we uh decide on that one uh immediately . Then I have all lists . So
A :  Okay .
C :  My personal uh fav favourite is the kinetic provision because uh I ha
D :  Um
A :  Does it provide enough energy ?
C :  I think so , yes .
A :  Also if if we were choose the the L_C_D_ option , would it give enough energy Okay , that's the just assume it takes .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes . Because I had the information uh you take uh the remote control , you pick it up at least two times a day . So then it's already shaken and gives energy .
A :  Well , I'm not sure if it's shaken enough , because
B :  Is that enough ? Because I don't really see people shaking their remote control before using it .
C :  .
C :  Or
A :  No , I don't think so , because uh watches can go on kinetic energy because they move all the time . But I'm sure t I mean remotes lie still I think like ninety nine percent of the time . So I don't think that's a really good the other alternative were solar cells . I don't think that's applicable because
C :  Think
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Other options are solar cells , hand dynamo and basic battery .
B :  No .
A :  I thin why why shouldn't we take a basic battery ?
B :  And what does the hand dynamo oh , sorry .
D :  Yeah . A rechargeable maybe .
C :  Only basic battery ? Okay , but I think this is not a r
A :  Why not ? I mean everybody everybody knows how to use that . It's it's common . So and it's available everywhere . So why sh mm I think better .
D :  Re rechargeable basi
C :  .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , but I think this rules out our unit our rechargeable unit . This is really a really basic battery , a normal battery .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but it's
A :  Yeah , uh it wasn't it wasn't in the options , a rechargeable m module actually .
B :  Oh .
C :  Huh ?
C :  Okay , that's uh . Okay ?
A :  Okay yeah , b you c of course you could place re re-chargeable batteries . But that's up to the consumer himself . So
D :  Yep . Basic .
C :  Okay , but then we don't offer a re-chargement function . That's what it says .
A :  Well , mm it's not in the list . So we cannot choose from it . So
C :  Exactly . Alright . Right . Yep . Next one is curving . Uh we can make a model that has one curve , two or three .
A :  Okay , will just take regular batteries .
D :  Okay .
C :  And uh uh th uh the shape . Of course uh the more curves the more expensive . Exactly . Yes .
B :  Curves being ?
D :  Okay .
B :  Of the remote control itself , okay . I was thinking along the line of one curve . I'll show that in my design .
D :  But
D :  But
D :  It dep
D :  But
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay , we'll get back on that later . Just
B :  So we'll get back to that .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm . I think one curve is uh fine .
D :  Yeah .
A :  But what were the implications if you if put more curves it it's gets more expensive . Okay , so I think with with the extras that we had there it's two curves I suppose . Okay .
D :  Depends on the user .
C :  More expensive . More difficult to make .
C :  Exactly . And I believe even that the r the number of options we have on putting things in it uh goes down with exactly . Material . I have to offer a plastic , rubber , wood or titanium . Uh if we choose plastic , we cannot choose solar cells for energy . If we choose titanium , uh we cannot use more than one curve .
A :  Also decreases , okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  But we don't have that so fast .
A :  More than one curve , uh yeah okay . We'll just go uh
B :  Okay , I t I'd go for plastic because I have a couple of curves in my design . Well , g let's just get back to that .
A :  'Cause it yeah , I'm not sure .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  We'll discuss that later . Okay , we have so I think we can rule out um I'm not sure we can rule anything out . We'll do that when y when you get your design .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  No .
C :  But I think wood is not an option either .
B :  No , wood's not an option . No .
A :  No , wood i wood's not an option . Well it it's stylish , but we can yeah , but you can change your covers anyway .
C :  Okay .
C :  Hmm .
D :  No .
C :  Okay . My personal thought was uh rubber because I had an email , I believe it was from you , uh f against falling .
A :  Yeah , is it keep in mind that it it's it's uh it fal uh remote controls fall a lot on the ground . So you don't want it to break . So either have rubber edges or a rubber remote control is very durable . But Continue .
D : 
C :  Hmm .
C :  Okay . Uh
B :  Yeah , but it doesn't have to be unbreakable , because we do need to keep selling these thing
D :  No .
A :  Don't have to be un-breakable , it's p it's a it's not supposed to ju yeah , break after one use . I mean it they they fall a lot . So
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay , well that that's definitely true .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm . I think we have to decide on this anyway . Uh because if we make removeable covers , it has to be one of those mat materials . We have no more than this . So
B :  Because it well , ru will rubber actually protect the remote control itself ? Because it
D : 
A :  Well , you have for if you if for example if you take hard plastic . If it falls it might crack . And rubber uh kind of softens the fall .
B :  Yeah , but then you buy a new cover . But rubber
A :  I'm not sure if it's the it's the entire cover you change . Uh , it's could be .
D :  Are are we focussi focussing on on the
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  You know what , th we're focusing very much on the covers now . I think it's just w now we're going for the basic design . If we wanna expand our options , f be fashionable , then we can get changeable covers . But I think the basic thing let's just rule out wood for now and continue .
D :  But
D :  But
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
D :  Not that but are we focussing on the uh younger people or the elder people ? Younger , okay . Yeah , that's okay . Nah , that's
A :  We're definitely focussing on the younger people , 'cause that was our main goal .
C :  Alright . Then I proceed , but I need to know after this meeting . So Interface , uh I have four things to offer , pu uh normal push-buttons of course . Um uh we have a lot of expertise on that one . We have a large history , our company , on push-buttons . Scroll-wheels , uh those can be pushed as well , although that is more expensive . Um liquid crystal colour display and um
A :  Okay okay , we will .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  What is this ? Okay , and if we use rubber , I already mentioned that , we can only use rubber buttons . So rubber can only match with rubber . Which one of those are we gonna use ? Push-buttons , that's b uh I think basic .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Evident . Yeah , o of course we're gonna use . But I didn't I didn't go on the thought of a scroll-wheel actually . I'm still deciding on what what what could you use it for . Maybe for volume control . Channel , I think that would be annoying because it might accidentally scroll onto another channel . I think a push-button for channel would be better . I mean it for volume control it's it's a smoother motion , you can just increase or decrease . But not sure . For channels will be good .
B :  Yeah , of cour
C :  Huh .
D :  But
C :  No .
C :  I think the channels .
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  .
C :  Huh ?
C :  Huh .
C :  Hmm . But
B :  Yeah , but there is a is it really necessary 'cause a normal push-button can do that job .
A :  I don't think so . I haven't I haven't taken it into consideration .
C :  Huh ? Oh . Ah so but it looks cool . Mm no .
D :  But th the younger people my investigation turns out that the younger people want a little bit uh material that that is uh spongy and uh
A :  I don't think we really need one .
C :  Oh . Ah . flashy and yeah .
A :  .
C :  I think would be cool , scroll-wheel . It's not that much uh if we take a normal scroll-wheel without the pushing , then it's not expensive . We can do that .
D :  So
D :  A sc
A :  But why do we need it ?
B :  Yeah , but why would we use it ?
C :  Think .
C :  Ah we don't need it , but it's uh it's design a design thing .
D :  Yeah .
A :  If we don't need it , why put it in your why put it in your in your if it's if it's not something people are looking for or is useful .
D :  Yeah , you get
D :  No .
C :  I think they are looking for that . Of course we have uh a young target group . So they might find that attractive in a remote con
A :  Are they ?
D :  Scroll-wheel ? Uh I don't know .
A :  Yeah , but if it's if it's not useful , I don't think it I don't think it gives an extra function to the remote . Anyway
D :  Yeah , that's it .
C :  Okay . So push-buttons we will use . Uh L_C_D_ screen ?
B :  Perhaps . I have t I have two different
C :  Is that s
A :  What you what what'd you get on the L_C_D_ screen ? Is it expensive ? Does it
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh I only know that if we are using that , we need ano uh an advanced chip in it . And that is more expensive .
A :  And how much more expensive is that ? Or
C :  I have no idea . I have no absolute numbers . I only have
A :  No absolute numbers , but it's just more expensive and takes more room I suppose in your in your design .
B :  Okay .
D :  .
C :  Yeah , but I don't think room is really an issue .
A :  Don't think it's an issue , okay . Oh let's go for let's say because it is uh very hot in n our target group I think , we should take it take it t to consideration to build an L_C_D_ screen in it .
D :  .
B :  I have two designs , one including uh an L_C_D_ screen , wh which is basically the deluxe edition . And then I also have a standard edition , which wi we can also choose to develop too .
D :  For the future .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Which basically has the same functionality , but lacks the L_C_D_ screen . Okay . We'll pick a we'll pick from uh we'll just combine everything later .
B :  Exactly .
B :  But we'll
C :  Mm-hmm . Okay . Electronics , uh the first one is the chip . Uh that's no longer an option , it has to be an advanced one now . 'Cause we have the L_C_D_ screen . Then we have an infrared sender , I think that's basic , we cannot do without . Otherwise it's not s a remote control . And we have the sample sensor and speaker , the voice recognition thing . Are we gonna do that or not ?
B :  Yep .
B :  Basically , it
D :  Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Once again I was would ask you if it's expensive , but apparently you don't have any data . So
B :  Oh , I got
C :  I only have uh uh relative information .
A :  Well what d what was exact what you got on the on the new component ?
B :  I got an email that it's relatively small .
A :  That's small . So we can implement it . So why why if it's small and we can imp why shouldn't we ?
B :  Yes , let me just
B :  Get back .
C :  Oh how did you
A :  And there's um get your mar marketing report ? What was uh the last number of how many people were interested in voice recognition ?
C :  That goes also for the scroll-wheel , by the way .
D :  Um uh
A :  Although it's hard for different countries of course .
D :  The most of them um
A :  But you have to programme it yourself , I suppose , with your own voice .
D :  Um uh more than uh sixty percent .
A :  More than sixty percent of the people would like voice recognition .
D :  Yeah . Mean of uh seventy percent I think . Uh I'm I have to look it up .
C :  Hmm .
A :  If it's small , if it's fits , if if people like it , why not ? So
C :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm . But don't we have any w uh information about scroll-wheel ? Scroll-wheel . If people would like that . That's strange , because that's the same story . It's it's not necessary like an L_C_D_ , but it's just it adds something to the design .
D :  No .
D :  No , only
D :  Ah . I don't know .
A :  Yeah , but we got some data on people that actually are int are interested in that , and I don't think a scroll-wheel offers new functionality , whereas speech recognition and L_C_D_ screen do offer new functionality in your product .
C :  Hmm .
D :  On the most spee
C :  No .
D :  But
C :  Oh that's r
D : 
C :  But I think uh we now already have to uh implement uh an advanced chip . So it's m
A :  Uh I think so , because if I think we're specially w if you're going maybe uh if you have the two editions you wanna wanna give out , probably you have one with uh with speech recognition and
D :  Yeah , for the future .
B :  Well , they b they basically can have speech recognition . I mainly focused on the L_C_D_ uh aspect .
A :  Um
A :  Yeah , hold on a minute . Were were you we're finished ? Or
C :  No , but that's that's okay .
A :  Oh .
A :  Because if there's something that
C : 
B :  'Cause you wanted to see them , right ?
C :  There is still time .
A :  'Cause have did you have all the materials ? Or everything that you desc
C :  Yes , this was uh the last M_S_ . I have a clear picture .
A :  Okay , so uh just just go for design for now . Just m have a seat for a second . Uh
A :  We'll combine everything after this .
B :  So this is basically the deluxe edition .
A :  Why is it s why is it squared ?
B :  I j
B :  Why is it square ?
A :  Why did you pick square ? Or uh not square , but why is it yeah , sharp corners .
B :  It 'cause it's designy .
B :  It's basically it has some futuristic
B :  Potentially , yeah . I don't really know . But I just thought that uh in normal remote controls you have like smooth curves and this and that , and this is something new , this is something different , something fresh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  People
A :  Looks like a Star Trek phaser .
A :  It's true .
B :  And basically what you can see here is that it has a little , yeah , let's say gap which you can put your finger in .
A :  Yeah . Or Okay , so just yeah , you can rest it on your finger . Okay .
D :  So only r right-handed .
B :  So you can you can hold it really comfortable , that's basically the idea .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But it but it's only right-handed then . Not for the left . Or
B :  Or left hand . I doesn't really matter .
A :  No , it just uh it's a curve inside a thing . So
C :  Hmm .
B :  As you can see , this is the remote control
D :  Where ?
A :  It's on the back .
D :  Oh in the back , okay . Oh yeah yeah .
B :  Uh you can't really see it that well , but this is the L_C_D_ screen . So just imagine it goes that way . Then you can see you can hold it in your left or in your right hand . And I also made a quick image , 'cause I did not have that much time ,
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , I think it's okay .
D :  Oh yeah yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah . I thought it
B :  of the standard edition
B :  which has basically the keys are pretty much the same .
A :  Keys are probably the n the number keys , I suppose .
B :  Yeah . I had to do this really fast . So excuse me for the uh inconvenience here , but as you can see , the keys moved .
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him . But
B :  Yeah .
B :  So these are basically the two types we have . So if we were to select the L_C_D_ screen , the transmitter here , you can see the light i
A :  Well , I think what you have to keep in mind is that um you're moving the the the number keys from the top . Uh in the the simple design you have them at a top , and the uh complex design you have them at the bottom . So it would that would give us a totally different design . So which actually making a whole different product instead of two different models . I think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products . So
B :  Well we can shift that . But normally , as you can see there , we put the uh number buttons right on top .
B :  Whereas because we had the L_C_D_ screen here , we had to move them downward , so what you could say is that
A :  Yeah , uh or for example , why did you pick the mm the numbers uh all the way below , and the and the channels and volume control
B :  Because these are basically the functions you use the most . So if you hold it in your hand like this , you put your finger in the gap , this is the m most easy part .
D :  Well it it's yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Bit .
C :  Hmm , I agree .
B :  For zapping , cau because people are zapping most of the time .
A :  That's fine . That's fine .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Just as long as you tak took it into consideration what people would prefer . Uh , okay if you all agree , I'm fine with it . But
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . So that's pretty much ha which I had in mind . As you can see here , this can be spaced for extra keys , which is the design thingys .
A :  Okay .
D :  No it maybe it's better to look uh what the people want . So I can uh show my uh investigation .
A :  Yeah , I think we'll
A :  I think we're going towards the deluxe edition anyway , because that seems to be what the people want . But let's see what's what they want now .
D :  Yeah , maybe it's better .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Especially for young people .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um where is that ? Where is th
A :  That's mine .
D :  Oh . Uh
A :  No , you should send it to the f to the folder first .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm I forgot that .
A :  Okay um , let's just assume we go to forty one .
D :  Okay , now it must be there .
D :  Yeah , here it is .
D :  Oh yeah .
D :  Okay , uh the investigation turns out that the most appear uh people want um um uh look and feel likes is uh uh the s the same as before , but it must be w a little bit fancier than uh the the look of it . Um the second important thing is um the it must be uh technol technological uh innova vative . So that's the L_C_D_ screen is perfect , I think , and not uh
B :  Speech recognition .
D :  Yeah , tha that's uh very important .
D :  And a third thing is
D :  um yeah , it's uh should be easy to use , so not not too much bu buttons and uh channel selection . I think that's uh what you showed is uh perfect .
D :  And what the pe young people want is uh in Paris and and in Milan uh it showed out that the fruit and vegetables are uh are trendy . Th they you s you see it in the clothes and everything . And um the contrast uh of it , it must uh the the buttons must a little bit spongy material . So uh rubber , I think uh th that's the best .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  No . Yeah , uh I agree .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Then rubber would be the best as a material indeed . If that is the uh
D :  No . So we are uh we were focussing uh on the younger people . So the elder , yeah , they wanted a little bit of wood in it and uh that's uh th that's not uh important now .
A :  I think so .
C :  Okay , agreement .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , so we're definitely going for rubber .
B :  It could be a c it could be a cover . But it's not . Our focus is the young audience . So let's stick to that .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but
A :  Let's just go
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  'Cause uh n I I I I thought uh it makes a young uh classic remote with uh
A :  Nah , I think we're in this case you're losing the the focus on the young group , because we're that's what we're focussing on . So I think the spongy feel gives us rubber .
D :  Yeah , that's why I I d uh
D :  decided
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  With a fruit uh
A :  Yeah , w th apparently
D :  cover ov or something like that . Uh
A :  Yeah , apparently yeah , maybe also yeah , I tend to disagree with with uh with a sharp form . I suppose it basi if you're uh saying fruits and vegetables , maybe it's supposed to be a little little more round .
D :  .
D :  Yeah , in in form of an uh vegetable or an uh fruit , maybe .
A :  Yeah , for exa maybe like uh like a pear or something .
B :  Yeah , but that's just more a se a seasonal , a trend thing . The idea now is is is that you can uh put a cover on it , for example , with fruit , like a shape or whatever . But not 'cause a n next year it will it'll be something completely different . And then you have your apple-shaped remote control , which is not trendy anymore . So I think that's more something you can focus
D :  And
D :  Oh , where is your
C :  That's true .
A :  That's what we're doing .
D :  A trendy
A :  Mm .
A :  I think shape is is important , because they s they really extend .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Here he here you can put a
C :  Hmm .
C :  Oh , that's true .
A :  Yeah , but now you have your your like your Star Trek phaser thing shaped control . So I I th the edges are really really sharp . I'm uh not su
B :  Well , you can s
D :  Uh maybe it
B :  What you can do is smooth the edges indeed . But that will bring extra c expenses .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Or maybe just make it make it up into into a low a smooth curve instead of just less sharp twist on the outside .
D :  But
D :  Yeah .
D :  All uh veg uh fruit and vegetables are round . So it's better
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think I think there needs to be a little I think it's too too sharp . The edges are too sharp . The bottom is fine of course if it's square . But maybe just th make uh the top a little round it off on the sides . So I mean y
D :  Yeah .
C :  But I think , according to my information , this would be two curves .
A :  That would be two curves .
D :  Two ?
C :  We have one left and one right , and that disables what was it again ?
D :  But it
C :  It's some it's something that we cannot do then .
A :  One cur you could also make the curve go through of course . But that would make make the top round .
B :  Well we've got we've got like one curve here .
C :  Okay , that's not a problem . That's only for the titanium . We don't have .
B :  For the gap .
D :  But it's that that's for the comfort . It's it's not for the trendy thing of it .
B :  And we could have one here .
B :  No , no no no no . What I'm just 'cause you mentioned that more curves the more expensive , so I'm just taking that into account .
D :  Yeah ? Okay , yeah .
C :  Yes .
A :  But let's see , titanium would give us only one curve . So but we're not d we're not using titanium .
D : 
C :  Then w yeah , but we don't have that . So we have
D :  So the no .
C :  We have no .
B :  Well we picked rubber , right ?
A :  Right , we did . So
C :  But they uh
D :  We m
B :  So basically what we can do is m make these edges a little bit less sharp . But the problem then is that it will start to resemble m the remote controls as we have them today . We were looking at something fresh , something trendy
A :  Just doodle something on the board on the left .
D :  form .
A :  Well actually , we're setting ourselves apart from by technology alone actually .
A :  So that let's see what you're doing .
C :  They th these wha are what they call the curves . This side , this side , this is how they count .
A :  Oh , okay . I don't think like that . Not not really the curves on the on the side of the remote .
B :  Okay .
C :  No no . This is what they uh what they mean . Okay , that's not really a good .
B :  Okay , so that's basically silly .
A :  Okay , now I uh of course now I understand why they have more uh like um
A :  Why the curves
A :  um decrease the the um the size the electronics that can be inside . So Okay .
A :  I don't think the outside would be called as a curve really .
D :  Yeah .
C :  It's like this .
A :  I think it's for all the basic well , looking from the side anyway . Well , if you see what I have to come up with some designs fast anyway . So
D :  But you can make uh if you want to use a fruit in uh in uh
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  But isn't the f the fruit like a cover thing , because we
D :  Uh
A :  Well , you shouldn't focus on the mostly on the covers , because lot of things we came up with , shouldn't be too really too much shouldn't be too focussed on the covers because it's kind of an idea of our own , but we're not sure if we can actually make that .
D :  Hey , you
D :  You can make it like
C :  Hmm .
B :  No , but
D :  Like this .
B :  But if we put that directly into the design , we limit ourselves extremely . Because it that's just for one seasonal trend .
A :  That's the one thing I'm also afraid of with this one because it the edges are really um they might stick out on the on the side for example . If you have a basic design , a little m a little smaller on the on the s on the edges , you could put more covers on it , y one one with square or um sharp corners if you want to . So M just round it off a little , I guess , because so we have more options I suppose .
D :  Well
D :  Oh .
D :  As a example . But
C :  Hmm .
D :  I d
B :  Okay , so that's well , that's probabl
C :  Hmm .
B :  , you'd just like it to go a little bit more like this .
A :  I think so because it looks leaner and we should just go with that . Anyway , you have all the time in the world to make to make the final design in a minute with him . So So we decided on what what did you guys wanna know again because this is um anyway , I'll fire up my thing . So so we come to a decision .
B :  Okay .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Did you present e everything you wanted to ?
C :  Yep . So I can uh qui oh . I can quickly make a conclusion
B :  Okay .
A :  Uh what the
C :  of what we have decided so far .
B :  Uh we still need to decide on a couple of things you you needed to know .
A :  Ah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , anyway . Uh energy , we choose regular regular batteries . The chip is advanced because we have the advanced features . The case , it will be the material will be rubber , suppose . Wouldn't the b the design we talked about . Uh user interface , type .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well I think we took all the components separately what we want . Um let's see um supplements . I'm not sure what they mean by that . Anyway , um apparently you guys , you should work together on the final design , both on internal and external design . So
A :  Yeah , you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market , how uh what's gonna happen with the final design as we have it now . So Yeah , of course you've got your specific instruction as usual . So Wanna spend some more um I think we're in a pretty much in agreement actually , which is good . So
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Are we all in agreement about the , well , the primary structure of the of my design ? Except for the edges . Like the keys there .
A :  Lef let's see , where the pen go ? Here .
A :  Yeah uh open your thing again . Let's see what if you can come up with anything new . Um I'll just do a next one .
A :  So what would give us your ne your design would be the lights would be on top , right ? Uh one on each one on each side .
B :  Yeah .
B :  To create a kind of disco effect when you
B :  That was basically what w
A :  Is it is it the lights for for finding the finding remote or lights that it that
B : 
B :  Light for the finding of the remote . We can also use one light for
B :  showing that the signal is being sent . But
A :  Yeah , I think that should just be a simple LED or something . Like that that's not that important of course . It just like a matter of a a beep if you pre that you just know that that there's context . So I don't think that's super important . But
A :  Hmm .
B :  So we have the teletext we have here , we have the mute .
A :  Uh sh Oh .
B :  L_C_D_ screen . This is the on off button .
D :  And speech w recognition . Are we
B :  Speech recognition , I where did I imagine . I did that pretty much over here , so that you could use it like this
D :  We
D :  Little uh voice uh
D :  Record and a uh no .
B :  and speak to it . Then you have the uh extra keys for teletext , mute , two buttons which can be pretty much anything or nothing . We can also just not use them .
A :  Let's see , I'll just make
B :  Main controls and a key-pad .
D :  Yeah .
A :  One light here .
A :  And just make it red now . But it could be any colour . So
B :  Will be fine .
A :  Okay , whatever . Fine , anyway . What do we have here ? M I'll make it um are we gonna use square buttons or round ones actually ?
A :  Personally I would prefer round ones .
C :  Me too .
B :  Yeah , but that would this was just in the design . Because if you I had a square design . So I had square buttons . But in that case the round buttons would be more appropriate .
D :  Form of fruit . It's better .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah , for
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , I assume it for so we take a r take a round power button right here .
A :  Whatever . Uh back to black .
A :  Uh not too big though .
A :  See this would be good .
A :  Um let's see .
A :  Are these for any extra controls ?
B :  Yeah . The left one is teletext and the right one is mute . And these two buttons are or not necessary or
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . If we go for for round buttons in general , do we want to the menu key in the middle to be round ? For example , if you let's see , put it this here . I think we'll go with the triangles that Come on .
B :  Yeah , the triangles would be best indeed .
A :  Triangles are good .
A :  Yeah , they're a little too big now . But
A :  Anyway , okay . So do you want for example a
A :  round button in the middle or square one ?
B :  I personally think that a round b button looks bit silly , but
C :  Hmm .
A :  I'm not sure uh , I just just came up with it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  This aligns nicely . So
A :  Okay . We'll just take the take the round button , suppose . Uh oh the square button , sorry .
B :  Does everybody agree on that ?
D :  Yep .
A :  I suppose so .
C :  I would prefer round . But doesn't matter , doesn't matter .
B :  You prefer a round ? Okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  That's not a big deal , think .
A :  So there's our numbers . Think we need an extra button here of course for yeah , like you had for the
A :  higher numbers .
A :  And you could include a button here for the mute , I suppose .
A :  For something else , just to
B :  Yeah , you can . But it but it's not necessary , becau
A :  mirror mirror the effect with this . That's not necessary because it you can take this away , but there it looks like there's a hole there , just to mirror the effect . Okay , so we have a few
B :  We could put our logo there .
A :  Nah , I think it it would be nice to put the logo here , for example , if you have some buttons here .
A :  We could put a logo here because it's very always in your field of vision . If you're watching it , the L_C_D_ screen , blah blah .
D :  And what about Oh .
D :  What about a button for your uh favourite channel ?
B :  Oh that could be that b
A :  Well we could we could include either here
D :  Uh yeah . With the extra controls . Uh
A :  or here , for example . But you think here or here ?
B :  Well now it's getting a little bit too crowded up there . So Is your
D :  Uh one one set
A :  I know .
D :  Yeah , you have to put it up uh
B :  So it can basically be the button down below or one of the four buttons up there . Because
A :  No , we could put this one as favourite channel for exam
D :  One of the four . Uh , it's better than , I think .
A :  What are these for ? Okay .
B :  One of the four is better , I suppose .
D :  It's a favourite channel .
A :  What ?
D :  What ? Nee , uh one of the four uh
B :  Because it's a little bit confusing to have twelve buttons down there , because you're only accustomed to eleven , I'd say .
D :  It's better th
A :  You're accustomed to eleven ?
A :  My uh okay , have it your way . I mean , think this looks rather like like there's something missing for example . I mean why wouldn't you include a 'cause there is a um a piece of electronics under there anyway . So why not give it a function . Let's say I mean could be anything . But th
B :  Oh , we still need an okay button .
C :  Hmm . Hmm .
B :  Well , you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned .
A :  No , I don't think because this is a zero . But you want zero to be mis-aligned with the rest . Anyway , so this is the basic design , we wanna have um on and off what are we missing ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  If it looks um
B :  Oh , we're pretty much missing an okay button , but we have a button up there which is still free . So
A :  Okay , so we want the remote to be the s the side view actually , what I'm gonna draw . So
A :  probably think you want the curve to be here . So have your finger under here like this , I suppose ? Okay .
B :  Yeah , pretty much .
A :  Just gonna be sh
D :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah . Want this straight or what ? Let's keep it at this .
A :  So it would be like this .
A :  Do we want something interesting with it or see .
A :  Would give us a light here . Maybe it's boring . You want it curved or what ? Maybe you want
B :  Well , I think it looks better curved . But that's probably uh
A :  Should like this ?
A :  Will give us design problem because we have
D :  Mm .
C :  Huh .
C :  It can be curved .
D :  Why ?
B :  It can be curved , because that yeah , it's a little bit more trendy to be curved .
C :  Yes .
A :  It can be curved . Okay ? I think so . That's why I asked you .
A :  Okay . So
C :  I would curve the whole actually .
B :  Hmm ?
C :  I would curve the whole . Like um like it hangs over your hand a little bit .
A :  Oh crap .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Then it will bounce and you don't drop it so easily .
A :  Yeah . Oh .
A :  Anyway , so you want to a little more like this ?
C :  Yeah , something like that , yes .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  And just s s
C :  Yes , exactly .
A :  Stop the curve here or continue it
C :  I think continue like that .
D :  Yep .
C :  Then there's also enough room for the electronics .
A :  So we have our L_C_D_ screen . Let's see .
A :  In
B :  But it pretty much looks like a banana already . Uh
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Let's make it yellow then . Uh
D :  Perfect .
A :  Bana it's banana vision .
B :  It's fruit . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , it's perfect .
A :  So you have your L_C_D_ screen right here , suppose .
A :  Um that would make
A :  We use the colours now . But
A :  Um
C :  Maybe once we can make a special edition in according with Chiquita .
C :  Have ourselves sponsored .
A :  You got sponsor , now you get a free one with every pack of Chiquita .
C :  Uh but it's a good trade-off for them if they can have their logo on it .
A :  So it would give the buttons here .
B :  Or they can design their own cover .
C :  Mm-hmm . They might wanna be the first ones to uh
B :  We could set up a a marketing uh agreement .
A :  I suppose I suppose we can put um let's see .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um
C :  Oh , perhaps they can use it .
C :  Or give a special edition uh with with
A :  Uh I suppose we can put the batteries in here because it has the most space , for example .
B :  Won't that be a problem with the L_C_D_ screen ?
A :  I don't think so because it's the biggest part of the uh of the uh
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , but the L_C_D_ screen probably needs quite the chip .
A :  Let's
C :  I think this is possible .
A :  I think it's possible . I think it's the best place yeah , you could also put 'em here . But
B :  Okay .
C :  Huh .
C :  It doesn't matter . You can actually uh place a chip for the L_C_D_ screen and at the bottom , and and wire it . Doesn't matter .
A :  Okay , so we put the batteries here .
B :  Okay , that's not a problem . Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  That's fine .
A :  Yep . Blah .
B :  I think we get the idea .
A :  Um , any other com what what are we missing here ? Something a speech recognition . Um
A :  where do we want the microphone , for example , to be ? On the side or on the or , for example , on top ? Like here .
D :  Top ?
B :  Oh , basically the idea that I had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter . 'Cause you can talk to it like this .
D :  On there .
C :  I think on top .
A :  To be
A :  Okay , I w thought maybe it's either be here or because it's mi it might interfere with the transmitter , I'm not sure . But
D :  No .
A :  'Cause transmitter would be here .
B :  Well , the email said it was a quite a small component . So I don't see that .
A :  Why uh once again , like you said , the component can be somewhere at the bottom while we wire the microphone up there . Anyway .
A :  Um yeah , it could be either be here or make a double microphone .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I wouldn't mind .
D :  .
C :  It is , I believe , also able to talk .
A :  It's able to talk to you .
B :  It's a
C :  I have a sample uh sample sensor and the speaker sensor .
A :  A speaker sensor .
C :  Uh the speaker sensor we already have , but s I don't know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor . Could it talk back ? Like uh g uh give confirmation or something .
C :  I think it can . I think if you have a a speech recognition component , then a s speaking component is not that hard to to put in either .
B :  Well , the
A :  I think so , it I think it could .
A :  Yeah . I mean it could be a all this stuff could be integrated into the L_C_D_ screen , which you could navigate with this , I suppose . Navigate through everything . If you have I think you sh I think the advanced options should be I think it sh the advanced option could also be integrated in the L_C_D_ screen , of course , because you don't have to have a button for everything . You can just navigate through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this . Think that would be fine . So that's w m would be making use of the L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm . But
B :  Yeah , but do you actually need the remote talking back ?
C :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  .
C :  Mm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  We already have a sound component , by the way , for the beep .
C :  So beep .
A :  Beep .
B :  Beep .
D :  Beep .
A :  Um , so the flashing of the beep , we have well anything . We could Yeah , but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example .
B :  At the back , yeah . Like that . Or at the side .
C :  Hmm .
A :  For how do you draw that again ?
B :  Which is .
A :  Uh whatever , looks stupid .
B :  So what's basically edi the editi idea , sorry , now ? We need to stay here and work out that .
A :  I think this is pretty
C :  I'm not sure . I should be getting new information , I guess .
D :  Oh .
A :  I think you have to stay here because we are supposed to five minutes to finish the meeting . Oh , like my the info that I got was that you're uh we're gonna work on our own because you're gonna do the market market uh analysing I'm supposed to do the little work on the year-end report . So the project report .
D :  Yep .
D :  Okay .
A :  Hmm . Okay , I think we're everybody satisfied with the with the current design we have ? So we're s supposed to be rubber . I think well , I think the the remote control is gonna be black because we we forgot to talk about I mean the the company colours are important apparently . So we have the logo up there . So are we gonna base colour is black ?
B :  Well , I suppose we'll
C :  Yes .
D :  Ah , that's fine .
B :  Pretty much .
D :  Round .
D :  Why ?
C :  But we have
C :  any company logo . We have yes , but and yellow .
A :  And yeah , of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever .
C :  I would change . I would take a yellow remote control . To have it flashy , to have it it's for young people .
A :  Yellow but yellow control . It's
B :  Yeah , but when you use covers , it basically easier to have a n have a neutral colour on the base .
A :  Okay .
C :  Need do be different .
D :  It's the colour of a
A :  Well , don't don't stick yourself on the covers right now .
A :  But don't stick yourself on the cover because
C :  Hmm .
B :  No , we're designing the remote control now , but taking that into consideration , it's better to have a neutral base colour than to have a flashy
C :  But we need to be different .
A :  Nah .
A :  Yeah , but the info . I think we should go with uh with the company colour because what specific info that I got from the project board . So I think we should go with that .
D :  But , the you
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  The young people want uh a trendy uh remote control . So colourful uh is
A :  They want something trendy .
C :  Huh .
C :  It's either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa . And I would say take a yellow cover and black buttons .
B :  It is more trendy . That's definitely true .
A :  I think we should th then take it take yellow . Take what you c yellow remote control . So let's see if if we can do the LED onto it .
C :  To be different .
D :  Yeah .
D :  You have the basic colours , blue , green , red .
A :  Uh oh .
C :  Yeah , we have so many colours already .
C :  So
A :  You know what ? I'm not gonna do this . That's up to you guys .
D :  Oh , it's okay .
C :  Oh no , that I think it's good thing to be different than
D :  Yeah . Colourful , you you
A :  You doodle a doodle us a nice nice design for for the next meeting , we'll be done . I think we're all happy now .
C :  Well
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yep .
C :  I still don't have my scroll-wheel though . Uh that's Nah , that's true .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Stupid scroll-wheel .
B :  Oh , where would you like to put it ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  I'm not sure uh I really , I'm no I have no clue what we could use the scroll-wheel for .
B :  Uh you could use it for the channels and for the volume . But it's has no real added value .
C :  No , forget it .
D :  Oh yeah .
C :  No look , it
D :  You can
A :  It takes space , a lot of space . And it could
C :  No , that's not my point . It's not because it's functional , but it's just to add to the design , to have it flashy . It it has no function , I agree . I agree .
D :  Ah may
B :  Yeah , but if it has no function , then
A :  I'm not sure if it if it has no function , why even put it there ? And th that's just so much things that make it look flash
C :  Oh , so many things have no function , just design .
D :  But uh uh scroll for a channel s selection or volume
C :  Mm-hmm . Hmm .
A :  I think channel selection would be annoying because it just c you could scroll past the channel or
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Let's vote on it . Then we don't have to talk about it any longer . What do you want ? In or out ?
D :  Oh okay .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Oh okay .
B :  Basically out . I don't see the
C :  Okay . You are out of course . You are okay , clear .
A :  .
D :  Out .
A :  No r no scroll-wheel . Okay . Um I don't see anything missing really . Yeah , we should too bad we don't have the finance . We could've
B :  Do you have all your answers ? Okay .
C :  I have all my answers , yes .
A :  Yeah , it's I'm not sure if we're if we're gonna get finance anyway because I thought we cou I thought it was gonna be an issue at the first time we started . I thought it was gonna be a cost issue which material we were gonna take relative to the advanced chips or anything . So you just do whatever you like and uh doesn't care what it costs .
D :  I have to call this in a form .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm . There is I have one question .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  I only have one question with the material , but I don't have information that . We've chosen rubber .
A :  I think we're rubber is not expensive . Definitely .
C :  No , but can we make yellow rubber ? I think so
A :  You can make rubber in any colour . In any colour . So I mean you can't make yellow titanium , but you can make yellow rubber .
B :  Yes , you can colour rubber , yeah .
D :  Ah .
C :  Okay .
D :  But we ha w we don't uh use our reco uh we uh removable cover ? No , huh ?
C :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
A :  Uh yeah we can make uh for example it's just something you can click on it like uh that's but it's not som not apparently that's not something we're working with in the basic design . So .
D :  Maybe maybe later , maybe we can uh
C :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah , it could be . It can be done , for e
A :  Can I close this ?
B :  Uh we don't have any changes , do we ? So no .
A :  Oh , okay .
A :  There we go .
A :  Okay , here we are again . Detailed design oh , come on .
A :  Well Ah s Forgot to insert the minutes , but it's about the same thing we discussed before . Uh
A :  Could open that anyway , think .
A :  Other design anyway , we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time . We also that you're just busy with it . Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features . Well , we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the other screen , which is fine . Um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black . Yellow in the back because it's m trendy , more trendy than black anyway . So then we ca yeah . We agreed that we would implement both the L_C_D_ and speech recognition , but I'll get to that in a moment . 'Cause some changes in the finances have
A :  left us implications anyway . So so , like I said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , but we have 'em now ,
D :  Hmm .
A :  and it's bad . Anyway .
A :  We are
A :  Oh . Prototype presentation , well first you guys built the prototype . So you could could present that . But um let's see what be handy to do .
A :  Nee no , you just go ahead and present the w we'll scrap it later because
C :  I think it's more or less the same as we had .
A :  What ?
B :  It's basically what we agreed upon , but just a little bit more specified .
D :  Hmm ?
A :  Oh that's
C :  No much s
A :  hasn't changed that much , huh ? I didn't expect anyway . You just coloured it .
C :  No no no , not at all .
B :  Uh s
B :  Final design .
B :  Basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here . We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad . If you put them all black , it's not really that good a contrast . So
A :  Mm-hmm . I like the menu .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber . It's it's part of the rubber , I suppose . I think that's more I think that's more durable anyway than printed on to
B :  Probab Yeah . That's the be
C :  Hmm .
B :  And it I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to uh
C :  Yeah , of course .
D :  Mm yeah .
C :  That's uh the integration story again .
D :  Okay .
B :  So we have it's a bit round shaped , that's what we had uh
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute . So that's basically what we chose there . If you have anything to add , please interrupt me .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  No , uh this is just a description of what we see there . So
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Oh .
C :  Speaks for itself .
B :  That's pretty much it .
A :  Okay . Now it's my time to ruin everything . Well , not ruin everything , but no , nah . Finances , that's what we have here , what you drew . We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway . So which you see the which is de o one of the most expensive parts . So well , we have sin one curve , a design . Rubber design . And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour . So just half a Euro for You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use . So , easy . What do we scrap . Well think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition .
B :  Oh sorry .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm .
C :  I d
C :  Yeah .
B :  I'd say that too .
A :  Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side . There are ninety one percent of uh the people , or something like that . But ninety percent who favour an L_C_D_ display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . I think it's also harder to
C :  Hmm .
B :  Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample , which you can't do with a normal remote control , which people already do . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
A :  . So I ju I took that out . So and so it's still stuck with thirteen , so I had to take out the special colour I suppose . And , yeah , I didn't see anything else I could take out .
A :  Yeah , I could take out the push-buttons , but we need those . So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it , we'll just then we'll do it in black . We'll just deliver it in black , have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . You make it d orange or whatever you want .
C :  Huh .
D :  Special colour , yeah .
B :  Well , I'd I tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this . So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ?
A :  It was a big issue , but
A :  I'll just go back . Uh let's just let's see what okay , let's just see what we no , we we have to be under twelve and a half . It it's not uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , so .
D :  Yeah , it
D :  The p
C :  Okay , but there's another problem .
D :  And the p
B :  Okay .
C :  But there's another problem . If we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , 'cause black and black doesn't work obviously .
D :  What
A :  I think you that's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together . So I think yeah , it's I think it's y one of the it's a good way to um
C :  Huh .
C :  Huh . Yeah .
A :  to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too . Just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we agreed before . And everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have . Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . But we need that for the L_C_D_ display . Then again , we have the L_C_D_ display , which is also expensive . B yeah , but those go together . And yeah , we could take out the curve .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Right .
C :  I agree .
B :  Yeah . We do .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Or say let's lose rubber , take plastic .
B :  We could take out a curve indeed .
A :  Could we could take out the curve . Is that an option ?
C :  Yes .
D :  .
A :  For you ?
C :  Although we are demolishing a little bit the style . But
D :  But uh the and
B :  I think the colour is more important than the really the curve , because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . The people
A :  I think it's it it does ruin it , but the fact that I t took that decision or t
C :  Yeah .
A :  Took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers . So you can change any colour you want . So it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want .
C :  Can we then not also uh change the material ? We take plastic for the basic cover and
A :  You can take plastic , but I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , because they're all plastic . So which in in turn Rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break .
D :  Spongy , yeah .
C :  We can put those to the to the other covers .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And
C :  That's true .
C :  But okay .
C :  But what do you then suggest we'd lose ? Because we have to lose two things and I guess .
A :  I al like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour , which would make this black a black and grey . Yeah , that's that that that's enough , because
D :  But
C :  Yes .
C :  Okay , and that's enough ?
B :  So black and grey is okay .
A :  I guess those are the basic colours . So Oh .
D :  But
C :  Hmm .
B :  Which we can fabricate , okay .
A :  I think those are basic col
D :  The people want to pay for for it , so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ?
A :  They want to
A :  To ensure the profit . That that's th that's the order . We're just uh we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this . But that's not for our that's not our decision to take . We have a budget of twelve fifty per product . So
D :  Yeah .
D :  But we can take a risk .
B :  No , we basically
D :  Okay , yeah .
C :  Hmm .
B :  We need to stick to that .
A :  Stick that . I don't think it's really bad either . I mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing
D :  I hope the people will like it , but
A :  to have I think they would do . Th I think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . So
D : 
D :  Yeah .
C :  Perhaps we should make m
D :  Yeah .
C :  Huh .
D :  The first sheet .
C :  Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . And that's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that .
A :  Well I don't think Yeah . Is it worth is it is it does it mean anything to the customer ? Like , it like , we don't care we don't care that you had to
C :  Perhaps they decide tha
B :  But they don't
C :  Of course . Perhaps they uh no , but perhaps they think uh okay , the cover is such a nice idea , uh let's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs .
C :  We ca we uh we can at least tell them that
A :  True , but we did we didn't get that . So I think it's it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something . But
C :  You don't know that .
B :  Well
C :  Huh .
C :  No , I'm not uh talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this . We could at least m uh make it like this , like you said , and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an still an option , but not for this price .
A :  They could , but uh
A :  It's an option , but yeah , it's true . So actually uh it's not that much of an increase , but yeah . We cannot contact them . It's just the order that we got . So that's what we gotta go with . So it's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final , it's either turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , um or turn it yellow . So
B :  And if we
C :  Exactly , but
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
A :  It's uh something we have to decide on .
C :  I'd say lose the curve and the colour and
A :  I say lose the curve . Oh that's true , we could lose the c yeah , I forgot that , sorry . Uh the curve . So That's just this one just d this is the banana curve .
B :  So which curve is that ba that's basically that curve .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , that's better .
A :  So this would this would be straight .
B :  So we could u still have the comfort .
A :  No , uh no , that would be a curve inside the thing , I guess . No , would ju then it would just be a straight remote . Just like like that .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . we could make it yellow then , but
B :  I second that .
A :  You second that , you second that we lose the curve .
B :  No , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . So that's not really that
A :  Okay , yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak . So we keep the curve .
C :  Hmm .
A :  So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has .
B :  I would
C :  Oh .
C :  I agree .
B :  Yeah . I would say I would agree with you on the colour , because that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money . So we can always do that .
C :  No .
D :  Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , um I guess people are willing to pay for that . So I think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . So I think that would still make it a nice product . Okay , we're final on that . So it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing . But anyways we're here . Um yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm ?
C :  Yes .
B :  Which is basically what we discussed .
A :  This we discussed just now .
A :  That's just now just we could just discuss how the project went . I mean , was kind of
D :  And I want to do that .
A :  I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way , but because you yeah , everything cannot be for free . We didn't I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time . Because that was I th it was really essential really to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost . So we just put something I think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually . So
B :  Yes , we could have
C :  Huh .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , because in the beginning I had no list of available materials , and then I d had not list of available c finances . So
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think would have been . Materials would be ok at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that . So I suppose
D :  Yeah .
D :  But
D :  Let's um see um
A :  Yeah , let's see if it sells . I mean I suppose this sells , because it's very very extended . But
D :  Um
B :  Well I hope it sells .
D :  Let's
D :  Uh
C :  Hmm .
A :  I suppose it sells , because it's good . I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price , because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway .
D :  Oh .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Okay , let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design . Um I have some uh a method , a requirements and scale of . I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not .
A :  Okay .
A :  Have been met , okay .
D :  And I will
D :  uh make a new blank sheet .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So so the buttons , the look and feel . I thought it was okay , but the advanced uh settings , um screen , audio and channel
B :  Which are basically accessible through the menu button .
A :  They're stuck under menu .
D :  We are not
A :  For the menu . I think those are totally met , because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want , they have the simplicity they want . I think it's very uh very well met . Either two or one maybe .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Oh the menu button is it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Hi Oh , okay .
D :  Then it's all uh
D :  S it's true .
C :  One .
A :  I think we took that everything they wanted into consideration . So it could either be a two or a one .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So d
D :  Oh wait . Uh pen . The p
A :  One and a half .
B :  Which is not an option .
D :  Oh yeah , it's red , okay , but
A :  Just create our own option .
D :  Look and feel is everybo it's true .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So
D :  Anyone ? And the next one uh yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it . It's
A :  It's perfect . Even for deaf people , yeah . It's I don't think it's perfect , but we did everything possible to to get it back . Because if it's stuck in you couch , you can see the light . Maybe you can hear it . But I mean we tried , so I think it that's that deserves a one .
C :  Hmm .
B :  To make it that way , yeah .
D :  Yeah . And it's
D :  and it's yeah .
A :  Definitely .
D :  To . That's okay then . And the next one .
D :  How is that ? Uh w we had we don't have an uh
C :  Manual .
D :  manual , yeah .
C :  I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , but then again , it's for young people . So
D :  But I think that's a part of it . But
A :  I'd use an remote control .
B :  Mm yeah .
D :  Yeah , an L_C_D_ , it tells a lot about uh
C :  Yeah , I th
B :  And it's pretty straight-forward , you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the L_C_D_ menus . So
A :  It's pretty straight-forward , uh-huh .
C :  Exactly .
C :  No , that's true .
C :  I think it won't be a big problem .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So it's a one or a I don't know .
B :  One I d no , actu
A :  I think but we didn't even there was no issue on making a manual actually . We didn't really discuss it , but
D :  For the advanced uh settings .
D :  No okay , that uh that's true .
A :  I don't think it takes no , it really does doesn't take time to learn , I think . We took it s it's so easy , we have so little button , everything speaks for itself really . So I think that's yeah , we didn't it's either two or one , I guess . Maybe it's a two , because d uh the L_C_D_ is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button . So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess .
D :  Oh , so it
B :  No , it it is pretty straight-forward .
C :  Ah . Um
D :  Takes no ti
C :  With the more important functions on .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  And the L_C_D_ , you have to see it .
A :  So just make that a two .
D :  Um mm
D :  Oh , it's a little bit
D :  learning .
D :  Okay . Uh yeah it's uh a little bit same . But it tells you or not ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . I think so . I think it's perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful . I think so .
D :  But wha w oh , yeah . What are we uh
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ? Just uh only the channels and or
C :  the menus uh
D :  What uh ?
C :  Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu , because we have no buttons for those .
B :  Well , basically the menu options indeed . But
D :  Oh , in the L_C_D_ screen .
A :  No , y I mean in the L_C_D_ screen , the small screen . What does it display ?
C :  Yes .
D :  And for a channel selection , uh or that's not
A :  Well I thought it was I thought it was I thought that people wanted previews on their I'm not sure if that even possible , but 'cause it's this requires a quite quite a bit of band-width . I don't think it's possible really . But
D :  Yeah , I thought I thought too but yeah .
A :  the they didn't really define in what should be used for .
D :  But
D :  Maybe a T_V_ guide or something in your L_C_D_ uh
B :  No .
A :  But I think in for example like T_V_ guides , I think that's that th that you can transmit through it and everything . Just for extra information on your programmes .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , it must be clear then what what what for we use it .
A :  But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . So that could be done by L_C_D_ display . I think it's good . No , maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly . We didn't give it I don't thing over-discussing . Now we gave it enough thought though . I think we d should just lower this . Maybe maybe it's a three though . We could've used it more effectively probably .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , indeed .
D :  So everybody's agree with an uh three on it , it's
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah . Two or three . So
A :  Yeah , we are using it , but it's not it's not poorly used , but it's not efficiently used , I think . We could have ev even lost the selection button and uh done everything via L_C_D_ selection . It's now it's just extra to illustrate im uh extra features , but okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I
D :  A three .
C :  Nah , it's not really only an extra . No menus . Think about
B :  You can seven .
D :  Ah , nothing , that's
D :  A seven . Uh that's uh
A :  Can you talk to remote control ? Well , it can't talk anymore . So we scrap that .
B :  Or we could say it
D :  Yeah .
B :  Or we could say neutral , we 'cause we scratched the
A :  Oh yeah Just to be a prick , but of course you can talk to your remote control , it doesn't do anything . But you c you can talk to it .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Not with the speech recognition . Uh yeah , all the trends and no colours uh anymore . So
A :  Well , we did take everything into consideration of course . Uh the shape i shape is i
D :  Yeah , uh um only in the curves .
A :  I think we yeah , I think that's okay .
D :  But the colours , we don't have special colours on it .
B :  No , we don't have the colour . So I
A :  Yeah , special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable to the fashi
D :  Yeah , but we yeah , we don't have it , so d
B :  Yes , but the end product So
C :  Hmm .
A :  We don't have it we do have it , it's just sold as a package . It does it's not part of the basic product .
D :  In the end product .
C :  But
C :  Changing covers is also trend that we followed .
A :  It that that's what I call trendy . I mean the shape is trendy . The the sh the the functions are trendy . It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . Because you ha it's just not affordable at the moment .
D :  Now
D :  But it's not a one .
B :  Maybe we should go with a two then , because it's not perfect , because we can't do it initially , but we
D :  Yeah .
D :  Oh .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It's possible , but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour .
D :  Oh well
D :  Oops .
D :  Oh it's a two , right ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  On the last one . Uh that n that's all .
A :  Overall score .
B :  Overall score .
D :  Overall . It's um
A :  One two three . sixteen .
D :  ten , sixteen
D :  three uh two two point seven or something like that .
A :  Two two point some two point something .
C :  Hmm .
D :  I don't know why .
B :  Ten , sixteen ,
A :  .
B :  divided by
C :  Six .
D :  Six .
B :  Is two two third .
A :  Two and two thirds .
D :  Um
D :  So we can say it's it's the product is it's okay .
A :  It's okay , but that's yo m mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . 'Cause yeah , that gives you a seven , which ruins your your average .
D :  Y not
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  There's
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Without that it would be like under it wouldn't yeah , it would be under two . So I think we have even with this it's reasonable .
D :  Woah .
B :  Yeah , if we make it into a four , as in neutral , because we didn't implement it , so we can't say that we that it's really not well implemented . We come out on a average of two one eighth .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well I think it's two is okay .
B :  So which is pretty w good . It's at least on the positive side . So We could definitely have done better if we've had more resources , but
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , two is pretty good .
C :  Hmm , of course .
A :  Definitely .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think it's probably I I do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display . We could have used it more efficiently , we just didn't think of it that way .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . True .
D :  Yeah , with .
A :  So like I said , changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything .
D :  The scale .
C :  But I think for this price , this is it's really a reasonable product . It's a good product .
A :  I think we div I think we did very well , uh ev even if you look at this score , we did quite well . It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved . So .
D :  Yeah .
D :  With an L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Oh .
C :  Oh . Yeah . But if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , because it's cannot be done for this .
D :  Yeah , you can make 'em another one .
A :  They sh they should get kids , and just stick 'em in T_V_ and say change the channel .
C :  Hmm yeah .
C :  Ah but for this price uh you cannot ask that . You cannot th think of that
A :  I don' think so . Uh it's just not it it's not affordable . Or your sh you should lose the L_C_D_ screen probably , but I think that's I think the L_C_D_ screen is more worth than speech recognition .
C :  No , it's not .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Oh It's also more attractive .
A :  Definitely . Okay , that was that .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So that's the final product without the speakers , I guess . Let's see , what was left in the the Another one .
B :  So did you
A :  Hmm . Yeah , we evaluate the product . General project , what's i in For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , which I thought was pretty creative , because it was never never ever listed somewhere .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Favourite channel .
A :  Well
A :  Anyways . Yeah , leadership is up to you . I mean perhaps I screwed up because I d put a put a speech recognition into it . But that's not for me to decide . I think we did pretty well as team-work though . Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results , initially of course I wanted to contact you . Say , look , this is you're doing the wrong thing , you're s you're wasting your time now , because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford . So it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh because that's that's what would w you what you would normally do , either call or email someone . So that was too bad con was impossible here anyways . .
D :  Yeah , I know . Yeah .
C :  Yes .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , you're working separate .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Huh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah yeah .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah . Direct uh communication with yeah .
B :  And we could share information which we received .
C :  Hmm .
C :  That's the same thing that I had in the beginning . Everybody was using materials that s I didn't have . So
A :  It didn't have or didn't knew what they costs or whatever . There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . So that was a little unclear I suppose . I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool . I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Oh .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
D :  My handwriting is little bit yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , because
A :  It's a little less it the response time is le it's very bad . It's good to visualise everything , but I think the response time should could be a lot better .
C :  Hmm .
B :  The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to
D :  But th that's
A :  Definitely .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , it's true .
D :  Yeah , okay .
B :  further elaborate on that . So
C :  But there's uh also one problem with this I noticed . Uh you have to finish a page before going to a n
A :  No , you don't have to . No , you don't . I jin I didn't check the finish button . I just you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever . Uh only if you uh check the notes or press done . Then it um then you can then it exports to Word automatically . But it's not necessary to check either one of those two . You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme .
D :  No . You can
C :  Oh .
D :  Done and then it's okay .
C :  Okay , I saw that uh
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah , but I made
D :  Oh , okay .
C :  Okay , but I made three pages and they were not finished . And when the third one was finished , I wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore , because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further .
D :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Okay , before starting a ne a new page . Okay , that could be b .
D :  Okay .
C :  Exactly . So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible . You have to finish it completely , then download it , it's then start a new one . That's not very uh handy , but if you know that , then it's not a problem .
D :  Oh .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  Oh can you ? Okay .
A :  Yeah , okay .
A :  That's
A :  Yeah , it's understandable , okay . Any new ideas ? Yeah , more communication between between uh that's the thing I noticed , that communication is very um very important , because if you get new information , it's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition , you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side . So I think that could have been better . But that's I think it's more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh than somewhere else . So
D :  Important to mm
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah , well it could also possibly be well , is it a more real-time information base , so we can all see which information is available to one another .
A :  Yeah , I think so . And l less p less spam probably . I'm not sure i I'm not sure you got spammed as well , but I get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a there was another email about master classes or something . So which were totally useless actually . I thought I should probably look into them , but they were all useless . So I just
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Ah .
C :  Well
C :  Hmm .
B :  Well , I personally did not have that , but
D :  Mm
A :  Oh okay .
B :  That's probably your l description . But I also didn't not really . But still , you had that as well . Is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website , and then there was just extra information .
C :  Huh .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , after
C :  .
D :  After five minutes , uh
C :  Yeah ,
B :  There was a little delay in the bit of a c
D :  Yeah .
A :  I didn't have any uh more information , it's just always the same here . So that's that's kind of a
B :  crucial delay .
C :  Mm .
D :  Email uh
A :  It would change , but not for me . So I'd I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually . I couldn't do any research myself or I see , that's yeah , w I could have done a little extra work probably , then
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  it's
A :  But I was busy enough anyway . So
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Any new ideas found ? Or is that a 'cause uh yeah , it's well , probably is .
C :  No .
B :  How much time do we have for this anyway ?
A :  I have no clue . That's like oh,but it
C :  .
A :  Should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget , we should celebrate . So
C :  Okay , bring out the beer .
B :  Yeah . Champagne .
A :  Uh okay , think that's about it . Uh
D :  I want one for my own .
A :  I'm not sure what we should still do though uh t let's see what all your tasks were finished , right ? What you ha from your assistant . So let's
D :  Yeah .
C :  I have no more email . My coach is uh being very silent now .
D :  Yeah , my personal coach i
A :  Okay , I should I think I sh I still have the the total report to finish up . I think we took very little time now , because
A :  Yeah , we're in agreement , everything the design is okay . The one thing we missed though ,
A :  we don't have a product name .
D :  What
C :  No , we haven't think above about that . Huh . It's better than thi I think than a serial number . Sony uh T_R_ something uh f means nothing to me . Uh
A :  How about you cook a how about you cook up a product name ?
B :  Product name .
D :  Yeah , name .
D :  Or fruit name .
A :  Just oh , think of a catchy name . I'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps . So
C :  Like fruit names .
D :  Fruit name or something like that . The banana remote or something . I don't know . Yeah , it's the form of it .
A :  What ? Fruit ?
A :  You don't want it to resemble a banana . It's not yellow anyway . It's not yellow anymore . It is curved , but
B :  The bana 'cause it's not yellow anymore .
D :  Yeah oh , yeah .
D :  Uh yeah .
B :  Well , uh I was going for the R_C_ deluxe , but it's not really a catchy name or anything , it's more
D :  Uh
A :  No , it's
C :  Uh at least it's not something with numbers . Numbers are so meaningless to the people . I mean
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Something with our company name , can we do anything with that ?
D :  That's true .
C :  .
D :  Reaction , Real Reaction .
B :  Maybe there's something on the website which will help us out .
C :  Real Reaction .
B :  The reaction deluxe .
A :  Real Reaction future R_C_ .
A :  Step into the future of of remote controlling your T_V_ .
B :  Is that a name or a c campaign ? Yeah .
A :  No that's a that's a catchy slogan .
B :  Or the
A :  Control your remote control .
B :  The real reactor .
C :  Real react .
A :  I go for future R_C_ probably .
A :  Something like
C :  The Real Reactor , I don't find that uh that bad at all .
A :  It's short f
D :  .
A :  Real reactor ?
C :  Yeah . Because our name is Real Reaction .
B :  You should write it down as a an option .
A :  Uh that that's
D :  .
A :  That makes me think of different products than a remote control really .
A :  I'm not sure . Real reaction in a real
D :  Zapping .
D :  The
B :  So that's one option .
A :  Real reactor .
A :  Didn't notice .
C :  I'm looking for things in the name . So that the first three letters are s the same . R_E_A_ R_E_A_ .
A :  Mm .
B :  Should I write the banana down or
D :  Yeah , sure .
A :  I take f yeah , take a banana .
B :  Sure ?
D :  The banana .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Remote .
D :  Banana recei R_C_ .

B :  Uh do you mean it like
C :  ?
D :  R_ three C_ .
C :  yeah .
B :  You mean it like this ?
C :  Yeah , that
D :  Real Reaction Remote Control . R_ three C_ . Oh yeah .
C :  .
A :  No , not like that . It should be it should be longer , because it's not a product name that you f print on a box .
C :  .
C :  I think
C :  triple R_ . Doesn't sound ?
A :  Just write out triple , like a word triple R_C_ , triple stripe Oh . Triple dash R_ dash s s C_ .
D :  Yeah , triple R_ .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Triple R_C_ .
C :  Ah .
D :  The triple R_C_ , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  R_ s R_ three C_ .
D :  .
A :  R_ dash C_ .
B :  Dash C_ ?
C :  I think I like it like this more .
A :  Dash . Triple R_ or triple R_C_ ?
B :  Like a C_ right now or a dash in a C_ ?
D :  Triple R_ dash .
A :  How about do both ?
A :  Sure if it looks stupid .
A :  Uh I think that the the R_C_ together takes away the the the image of it's a triple
C :  Hmm .
A :  Uh the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control , but it's only a single remote control . And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important . The Real Reaction Remote .
C :  Mm .
D :  That
D :  Yeah , this yeah .
C :  I would huh . I would lose the C_ and just name it triple R_ .
B :  Is it triple R_C_s ? No .
C :  It sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it . I would just say triple R_s triple R_
A : 
D :  Triple remote .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , triple R_ yeah , you can
B :  Well , that's another option .
C :  That's also short , catchy .
D :  It's okay .
A :  Yeah , triple R_ .
B :  Okay , so which ones are we going to scratch
D :  The banana . Banana .
B :  definitely ?
C :  Banana .
A :  Banana remote .
B :  I say this one as well .
D :  Yeah , the deluxe .
A :  I think we're all in agreement about the triple R_ . I think triple R_ is cool .
C :  .
C :  Yes .
D :  The r triple R_ .
B :  Triple R_ ?
B :  Triple R_ it is .
A :  And it looks cool when you print it in font , looks pretty cool .
D :  Yeah .
C :  did you do now ?
A :  Just like this just and you just print triple R_ , it looks doesn't look bad , it's short , it's okay . So have to write my report now , I guess . Um
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um
A :  Yeah , so we have everything . We have the product , we have the costs , we have the possibility of everything . Okay . I think it's adjourned . Retire to my lair and finish the report .
C :  Yep .
D :  It can't work . That will not
A :  That was a short meeting .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But efficient though .
C :  The boss is always the last one to go home . So
A :  Probably . See . Okay , goodbye .
D :  Okay .
C :  See you in a minute .
D :  Damn .
D :  I will write that one
D :  in a Word uh document .
C :  Okay .
A :  Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ?
B :  Yeah , sure .
C :  Can't we take this one ?
D :  Oh sh
C :  Otherwise we have to do it all over again .
D :  Um
B :  I don't really know whether we can save it as a picture or no .
C :  Is it okay if I try ? Is that okay with you ?
B :  Sure .
D :  Yeah , okay , I will ask you when uh I need the information . So it's oh .
C :  I'll put it back in a minute .
C :  Okay , it has been saving something , but where to I don't know .
D :  Uh
