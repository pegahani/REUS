D :  Hmm .
A :  Okay . Good morning everybody . Um I'm glad you could all come . I'm really excited to start this team . Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . My name is Rose Lindgren . I I'll be the Project Manager .
A :  Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . And then we'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes .
A :  First of all our project aim . Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . Um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts . First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating .
A :  Okay , we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . So um , what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina . Um Alima , sorry , Alima . Um we're gonna do a little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . Um introduce yourself , um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it .
B :  Alima .
B :  Okay . Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me .
A :  Probably both .
B :  Right , so , I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . I have no drawing skills whatsoever . But uh let's see , introduce myself . My name is Alima Bucciantini . Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . I'm doing nationalism studies ,
B :  blah , blah , blah , and I have no artistic talents .
A :  How do you spell your name ?
B :  A_ L_ I_ M_ A_ .
A :  Thanks .
B :  Oh , and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . So let's see if I can get um here . I will draw a little turtle for you all . Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they're drawable .
B :  And you have the pretty little shell going on .
B :  Some little eyes . Happy .
B :  There you go . That's a turtle .
D :  Yes .
A :  So what are your favourite characteristics ?
B :  Um . I I like the whole having a shell thing . It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , um quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , um and they're easy to draw .
A :  Mm .
A :  Excellent . Shall we just go around the table ?
C :  Uh Okay . Well , my name is Iain uh
A :  Mm .
C :  and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . Um .
C :  I'll try and draw my favourite animal .
B :  No , you can erase the turtle , it's alright .
C :  I'll I should leave that one on there shouldn't I before I callously rub it off .
A :  Might be nice to have them all up there at same time .
C :  Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um .
C :  Is that at least identifiable ?
B :  Snake . Well , snake ? It's w
D :  Well .
C :  It's a whale , yes . Thanks . Um and , yeah , the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're well , first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . And I just find them interesting animals .
D :  Oh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do .
D :  Take my contraptions with me .
D :  Alright , I'm Jessy . I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ .
D :  And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , animal .
D :  Don't really know how to draw this .
D :  Just where can I
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
D :  Maybe if I do the water , but how ?
D :  Sort of give an idea . I have no idea how one would explain this .
D :  Mm maybe with some whiskers .
D :  Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal .
D :  You can imagine it in the water . I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time .
D :  Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Mm 'kay ? I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager , from California .
A :  Um .
A :  Hmm .
A :  S
B :  Oh , a cat .
D :  It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Um it's actually a coyote . Let's see . Let's see , let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth .
B :  Right .
D :  That's impressive .
B :  That's
A :  Yeah .
B :  That's pretty impressive .
C :  Cool .
A :  Oh dear . Yes . I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California . We have coyotes howl all the time . So I really enjoy their their singing , you they're really beautiful animals . Mm .
A :  Okay um , moving on to
A :  slightly more serious stuff . We're gonna talk about project finances . Um we have a couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics .
A :  Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for .
A :  Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so
D :  Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , I don't know . Now they keep combining all different remotes together , and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . I just wanna watch the T_V_ um .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Always gets lost . Some sort of like
D :  device to help you find it .
C :  I've used , I've used remote controls , for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder and
C :  I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel . So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . Um .
A :  Mm .
C :  I find them they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um .
C :  And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume .
B :  Yeah um .
B :  I agree with having too many remotes around . My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and I don't know how to work half of them um .
B :  What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing .
B :  And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . Um , I think there is a way around that , but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , and I think that's if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So
D :  What about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require
D :  like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ?
A :  Um I would imagine all of them , but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s . Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . Um .
B :  I know .
B :  Yeah , something that doesn't
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Um . Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . So um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . So how do we work with that ?
B :  Yeah . Could we get something that
C :  Mm .
B :  just has
B :  No doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  channel changing .
D :  And maybe that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here , then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , 'cause then you like , I don't even know what I'm turning on .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  N that way
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well . So like you have to have them somewhere , 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote .
B :  Um .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
C :  Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television
A :  Good question .
C :  would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ?
A :  I don't know that yet .
C :  Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ?
B :  Mm .
A :  It's a good question . Um .
A :  I'll look into that .
D :  Mm-hmm hmm .
A :  If I can .
D :  I think it's just T_V_ , I mean , if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say .
B :  Mm yeah .
D :  You know , things might be more advanced than that .
A :  Mm .
C :  So we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control .
C :  Well , I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I I don't know if that works technologically or not .
B :  Yes . I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  It's an idea with the buttons being really .
B :  Large . If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . 'Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . Mind if we move on ? Ps mm okay . Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um ,
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  'Kay .
B :  Hmm .
A :  but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design . Um the User Interface Designer , that's for . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm 'kay um . And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . I realised in this past one we we didn't have much , we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . Um so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are um .
A :  Any questions ?
C :  What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? Do we know that ?
A :  I haven't gotten an agenda yet , um I'll put that together . I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together . So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time
C :  Right .
C :  Yep .
B :  'Kay .
C :  Yep .
B :  I'm sure we'll be busy .
A :  Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . Um just including all the things that we talked about . Um .
C :  Okay .
C :  Can you e-mail your slides as well ? Is that possible ?
A :  Yes , I yes , I think I can . Mm-hmm . I'll just attach it to an email . And you're you're number two , three , four ? Is that correct ? Okay .
C :  Cool .
B :  I'm two .
D :  I'm four .
B :  Alright .
A :  Excellent . It was lovely meeting you all .
A :  Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Let me see if I can do that right now .
A :  Good to see you all again . Let's see if that comes up .
A :  This is our functional design meeting .
A :  Um .
A :  Just a sec while my PowerPoint comes up .
A :  Et voila .
A :  Okay . Mm um we put the fashion in electronics .
A :  Let's start . Okay , our agenda today um just check the time , it's twelve thirteen .
A :  Um .
A :  I'm gonna do an opening , talk about um did you all get the minutes ? I e-mailed them to you . I'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder . So um then I we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions . Finally we'll just close . We're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . So
C :  Yep .
B :  Right .
A :  First of all the functional design objectives . Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function .
A :  Okay , three presentations , um you can go in any order you choose um .
D :  Mm shall we go in the order that you just did it ?
A :  Sure , please do .
D :  I dunno .
D :  How do I hook my screen up ?
B :  I think , you might have to disconnect Rose .
A :  Yes I do .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there
D :  Where does it go ? Mm-hmm .
D :  Hmm , I'm not supposed to move this , but
C :  Ah that's it , yep .
C :  And then you have to press function F_ eight I think it is on your laptop .
A :  Function , F_ eight , yeah .
D :  Where's function ?
A :  The blue one , F_N_ .
D :  No signal .
A :  Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and
D :  Ah , wait , 's screw in .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I I think you just have to push it in really hard .
D :  Push the screw .
C :  That's it .
B :  Oh , got it .
A :  Mm 'kay . It's taking it a little bit
D :  Mm alright
D :  I've never attached to anything .
B :  Mm , neither have I .
A :  'Kay there you go .
D :  Alright , so , I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is .
B :  Alright .
D :  But , I don't even know how to play this .
D :  No .
A :  Press the little presentation . It's the um it looks like a Y_ kind of over there above Draw .
A :  There , that one , there you go .
D :  Alright . So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research . They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had .
D :  What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . I don't know anything beyond what fancy means , but that's particularly of use to us , I think . Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions .
B :  Hmm .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Um people also had certain frustrations , that I think that we could try to take into consideration with
D :  our design . That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes . I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is , because I don't know .
B :  Hmm .
C :  Repetitive strain injury .
D :  What ?
C :  Repetitive strain injury .
D :  Ah . There we go . Wow . People do not like that . So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , um the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain . Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote .
C :  So if you
D :  And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on .
D :  So I think that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on
D :  what people's preferences on that were , so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Thank you very much . That was that was great . Um 's move on to the next presentation um on effects . Was that you ? Great .
B :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , have I unscrewed it ?
A :  Push .
A :  User interface , right .
A :  Interface .
D :  Here we go .
C :  Cheers .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And I think that's in the shared , if I did it right , if anyone wants to look at it .
A :  Mm 'kay , thank you .
B :  Okay , great .
A :  Okay .
C :  Here we go .
C :  Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um .
C :  We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , uh yeah , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness .
C :  Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ?
C :  First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , uh how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product .
C :  Um .
C :  Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about
C :  h how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . Um ,
A :  Hmm .
C :  and different different people sort of prefer different things .
C :  Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people . But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out .
C :  Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . The second is is economic , uh we need to find a balance between features and price . So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product .
A :  Hmm .
C :  So I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them , uh what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls .
C :  Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . Yeah , it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ .
C :  The one on the right is a lot more basic . It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts . There are disadvantages , you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture . Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . So we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two .
C :  Um as I said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want want different things . Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it it's easy to use , uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . It it does everything that I need it to uh , as I said before , I'm quite lazy , I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television . I also want something that that looks cool , um and that that feels good , that's ergonomically designed .
A :  Mm 'kay . Thank you very much . That was very useful . It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes . Um .
B :  Hmm .
A :  And neither of them were very pretty , you know ?
D :  No .
B :  Yeah . I think that could be our selling point .
A :  Mm .
D :  A fashion fashion remote .
C :  I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool . And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress .
B :  Right .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Hmm . Right , I really can't see what I'm doing , so does anyone have a
D :  Yeah .
A :  You there it is .
B :  Ah-ha , look at that , showing up already .
A :  Lovely .
D :  So wait , did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see ?
C :  Uh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah .
D :  Okay . 'Cause I was like googling and then I'm like wait it won't let me google .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Alright um
B :  No , how do I play again ?
A :  Um the it's right above Draw . There are three thingy if it's way at the bottom . Under three icons and it's the one that looks like a desk . Yeah , that one . There are Y_s .
B :  Ah .
B :  Okay . So this is our working design presentation . Um I had a bit of some issues with this , because I wasn't able to find everything I needed , but I guess that's we're still in early stages . Um so , yeah , this is this . Though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function .
B :  Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . Don't know if I'm explaining that very well , but how do I get to the next s ah .
B :  So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done . So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
B :  at which you need something to happen . So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted
B :  tsh towards this practical function . And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately . So um
B :  Uh . Uh .
A :  You just press yeah , just click . That'll be fine .
B :  So the findings that I got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line . So that's one thing we're gonna work on . Um the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial .
B :  And really it all comes down to the to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . So the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this . You have your energy source right there which then um brings
B :  uh energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users . You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh uh .
A :  Um yeah use that thing you can go back , previous .
B :  Previous .
B :  Sorry about that , guys .
A :  Pardon .
B :  Oh .
A :  Oh , well . Okay .
B :  No , no , no , no , no . Okay , let's just get back to my schematic here .
A :  Double click on it .
A :  With the right with the left hand one .
B :  W yeah , yeah . I think it's frozen . Here . Don't show me that tip again . There we are . Sorry about this , guys . I'm kind of pathetic with things like this . Um alright . So you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver . So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way . This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out . And personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it a lot . We need a chip that works well with the user interface , that isn't too complicated .
A :  There we are .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands . So that's pretty much it for the working design .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Excellent .
A :  So , um .
B :  Rose , do you think you can give me a hand with this ?
A :  Yes , absolutely .
A :  Ah I can never tell which way to turn these things .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Lefty loosey , righty tighty , right ? Lefty loosey , righty tighty .
B :  Yeah .
C :  What's up ?
C :  Lefty loosey .
C :  Uh . Never heard that before , that's good .
A :  Oh yes .
C :  I'll think of that every time now .
B :  It's gonna stick in your head .
D :  Yeah , that's a good one it'll stick with you .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Um I have nothing on my screen .
A :  Just a sec .
B :  Mm .
A :  Here we are .
B :  Ooh , no signal .
A :  Okay , yeah , it's fine .
A :  Okay , requirements . We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this . We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because um well it that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about um we're not gonna worry about that .
B :  Okay .
D :  What's teletext ?
B :  Uh , it's a British thing .
A :  Um .
D :  Oh . Oh , so
C :  You don't have it in the States ?
B :  No .
A :  It no . W d could would you care to explain it ?
C :  Oh , I didn't realise . Um yeah , it's like a
C :  I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser . Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control , uh y and you type in the page number you want , so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Lottery numbers and sport scores .
C :  Yep , news headlines .
B :  But if you ever see the T_V_ saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now , that's what they're talking about .
A :  How ?
D :  Oh .
C :  It's earl it's pretty old technology . It's like nineteen eighties .
A :  Okay .
D :  That explains a lot .
B :  I have no idea why we don't have it , but
D :  That's good .
A :  Interesting . Okay um , well , we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that . Um
A :  Okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . Just for television . That's what we're focused on . Um otherwise becomes to complex , we wanna get this out um very quickly . We only have a a short amount of time .
C :  Right .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Um and finally there's more marketing , I think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable . So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design .
B :  Mm .
C :  So what's our corporate image like ? It's It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics .
A :  Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the R_s in um mm-hmm .
C :  It's like double R_ .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But it's , yeah , we put the um
A :  fashion in electronics . So we gotta keep that in that in mind .
B :  Okay , so we want something that looks good
A :  Yep . Yep .
B :  and is yellow .
A :  Yeah , or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow . Like , we can we can play around with it a little bit .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um .
A :  Okay , we need to talk about our functions and our target group . We need to decide who our target group is . You um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences , for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition , but younger people did . Um and so who are we aiming this at ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this .
D :  Yes , I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ?
A :  Mm-hmm . It's gonna be twenty five Euro remember , so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television ? 'Cause that would affect the way that we market it .
A :  Well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five Euro by itself .
C :  Right .
C :  Right , okay .
D :  The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea . I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be a fairly good target group for us .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Now , those are that's all specific for speech recognition . Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ?
C :  Um .
B :  Mm .
C :  I I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price .
C :  Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying uh , well , uh we've got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for to produce it ? And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  To produce it , yeah .
A :  To produce it , yes .
A :  Mm .
D :  But what else are we gonna put , I mean not that I'm really gung-ho about it , I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though . So like other than just making it look good , how is it I mean it can look really great and still have the same up-n-down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
B :  But right .
B :  Well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology , in fact it could use it could mean , not . If they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  That's a good thing to keep in mind .
D :  If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ? I dunno .
A :  Upgrade ? Well , we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly .
B :  Yeah , simplification . They could have a crap remote that came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they're just missing it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Simplification , so
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh-huh , mm .
A :  And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or
D :  Can you like I mean this may be too complicated , but , I wish I had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons , but the rest of them like went in . Do you know what I'm saying ?
B :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Ooh .
C :  The remote There are remote controls like that , yeah . Like some T_V_s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons . So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down and there's all the all the special buttons .
A :  Kind of pull out of the side .
A :  Mm .
B :  Ooh .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out . And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , that's a good idea .
D :  more complicated ones , but 's all still in one .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I think that's a good idea , yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information , but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing . Um .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Good point . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay um , so what are we emphasising ?
A :  I what in this project ?
C :  Si simplicity and fashion .
D :  I think simplicity , fashion .
A :  Simplicity and fashion .
B :  Yeah mm .
A :  Okay , those are very good goals , I think , um that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do . Simplicity and fashion and , yeah , or usability speci however you wanna say that , which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , so that you don't have to travel around a lot .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
D :  What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , like why would it not be ? I'm just wondering .
A :  I think it's a lot to do with battery , but that's just my
D :  Okay .
B :  The battery and that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So 's just the quality of the chip .
B :  Yeah . I think so .
D :  Okay .
B :  The quality uh quality of all the components really , I mean , we can't really do anything shoddy work , 'cause it's
C :  Yeah .
B :  gonna be visible down the line .
A :  So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ?
D :  Well , I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing
A :  S voice recognition , which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control , like it might be necessary for a T_V_ but not for the remote c , you know . Seems a little bit
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . I don't .
C :  It's , yeah , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech .
B :  Mm-mm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah , and it might be too expensive .
D :  And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T_V_ .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote .
B :  Ooh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm yeah . Maybe I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also , which isn't , I mean , really isn't that representative , especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , so
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something .
A :  Under sixty five , okay , that's a good start . Um .
C :  Yep .
A :  I'd say we're uh can we narrow it down to maybe um
A :  teenagers and families ?
A :  'Cause that would go up to like fifty ?
B :  Or like single professionals or something .
D :  Twenty to like fifty five .
A :  Okay , single
D :  I dunno .
B :  Yeah .
A :  It's it's hard to narrow it down .
B :  It's really hard to figure out right now .
C :  I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . I mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , and that might be older people , but then we've also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , maybe we can define it by like the demographic of
A :  Right .
D :  like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that , like , well obviously it has to be someone who owns a television , and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing .
C :  Yeah . Yeah aim for a an income group .
B :  That's a good point .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because , yeah , things so different will appeal to different people , but
B :  Yeah , t probably .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Um oh , there're a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ?
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Like a button on a T_V_ you can press and it'll ring or something , I don't know like or beep ?
D :  I mean , like I said before , fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in . It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think , so
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , that'll probably be good .
A :  Okay , we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions . So let's do that quickly . Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost .
C :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And we want
A :  we want large buttons for the essential things .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Large , accessible buttons for the essentials .
A :  We want a possibility to um to get um
A :  a possibility to get the extra functions .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Which are kind of hidden away in some way or
C :  well not hidden but they're uh
C :  they're not as prominent as the main features .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Um , yeah , hidden way .
A :  And we also want it to be fashionable , which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah
D :  on your coffee table , it's not like an eye sore , that kind of thing .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Alright .
A :  Okay , do it . Any other essential functions that we need ?
A :  Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ?
B :  Battery battery use . Yeah , but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really .
D :  Yeah .
A :  But we might as well .
D :  So you never have to change the battery .
B :  Yeah .
C :  We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all .
C :  I suspect the remote control does need a battery , but
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I would imagine . Just 'cause it is an electronic device , the
C :  I dunno if you can
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . It I think it does . I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one . But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod .
C :  Yeah , without the energy , yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's that's possible . Yeah .
B :  You could we could maybe do that instead . So you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery .
A :  Charging .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
A :  We have to think about um space in living-rooms , too , like 'cause they're I mean , would you put it on top of the T_V_ ? I don't know , just think okay , that's that's a good idea , we'll keep it . Think it's
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah . That's just off the top of my head .
A :  And maybe fun .
A :  Okay . Um 'kay we're gonna conclude now , has everyone said their functions and 'kay .
C :  Yep .
A :  Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary . I don't know what summarisation . Um and then we'll have our lunch break . After that we have thirty minutes of individual work . Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides . If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great .
A :  Um you each have individual actions , I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching . And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you . And hopefully , I hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could .
B :  Yeah , who knows .
A :  It's kinda frustrating , but um
A :  Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary .
A :  Mm 'kay ?
B :  Sounds good .
A :  Great seeing y'all .
A : 
D :  It's good .
D :  Did you um were you able to like put yours in the group folder ? Okay .
B :  Yes , I just did that . Hopefully it is there for people . Yeah ?
D :  Yep .
A :  Looks like there are um looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's that I didn't do , it's from like an earlier project , I think so um
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Where is that ? Yours is
A :  Under the shared folder , I don't know it might not even be under yours as well . Projects .
B :  Technical . So in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements . At least that's what I have in .
D :  I only have three , I just have like our three . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's what I have as well , R Rose So .
A :  Okay . You don't have mine ?
D :  No , but that's 'cause I think yours is in the e-mail separate , like it's not on the server .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  But if I open it and then save it , probably will be there . Oh wait , never mind you can't save it to the
A :  Okay . Well I'll figure that out in the meantime .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  I g yeah .
A :  Time is it ?
D :  Fourteen twenty six .
A :  Okay . Lovely to see you all again . Um it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . Um okay our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close .
A :  So opening . Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay , now three presentations . I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching .
B :  That would be me .
C :  Yep .
B :  Alright .
B :  Well .
A :  Mm . 'kay .
A :  Function F_ eight it . There we go .
B :  Alright .
B :  Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it . Components design . This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of .
B :  Um . So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like .
B :  The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic .
B :  That would be our case . Um buttons , for buttons we have um pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . We're talking about long-life batteries here . Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up .
A :  Mm .
B :  Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . Or a solar battery , although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you . So those are our options .
B :  Um personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . Maybe titanium , maybe some wood . We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . And we wanna go for simplicity . Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything
A :  Mm .
B :  any ideas on that ? I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t
B :  technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . That's what I have for options . Um I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing .
D :  Is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing ?
B :  I'm not sure . I haven't received any specific
D :  Okay . 'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing , but I've no idea .
B :  visuals of this yet .
B :  This is what I'm sort of
B :  Yeah . I'm not sure , but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures .
D :  Sounds good .
A :  Yeah , I wonder
B :  I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it .
B :  But the titanium , they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . Space-age remote .
C : 
A :  Mm-hmm . Just an interesting marketing kind of element .
B :  Just all things to keep in mind . Yeah .
B :  That's about all I have to do , guys . I hope I didn't go through that too quickly .
A :  Uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements , have you no idea , okay .
B :  Yeah , n no idea , no idea .
B :  I'm assuming
B :  that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , and that a tita titanium is very light , I know , um but other than that's really basic , I mean , that's all I have gotten so far . Alright ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  Any other questions ?
C :  Uh-huh . Don't think so .
B :  No ? Okay .
B :  I have save this in the uh shared projects , if anyone wants to look and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . Uh
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Thank you , perfect .
D :  Thanks .
A :  Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um underneath our oh , uh in your book , then don't worry about that .
B :  Just in my notebook , but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something .
B :  Alright ? Uh I guess I can
A :  'Kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface .
A :  Yeah , um . This one's so much tighter than the other one .
B :  I know .
A :  Okay . Nope .
A :  There we go . Here you are .
C :  Jess .
B :  G oh , geez .
C :  Alright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device .
C :  Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable .
C :  other we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people .
C :  We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . And of course we also have to make it look cool .
C :  So basically , that's what we don't want . M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . We want something that looks nice and simple .
C :  Here's a a fairly simple device . This is an an iPod from Apple . Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . It's very minimalistic in its design . Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . Um the thing I like about this is that
B :  Hmm .
C :  it's very very quick to access the main features . Uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause . They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time . Um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um
C :  here's a another example . This is uh it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool . Um it's certainly got novelty value . Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun .
A :  Mm .
C :  So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . I mean most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored .
C :  Um other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ , uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ . Um but these are these are all necessary functions . Uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod .
C :  So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . And that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ?
C :  I think that's that's one way to go , yes . Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're I well we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display .
B :  Right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right .
C :  The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . Uh
C :  a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . I mean that that's also a good idea . It's it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make .
B :  'Kay .
A :  I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . Um and so like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . Like I I know I use that often enough .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well
B :  Are you are you tak
C :  Yeah .
D :  Wait , but is that separate from what he was saying ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Well if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a
B :  No , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , that that would be one of the features , yes .
A :  Okay . 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box , mm-hmm .
C :  But it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control
C :  the c uh communication is one way , so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can . Um I'm not sure .
B :  Oh , good point .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , now we're moving on to market . Marketing .
D :  Should I plug that in ?
C :  Is that going on ? Okay .
D :  Maybe it's just not Is it on ?
C :  Uh that should be alright , actually .
D :  Ri What F_ do you have to press , five ?
A :  Eight .
D :  I just keep pressing lots of 'em .
D :  Well , I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be . If anything , the that they gave me . Alright .
A :  Oops , it's not plugged in , quite in well enough .
B :  No signal .
A :  There we are .
B :  Oop , there we go .
A :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Oh yeah .
D :  Okay , so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching . Basically , I was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . So first um they had people they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to
D :  the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account .
B :  Okay .
D :  The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . I don't know how much we agree with that . And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , tight material . And so that brings us to my personal preferences . Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding . Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so
A :  S sweet .
D :  even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , I don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away . Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . But it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material .
B :  Mm .
B :  That there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though .
D :  Yeah . I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them , that pretty much sums it up . So yeah .
A :  Okay , do we have any s some questions for this , let's see um .
D :  Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ?
A :  Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? It would be easier on the hands .
B :  If it's latex if it's latexy
A :  It's kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , I dunno . But
B :  Um , mean
C :  A kind of thing that
B :  An uh I if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It's there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to
B :  R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things and and
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , something grippable , I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , so something , m m instead of a necess yeah , grip , I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , you know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time , like I'm imagining that sort of thing , I don't know what th that material's called .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's that seems doable .
B :  could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? We could colour-co-ordinate them , li
A :  F for sure , or maybe like
A :  um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something .
B :  The buttons could be fruit-shaped . Oh well it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot isn't it ? Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits .
A :  Could they be smelly ?
C :  I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something .
D :  Oh God .
A :  I don't know .
A :  Or carrot shaped , mm .
C :  Maybe , or
A :  Like large button , that's what I was thinking of , yeah .
D :  What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . Like in terms of holding it . Like that's a f shape of a fruit . Just to tie it in a little .
C :  Kind of like a potato .
B :  be yeah . It'd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think . It'd be harder to press button .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Might would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it ? 'Cause I think the reason they're long is yeah .
C :  Depends . When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ?
A :  Harder to push .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Or your fingers ?
B :  Um
A :  I usually hold it in one hand . Maybe
C :  Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb .
B :  I
A :  But then the buttons would have to be very small . Don't you think ?
B :  Yeah , that's ts how I tend to do it .
D :  Yeah , 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around . But I like i
B :  No just thumb-sized . Jus
A :  But I mean in order to get to all of them , you know .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other .
C :  Maybe . But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps .
B :  That's true .
B :  Right .
B :  I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . Yeah .
C :  So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb and
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . 'Cause th
C :  And you find that works quite well ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Is that The button on an iPod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ?
D :  It's like five , 'cause there's one in the middle .
A :  It's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel .
B :  It wel well yeah , it would I mean each version of it has been a little bit different , but
A :  The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think .
B :  Oh yeah , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore .
B :  Ts and you press the centre button , that's that's your all-purpose select button right there .
C :  Right .
C :  Oh , I see , right , yeah . Oh , okay . Yeah , that's quite a good design .
B :  Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , yeah .
D :  I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . Like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things , but then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_ , 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ? And then you could still have that available .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh uh t
B :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice .
C :  I think it could be difficult in practice , yeah . Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_ and people don't wanna do that .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
B :  Right .
B :  Um
A :  Okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left , so I'm I'm gonna
B :  Oh we probably have to get going , don't we ?
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  continue with my pres presentation . Um I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all
B :  'Kay .
A :  before we move on . Um
D :  If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know .
B :  Could
B :  Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours , yeah .
C :  Like , to make it different fruits .
C :  Yeah , it's possible .
A :  Yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex wherea but the actual model could be titanium .
B :  Exactly .
B :  And you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever . All these options .
C :  I think maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel . So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control's inside .
B :  Ooh .
D :  Well , there we go . The iPod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun . It's like the way it all comes all cute .
A :  Ah hmm hmm hmm .
B :  Oh .
C :  Don't know .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Options .
D :  Lemons ?
A :  Okay , um components concept . Energy , chip on print .
B :  Uh-hu oh , oh yes . Right , I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get
B :  be necessary but um
A :  That's th th this is the agenda they gave me . So can you just explain what that is real quick ?
B :  Alright , so um decisions , what the okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery . Um I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool .
B :  Am I
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I mean , it would
D :  t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , um I think it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , but as far as I know , the technology is good .
B :  Right , I haven't gotten any yeah , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think .
D :  Costs .
D :  But over time
B :  Um circuit boards .
B :  Um yeah , I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . They're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . I wasn't really given any options , I was just given that this is how they're done .
A :  Okay .
B :  yeah , I can't can't really tell you . I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works . But I don't know any decisions on
A :  If they're if they're really options .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I'm sorry , I did f
C :  Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . Uh it's fairly fairly standard .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Um okay , then we'll move on to the case .
A :  Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe .
B :  Right . Well okay , here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got . Um simple , regular , advanced chip on print . The chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we don't have to worry about that .
B :  Um ,
B :  'kay , the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ?
C :  I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . I mean it might be nice for changing the volume . Uh but
B :  Oh .
A :  It would be nice for changing the volume , but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . 'Cause you don't have control over numbers or
C :  I don't think it would really work .
D :  Yeah , it's a
B :  Yeah , th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll .
C :  Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel .
D :  But if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  We have five minutes left for the meeting , so .
D :  and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . And otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
A :  So , have a scroll for volume ?
B :  F or for all those secret functions ?
B :  When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus .
C :  I think yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . Um
B :  Right . So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later .
A :  Um .
B :  I don't know .
A :  I think w well I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not .
B :  Okay .
B :  Well , let's think about that while we talk about the case .
A :  Okay , let's do case .
B :  Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I'm a little um I'm a little hesitant about it , because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um
D :  Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ?
B :  Uh yeah , everything I've
A :  Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing .
B :  N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . The inside is hard . I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , I think that that's done for us .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Ge o
A :  Okay . So we uh we do want latex .
C :  'Kay . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Latex . Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Fruity colours . Okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose .
B :  Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? Or a double-curved ?
A :  Well , we don't really know what the difference is , right ?
D :  I'm thinking curved of some sort .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay . We don't really know what the difference
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um okay , interface , the type and the supplements .
A :  So push or scroll , right ? Or both ?
C :  Um
C :  Yep . Um
C :  And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons .
B :  Good point .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . I think that yeah . For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno .
C :  Yeah , yeah , it's uh it's it's fairly simple .
B :  Yeah . I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Is that okay with you ? How you feeling ?
C :  Yeah . Interesting .
B :  because
D :  Yeah . And let's like see if we get anything else . I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It might be cool enough .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , and then supplements , how are we gonna do that ?
C :  Yep .
C :  Uh what do you mean by supplements , exactly ?
A :  Um I assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use .
C :  Um
B :  Oh .
A :  So we're gonna have like a menu button , so that we can access on-screen things then ? Okay , um so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through .
C :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Alright .
C :  Um in
B :  So what are what are our buttons gonna be ? On off
C :  Yeah .
C :  On off , uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . Yeah , yeah about yeah like yeah , a bit like radio presets . Um
B :  So like one through five , or
D :  Like a radio type sorta situation ?
A :  Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero , right ?
C :  Uh we wouldn't even need the numbers .
B :  No .
C :  I think maybe numbers seems is kind of old-fashioned .
A :  Well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through .
C :  Yeah , yeah , you can just and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , but the volume control could double for that , for example .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , up down .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay , um finishing the meeting now . Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach .
C :  Cool .
B :  Ooh .
D :  Wow .
A :  Um did we decide on a chip ? Let's go with a simple chip ? Okay .
B :  Simple chip .
C :  Yep .
A :  We are done . Thank you everyone .
A :  Oh I di these are already in our shared folder , so .
B :  Okay , cool .
C :  Clay . I wasn't expecting that .
B :  Clay .
A :  Okay um ,
A :  welcome to our detailed design meeting . I'm pretty excited .
A :  Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that .
A :  Okay um the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . We'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close .
A :  So , starting off with the um last the last one , oh I don't have it here um , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um , we're gonna need a scroll um , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu .
A :  And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels .
A :  Okay ? Let's do the look and feel design presentation first .
C :  Right , do you wanna start ?
B :  Right , well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one .
B :  Um we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . Um it's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand . You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your
B :  index finger of your other hand , or even I mean there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger .
B :  Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big .
B :  We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . If you push if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if uh the volume buttons rather . If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here .
B :  Um if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand .
B :  That's our number one prototype . Um do you wanna present the potato , or shall I present the Martian ?
A :  like a little lightning in it .
C :  Okay , um
A :  The little lightning bolt in it , very cute .
C :  What
C :  We call that one the rhombus , uh the rhombus . Um this one is known as the potato , uh it's
D :  I could
A :  The v the rhombus rhombus ?
B :  That's the rhombus , yep .
C :  it's a how can I present it ? It's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . Um
C :  it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand .
C :  Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . Um
C :  the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here .
C :  Um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected .
C :  Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select
C :  and that's basically it , that's the potato .
A :  Um on , off ?
C :  Uh that would be one of your channels , basically , so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off , yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah we turn it off .
D :  Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ?
C :  Um not really , it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  If you pressed and held it maybe .
C :  Yeah yeah , that that'd be one way of doing it , yeah . That'd work , yeah .
D :  If you like held it down , that would be on off .
B :  Yeah .
B :  On off , that's a possibility , yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way . Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . We have the five preset seeds .
B :  And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle .
B :  So , that's for your consideration as well , plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat .
C :  Let's pass .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Sorry , what's the yellow one in the middle , I forgot .
B :  Uh the menu select button .
A :  Very interesting . I think that one's my favourite .
C :  So that's
C :  So that's our three prototypes . Um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons ,
C :  and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We were we were thinking that
B :  normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down , maybe with with less contrasts on it . Yeah , something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but
A :  Mm 'kay .
C :  Would
C :  Yeah ,
C :  but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy .
B :  yeah .
A :  Now that was one thing that we brought up over email . I don't know if you picked up your email , but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right . Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it .
A :  It's really
A :  Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ?
A :  Do you think that would be conceptually possible ?
C :  I think it would be difficult technologically , because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , s so it's
B :  I think
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  I'm not quite sure how it would work and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . Uh I mean ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ?
A :  That's true , mm 'kay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip
B :  to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , that's a fair evaluation . Getting lost . Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now .
A :  Okay 'cause well , the designs are very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , but um
B :  So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? Um .
D :  I feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . I sort of like this one , like I I don't know why , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , I dunno . But I also like the b the side buttons on that one , like I think that's kind of neat .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on .
A :  Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ?
B :  Mm yeah , that's good , that's good .
C :  Yeah , it's possible , yeah , yeah .
D :  Ah , there we go .
B :  Here , stick it on .
C :  Put an extra the button on .
A :  Sure .
A :  Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ?
D :  Well do we w like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for .
A :  Oh okay . Okay .
D :  That was I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , but let me I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so .
B :  So where
A :  Okay .
A :  Do you need this or just write on the white board ?
D :  No , I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing , 'cause I think it would be redundant .
A :  Okay .
B :  Right .
B :  Okay .
D :  I dunno .
A :  It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , you know , kinda push it .
B :  Ooh .
C :  Cool .
B :  Hey .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Maybe a little smaller than that .
B :  No , I kinda like it . That's hard to miss .
C :  It makes look more fruity as well .
A :  Oh it does , it's kind of like
C :  It's like a deformed foot , I dunno .
B : 
A :  There it could have a stem like that , 'cause I do l kind of like the stem .
B :  Like
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  It almost helps you ge keep a grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Interesting .
A :  I like this one .
B :  Okay , is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? I like the idea of the I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one .
A :  Variety of colours are nice .
A :  I think I'm leaning towards the potato .
A :  Mm-hmm . I am worried about like um using a menu .
A :  Um in that like i withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ?
B :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well that on the iPod , for example , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level .
A :  But that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Good point .
C :  This is , it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . You find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh .
A :  Okay .
A :  Could these be used for going to submenus or
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah .
B :  Maybe yeah , maybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold
A :  Okay .
B :  for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . Well , as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still , mm 'kay .
D :  Okay , so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities , the yellowy one is that
B :  The potato ? Are we leaning towards the potato ?
C :  Potato .
A :  I think so .
D :  Okay , well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one . So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that . So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true
B :  Okay .
D :  and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . So we can do this one first . First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective .
D :  So like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . That's just my opinion .
B :  Yeah .
D :  What does each of you
A :  I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two .
D :  Okay , well give it a number , sorry .
A :  Okay .
A :  I will give it a one .
B :  Um I dunno if it's it's creative . I dunno if fancy is the word I would use .
B :  I dunno if any of them are fancy in I'd say two , because c unique .
D :  Okay .
D :  And two , awesome . Alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? I think it's extremely functional , I'm gonna give it a one .
C :  I'll go for two .
B :  Yeah , one .
D :  One ?
C :  I think it's it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so I'll give it a two .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um functional .
A :  I think it'll get everything done , I think it might be a little confusing at first , um , I don't know if that's gonna be a later one . Okay , then I'm gonna give it a two .
D :  Okay . Well there's some other ones , I will address that , yeah .
D :  Awesome , okay . Um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative .
A :  Did you give a functional ? Okay .
D :  Yeah , she said it was one . Um is it technologically innovative ?
D :  Mm .
D :  Not really , I mean not so much , 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen , we don't have fancy chip . Other than what it looks like , I dunno if it's really
A :  Well , the kinetic battery .
B :  In the battery , that's it .
D :  I kinetic battery is a big one , so .
B :  How many people would notice that , though ?
D :  Mm .
D :  But it but we know it's there .
A :  But they'll notice it after like a year , they'll be like hey , I have never changed the battery .
D :  And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . I'll give it a three .
A :  Mm .
A :  Just the material .
D :  'Cause it we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really
B :  Yeah . I I would say that it's
B :  Yeah , like fancy versus creative it's it's
B :  different . But does that equal innovative ? I dunno . I'll give it a three .
D :  Alright .
D :  Everyone else ?
C :  I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , I mean it's it's just it is just pushbuttons um , so I I'd give it a four .
A :  Think I'm gonna go with the four as well .
D :  Mm 'kay .
A :  I really like that kinetic battery though .
D :  Next , is it easy to use ? Just so you know , easy to learn will be separate , so don't overlap them . I think it's really easy to use . I'll give it a two .
A :  Mm 'kay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Um I'll give it a one . Pretty hard to mess up .
C :  I'll say one .
A :  Uh let's say two .
D :  Alright . Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I it's spongy all the way .
A :  Give it a one .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  I wonder if it bounces when you drop it .
B :  Ooh , that you couldn't it'd be harder to break , harder to lose .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm . 'Cause there would be less impact maybe , .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Iain , what do you give it ?
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah I'd I'd give it a one .
D :  Alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? Well , is it gonna be yellow ?
C :  Uh um .
B :  It it might be , 'cause that's our corporate colour , isn't it ?
A :  That's right , yeah , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in um well if we I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity .
C :  Yeah .
B :  We might wanna keep it yellow .
D :  Yeah , but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah ,
A :  Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? Okay .
B :  If we had a yellow
B :  Sure .
D :  Oh , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright , so I think it it's
A :  Fruity , so fruity .
B :  So it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think i it's kind of mangoey too .
D :  Yeah . I okay , I'm giving it a one the mango put me over .
C :  Mangoey is better , yeah . I like mangoes .
B :  Oh , mango that that
A :  Yes .
A :  Mm .
B :  That's a much more trendy than a potato one .
D :  What are what's everyone's numbers ?
C :  Uh two .
A :  One .
D :  Alright um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most .
D :  I think we really took that into account a lot , so I'm gonna give it a one .
B :  Yeah , me too .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh one .
D :  Did you say one , Rose ?
A :  Yes .
D :  Okay um , also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing . Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ?
D :  I think I'll give it a two , 'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen .
A :  It's gonna be hard .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , but um
D :  Um um worth the risk , I think .
A :  I like how it fits in the hand though so I I'd go with a two .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I'll I'll say two as well . Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , but
A :  Mm .
D :  'Kay .
C :  Yeah I'll I'll say two .
D :  Alright , awesome . And the ease of learning it . I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that , I dunno . It sort of reminds me of the iPod . I just got mine , I still haven't read the instruction book and I'm doing okay , so and I'm not good at learning technology . So I'll give it a two .
A :  Mm .
B :  The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first , but
B :  Oh , good point .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  once you've , yeah once you'd learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier . So I'd I'd give it a four .
D :  Okay .
A :  I think I'd give it a four too . It's a pretty high learning curve , it'll be easy once you've done it , but
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright , um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all , so
A :  We we I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , but
D :  Okay , so in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four , 'cause I think that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it , you're kind of not gonna find it , but anywhere else it's gonna stand out .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Um I'd say I'd give it uh a three , I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally .
A :  Mm I'd give it a four .
C :  Um I'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah .
A :  Small too .
D :  Alright , we also said simplicity , how w how well does it address just being simple ?
B :  Simple to use or simple in design ? Do you know ?
D :  I think overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , so those are the next two things we're gonna look at . Separate from fancy , like that sort of thing .
B :  Right .
D :  Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple , so I'm gonna give it a two .
B :  I'm give it a three I guess .
C :  I'll give it a two .
A :  Three .
D :  Alright , and fashionable ?
A :  It's totally fashionable . I'd give it a one .
D :  It's hot , I mean it's a mango , come on .
A :  Mango .
D :  I mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well .
B :  I dunno . I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote
A :  I do like uh the little Martian one .
B :  or alien or whatever he was .
D :  Yeah , the toggle on off switch , it's really appealing .
D :  Number .
B :  Um two .
C :  Three .
A :  One .
D :  And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal ,
D :  that whole thing ?
D :  Just that it would se serve our audience .
D :  I don't see why not .
A :  Mm-hmm . I think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements .
A :  Um yeah , that's good .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So I'll give it a a two .
B :  Yeah , I'll say two .
D :  Alright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ?
A :  Well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it . All of them should have R_R_ , yeah .
B :  Shall we uh
B :  Well I think all of them should have an R_R_ .
D :  And so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , fine .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay .
D :  Okay .
D :  That's me .
A :  Lovely .
A :  Okay , now we're gonna look at finances . Um I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um ,
A :  so let me exit out of this first .
A :  Okay um
B :  Oh my .
D :  Whoa .
A :  I know .
A :  Let me one more space . Gonna zoom in real quick .
A :  Okay . Hand dynamo .
A :  We're using kinetic battery , right ?
B :  Uh we're n using kinetic , yeah .
A :  Um and we're having one per
B :  Yeah .
A :  One , okay . Um electronics .
B :  Single . Simple , simple rather .
A :  Simple .
D :  Simple .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Um the case .
B :  Uh uh uh double-curved .
C :  Guess it's double-curved . It is pretty curvy .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It's very curvy , so okay .
B :  Yeah I never did get a picture of those so I don't really know .
B :  Our case material supplements oops , we just skipped by them . No , we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . The supplement is
D :  Well don't we need plastic , and
D :  Provided , okay .
A :  The wood ?
B :  Oh , I guess it was rubber rather than latex .
A :  I mean the rubber .
D :  It was rubber and special colour , right ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm , okay .
D :  Do we have more than one special colour ?
B :  Uh well
A :  Yeah , we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours .
C :  Special colours , isn't it ?
A :  Um .
B :  I don't know what the se the basic colour is though .
D :  Per
A :  I dunno where it yeah .
D :  Well , but we know that we're having at least three colours , so
A :  So let's y say three .
B :  Well , are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , you know , we'll like we'll have yellow and black . Is that two special colours ?
A :  Yeah , I dunno . That I thi I thought that would be under yours .
B :  Or or is white and black , then two more or
B :  Uh .
B :  I guess it's three , three three .
A :  We'll just say three .
A :  Mm-hmm . Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well , so yeah . Interface , we're doing push buttons . And how many buttons do we have ?
D :  Right .
B :  Alright .
B :  Yeah .
D :  We have six .
C :  We've got five . Oh six .
B :  Six , with the power .
A :  Six .
D :  Oh no , five .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Anything else ?
B :  No . Oh , we'll do we wa
B :  Are the buttons in special colour , special f
B :  I didn't get information on
D :  Oh wait .
A :  Oh , buttons oh , so um . So the case material will just have one colour , right , but then the buttons will be in special colours ?
B :  Well , does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where I'm getting confused .
D :  Yeah .
A :  We're saying per unit .
B :  per unit , okay , okay .
D :  Yeah , per unit .
A :  Okay , so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is
B :  Alright , and each button s
A :  could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
D :  I like it like that .
A :  Special form ? They're all kind of just push button , right ?
B :  No , I think they're fine . Material , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Special material ?
A :  Uh . Oh do I have to do it per button , do I ?
B :  No , I don't think so .
B :  I think they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise , 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one . It's I mean it's two to make it rubber . Oh wait , so maybe .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Thirteen point seven .
B :  Oh oh .
A :  Yeah , what can we reduce ?
B :  Okay , let's have our buttons all be one colour .
D :  Mm , I kind of like the buttons .
A :  Let's see what that would do . It's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway .
B :  Alright .
A :  Okay um , are we sure this is double-curved ? Maybe it's single-curved , we have no idea .
B :  Uh .
B :  We have no idea .
B :  I dunno , I didn't get any pictures .
B :  It's single curved . Why not ?
D :  It's single curved .
A :  Well it's not the yeah . Okay , it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive , but we have a simple chip , single curve ,
A :  case material is rubber and it's a special colour , but that's important . Six buttons we have to have six buttons .
B :  Yeah .
B :  That is important . How did it get more expensive , what did you just change ? It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen .
A :  What ?
A :  No , okay , maybe not . I don't know what just happened . Now it's twelve .
C :  What was our target price again ?
B :  Twelve point five . Hey hey .
A :  Twelve point five .
C :  Twelve point five . So we're just just about there .
A :  So we're okay , I think .
B :  We're all set then .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Ish .
A :  Okay , we're all set . Um save . I saved that to our um our big shared folder , so you know . Um okay , back to agenda .
B :  Alright .
A :  Um are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ? Yes . Let's move on to the project evaluation .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , they are .
A :  Project process .
A :  Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , um how how well I guess I led it , um the how well we worked together as a team , um the digital pens , the whiteboard .
B :  Well .
A :  Okay .
B :  I felt very creative . I enjoyed making the prototypes .
C :  I think we've been successful in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got cost .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , like what's a single-curved case , how many colours , what do colours count
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  things , but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well .
B :  Um I think we worked together pretty well .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I mean if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could've taken that into account .
B :  Yeah . But the fruits and vegetables , they really my creativity , so .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I know , I really did , the the whole mango idea was great . No , I mean
B :  Do you think we could
D :  I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , I dunno . That was a bit of a distraction . That was the last one , like I chose not to do a PowerPoint 'cause I didn't think it made sense to , so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I think we all made um very significant contributions , I don't think anybody dominated it , which I thought was really good , like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and I uh I tried to facilitate it without like taking over , um
B :  Yeah .
A :  I like our little finished products .
B :  Can we market this as the mango remote ? Should we have that somewhere on the packaging ?
D :  They're funny .
A :  Really cute .
D :  I kind of want one .
B :  I have a little R_R_ .
D :  I'm trying to think of a good pun that I could add there .
A :  I know , let's think of it like a little jingle .
A :  Um .
D :  I like the R_R_ , that's gonna be etched in .
B :  Yes . Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it's quite a useful little gadget .
B :  All thanks to Iain for the design of that one .
A :  .
A :  Okay um new ideas found ?
B :  Mm . What did we find for new ideas ? People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables .
A :  Definitely . Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm
C :  Yeah .
B :  I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . That was
A :  etcetera .
A :  Oh , I'm so excited .
D :  Yeah , I didn't even know they existed .
B :  I I knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery , 'cause you're always moving your wrist .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But in other things , I think it'd be really good .
A :  I thi yeah , that's awesome .
A :  Um okay , closing .
A :  Are the costs within the budget ? Is the project evaluated ? Now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . Um so , this is the great product kids , I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope um
B :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
A :  yeah . Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of
A :  both the process and the um the final results and . I do like the Martian remote . If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice .
D :  Yeah , Real Reaction .
D :  Oh , that would definitely be my second choice .
C :  Mm .
A :  Although the tog toggle
A :  I'm afraid I would
C :  That's cool . Let's all let's all go for the yellow
D :  I would break it . I would break it .
A :  It's cool . I think I would break it .
B :  It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem and then alright , so
C :  Break the stem off .
D :  Oh that's funny .
B :  Is it started as a pear , but then it started looking more and more like a Martian when I put the
D :  Kind of looks like a penguin , like with no eye .
A :  Oh yeah , it's kind of a penguin .
B :  Take me to your leader .
D :  I like that it stands up .
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  Wow , maybe I should market it to some remote control company now .
B :  So are are poor little thing .
C :  That was bound to happen
D :  Oh , sad .
A :  Mm 'kay , congratulations .
A :  Um .
A :  Anything else to say ?
D :  Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , its all timed .
A :  Alright .
B :  Oh .
A :  Um anybody have I got more master classes , anybody else wanna like take a master's class ?
D :  Oh .
B :  It's really funny that you got spam in your work emails .
A :  Yeah , but check it out . So like there are all these like links , they don't go anywhere .
A :  But all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management . Um just wanna make sure you do .
D :  No the first one that you sent like I didn't realise that it was a joke and I was like why did she send this to us ? It's very it's very work relevant , 'cause people send spam a lot .
A :  Oh
A :  It is .
A :  Yes definitely I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website .
B :  Let's see , what did I get through the corporate website ? It's just inspiration about circuit boards .
D :  Oh here you can you can view .
A :  .
D :  You can just see what's up .
A :  Wow .
D :  Yeah it's it's really deep . Hold on .
D :  Takes a little while to get excited to load . That the Excel thing is pretty cool . Here , like , basically it's like inspiration , basically I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and
A :  Yes . I love Excel , it's one of my favourite programs .
B :  Yeah , that is pretty neat .
D :  that kind of thing , see . You didn't miss out that much .
A :  I see , mm .
B :  Yeah , my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards . I learned a lot actually . I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to .
A :  Spongy .
C :  Mm .
D :  Oh wow .
D :  This one was cooler . I got a whole table and everything .
B :  Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and I wrote it all down , because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they're like , you don't actually need this you just need to talk about the case .
D :  That's like mine it was like , would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control ? And then it didn't have like any kind of table , like awesome , I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result .
B :  It's really interesting though .
A :  I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  We had a lot of the um otherwise the technology today was kinda cool .
C :  I think .
B :  That was really neat how I got emails and
C :  Yeah .
C :  We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  No .
A :  No . Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me I
B :  I yeah . If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , I would have probably drawn them up , but
A :  Mm .
D :  'Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period .
B :  Yeah , we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , but with only four people it doesn't really make sense . I think if you had a larger group
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But I thought we were good orally .
D :  Get crazy .
A :  And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint as that's not as necessary to have .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to
D :  like write up them here , 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Because we're all gonna be working in different places . We if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright , but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , I guess .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Now when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ?
C :  Uh we we worked together , um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , um and how we could like improve on the on the design .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  So it was a bit of both really , we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and
B :  just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Cool .
B :  It was fun .
B :  So well done with the management , I felt well managed .
A :  Oh thanks .
C :  I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time , and second we actually
A :  It's kinda fun .
C :  we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings .
A :  Mm .
D :  Sorry .
C :  And I
B :  That happened to me all the time though .
C :  I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions , but we were able to do it regardless , so .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I'm not usually a very decisive person , so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes .
A :  This is what we'll do .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes
A :  sometimes in the meetings .
C :  Yeah , for some of the meetings , yeah .
B :  Especially last time , yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , you know what I mean , like we we couldn't answer every single question .
B :  Yeah ,
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
A :  Um but
B :  And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information , and not sort of
A :  Mm .
B :  made me really like , ooh I don't know , throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite . I had so much information and so much to talk about .
A :  It was interesting what came out like later , like as I was doing the when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um , that more points came out from your presentation even .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Um .
A :  I'm a little I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a um something for losing the remote , because that was kind of a big point .
B :  Yeah .
B :  that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like
A :  About yeah .
D :  Well the problem was , even when we just were creating from the Excel file , there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included , so there was no we could be like yeah , it has it included . There was no way for us to have
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think we were
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Considered the re yeah .
D :  written down that it was really there .
B :  I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task . I think we really got into it , I mean I got into it as the day went on and I got really like , ooh I'm designing a remote control , I dunno if that's just me , but
A :  Well it's interesting that they
A :  Mm-hmm , yeah . It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um we weren't provided with information to discuss that .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep , but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology that
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I just don't know what it is , but
B :  I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things
B :  so you won't lose them .
A :  Mm .
B :  I dunno . I mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there's only one T_V_ and
A :  Hmm .
B :  there's only like three chairs .
D :  That's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys , and I always do , anyway .
D :  You'll lose 'em in your pocket , like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , there's always ways to lose things .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  It d yeah , it depends on how organised you are personally , but
B :  Yeah , or like I guess what the setup of the house is too .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But , I mean
B :  I am notorious for losing my keys , I just I guess I've just never lost the remote . I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldn't find them . 'Cause I was putting groceries away .
D :  That's funny .
A :  Oh .
B :  You you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room .
A :  Can't get in .
B :  Can't get in , look all around the kitchen .
B :  Definitely in the vegetable drawer .
D :  That's funny .
B :  So .
D :  I always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using a different coat .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
B :  But I guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Can't really take it into the other room .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located
B :  Oh a G_P_S_ system , internal G_P_S_ .
D :  Oh man .
D :  Here you go .
A :  We should make one that walks by itself .
B :  Although if it's sitting still for too long .
B :  Yes I
D :  That really could get up and walk away .
B : 
A :  Or or like some crazy like electro-magnet , that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there .
B :  Or little
B :  Or just just a wheel , you know .
B :  Just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote , that'll .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Well , but if you could attach them to the T_V_ , then you can .
B :  zoom
B :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
B :  All kinds of possibilities .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Sorry , I'm just um trying to update my minutes . I decided to you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them . Just gonna make I'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that . 'Cause that seems a little more useful .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Oh .
B :  Wow .
B :  'Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do .
A :  But I didn't have like information to sloth through either , so
B :  Yeah , I guess
B :  How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you , every meeting .
A :  Most of it , mm-hmm . I added slides , um I added a couple slides each time , but that was about it .
B :  Oh .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , I didn't even think about adding slides , 'cause I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more .
A :  Mm .
A :  Well , the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points , but it wouldn't have a slide for each point . And that's the only way I remember that I need to go other that point . I know personally when I do PowerPoint , that's what I do and so I had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and I would do your three .
B :  Ah yeah. .
B :  Right .
D :  You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like
A :  The slogan on it ? No no no .
B :  No , no , definitely not .
D :  Okay good .
B :  We
D :  'Cause I was like , it could go around the outside .
B :  No , I don't think we need to I think the R_ and R_ , especially if the yellow and black one .
A :  I think we just need the um the R_R_ , yeah .
D :  Is it yellow and blue ?
B :  Or yellow and blue . Lemme go to the web page .
A :  Yeah , I was just kinda going by the web page , 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or .
D :  Oh I guess it is black , grey . Grey is better than black , doesn't look so bumblebeeish .
A :  I don't really like yellow in general .
D :  Hey now I understand the random like newsclippings .
A :  But it
B :  Finish meeting now .
A :  Wasn't it interesting that um I thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um
D :  Yes .
A :  the marketing choices , you know , like that was a bit of a conflict .
D :  I will I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , it's kind of an they were so not backed up , it would just be a sentence like we did a survey , this is what people said .
D :  S mm , I dunno .
B :  Yeah .
A :  People are stupid .
B :  I guess it i it sort of a grey , isn't it ? Yellow and grey , but then the slogan's in blue .
D :  Well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons , we're good .
B :  Yeah . Well we don't have the right colour clay anyway .
A :  Maybe , like I don't know . That could always be .
B :  Well we're not , sadly , going to actually be producing this , so .
A :  Oh .
D :  If they ever come out with potato
B :  Potato mango shaped remotes .
D :  I'm gonna have to
A :  I'm claiming it intellectual property .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I can't believe a whole day is gone . I don't feel like it's been that long .
D :  I know .
B :  Get sucked in .
B :  Mm I haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet .
