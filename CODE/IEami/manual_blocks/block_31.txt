D :  Hello .
D :  Dang it .
A :  And then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot .
D :  Alright .
A :  It's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here .
B :  Okay .
B :  No , that's okay .
B :  Joost , your mouse .
D :  What ?
B :  No mouse needed ?
D :  I've got a touch-pad . Do you know how how I can wake it up ?
B :  Mm .
B :  A touch-pad ?
D :  No , my laptop .
B :  Slap it .
D :  You with your brilliant ideas . I don't know if I can touch the power button .
D :  Do you know how how I can wake it up ?
B :  Is
A :  No . Yeah . Try the power button .
D :  Oh .
D :  Come on , move it .
B :  Um
D :  Now , wake up , bitch .
A :  Huh .
B :  F_ five .
B :  F_ five .
C :  I've lost my screen . Uh
D :  Yeah , so did I . I closed it . That wasn that wasn't very smart , I guess . Come on . Get back to me .
B :  I don't .
D :  Yes .
C :  Yes .
C :  I closed the
D :  I closed it .
B :  You've got your name .
A :  Yeah , my name is name .
D :  No , I didn't restart it , I just closed it .
D :  Yes .
B :  Hope it working .
D :  Alright .
C :  No .
B :  Never close your laptop .
A :  Yeah ? Everybody's ready ? Great . Well , welcome to the kick-off meeting . I uh forgot to put my name over here , it's uh it's Martin .
D :  Great . Thanks .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh , so you all know .
A :  Well , this is the agenda for today . Well , the opening is what I'm doing right now . Uh , we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things . Uh give some um
A :  examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . We have twenty five minutes .
A :  Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control . Uh , some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  So now we all know what our
A :  goal is . Um , I oh forget I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other . We all know each other's names . Joost , Guido , Antek .
D :  Yes .
B :  What is your name ?
C :  Yes . Antek .
B :  Antek Ahmet . And Joost .
A :  Okay . I think we uh al already uh been through that part . Okay , it consists of uh three levels of design . Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions , and uh you p you probably read that already , so I don't have to tell you about that .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
A :  Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . You can uh um there's a document folder called um the sh shared document folder . You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . We also have the white-board . Uh , we're gonna skip through th
B :  Can we see the white-board on our laptops ? No , I saw I saw the file , the smart-board that X_B_K_ but
A :  No , no . Just on the on the screen over there .
A :  Oh , no . Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop . Is is if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's I don't know if it's important .
B :  Okay .
A :  This an explanation of the smart-boards . There is a tool-bar over here .
A :  It's quite simple . You have the the pen function , eraser function . It's like a very simple uh paint application . Uh , we well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . It works like this .
A :  Oh . If pen is selected , yes . Oh , no no .
B :  With that pen ?
A :  It's not
A :  But it is pen .
A :  It's not working like a pen yet .
B :  Mm .
A :  Huh .
A :  Huh .
B :  Mm .
A :  It's doing some stuff now . So you can use a pen . You can use an eraser .
B :  Little bit slower .
A :  And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format .
A :  And then select current colour or line width .
A :  So , it's quite easy .
A :  Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools .
A :  Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . Uh , I'll start off then . I'll use this uh same sheet . Alright .
A :  Oh , let me think .
A :  Different colours .
A :  Oh .
A :  Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish .
B :  piranha . Okay .
A :  Uh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh .
A :  I'm gonna use some different colour now . Some a little white .
A :  Looks like a fish .
A :  Think it is .
A :  Oh .
A :  Oh .
A :  Uh , colour .
A :  This is black ?
A :  I think so .
B :  Yellow
A :  Oh .
A :  Oh , this is just uh
A :  useless uh
A :  drawings but Oh teeth . I need teeth .
A :  Well , they're not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  What was uh I have su to sum up its favourite characteris Well , I like its uh sharp razor sharp teeth . Plus , uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh , well a small actual face . And I like its overall uh aggressive look and
B :  Different .
A :  Well , that's what I like about uh piranha . I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be .
B :  Okay .
A :  Well , who wants to be next ?
D :  Nobody , I guess .
B :  I will try . Yeah . I will try . Uh
A :  You go , Guido ? Okay .
A :  Uh , make a new sheet . Uh , it's by pressing on blank . Yep .
B :  Blank ?
B :  Okay . Then pen again ?
A :  Yep .
B :  Okay .
A :  And uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths .
B :  Okay , um
D :  Format .
B :  control .
B :  Uh
B :  Ah , purple .
B :  Um , I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is , but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird . Uh I will
D :  You know , I thought of that actually . Yeah .
B :  That's my bird . Yeah ? Isn't it quite it's a little bit light .
B :  Uh , another colour maybe . A red one .
B :  A small one . Uh , line width .
B :  Two ? Three . Oh that's okay .
B :  That's another one . Ano Uh uh it's a Yeah , it's uh the most simple uh animal I know , I think . Um , I don't know . Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that . Maybe a little bit . Yeah . I don't know .
A :  Well , tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds .
D :  Its simplicity .
A :  Oh , okay . Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  No , uh it's clear .
B :  So more uh birds ? Okay , okay , okay .
A :  N no no .
A :  We get your point . Okay . Who wants to be next ?
D :  Yeah , whatever . I'll go next . Thanks . I haven't got a favourite animal too , so
B :  Pictionary .
D :  Oh . What should I draw ?
B :  A cow .
A :  Oh .
D :  Thank you , I'll draw a penguin .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I'll draw a penguin . Whatever .
D :  I can't draw , so
D :  you can start to laugh already .
A :  I'll do so .
D :  Whatever . Something like that .
D :  Come on .
B :  Yeah , it's little bit hard .
D :  Mm hmm hmm , orange .
B :  Orange , of course .
D :  Whatever .
D :  Oh , it's better than your bird .
B :  Uh yeah . Yeah . True .
D :  Everything's better than your bird .
D :  Whatever . Hey , it's blue . No . Whatever . Um , I like its ugliness and uh Yeah , whatever . The way it walks or whatever . Your turn .
A :  Okay .
C :  'Kay .
D :  Drawing .
C :  I'm going to draw a cat .
C :  I don't know why , but a cat is a very uh smart animal .
C :  And you can have them at home .
C :  Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and
A :  Well , you can have a piranha at home .
C :  Ye yes , yeah .
A :  Huh .
D :  Or a line .
B :  A little bit . Yeah .
D :  I mean a bird .
B :  Don't mess with my birds , yeah .
C :  It's not very uh
C :  very good drawn , but you can see a cat from it .
D :  Hmm . It's a handicapped cat .
B :  cat .
A :  I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that .
C :  It's
C :  Ah , it's not scared . He's crying but
A :  .
D :  He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness .
A :  Okay .
A :  What do you like about it then ?
C :  Uh it's i most cats are small . You can handle them .
A :  Oh , okay . Okay . Okay . Okay , and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess .
B :  Okay .
D :  I wouldn't call it training , but
A :  Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . We're very ambitious on this one . The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . So that's clear . Yeah ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Alright .
A :  Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . Do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls ? Or do they annoy you sometimes ? Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ?
C :  Yes .
B :  Hmm .
D :  I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with
A :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Different .
A :  Okay .
D :  uh grouped buttons , you know . All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh
A :  Different functions of of uh
D :  Well , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this or whatever o o other functions totally somewhere else . I think we should group them . And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? Uh
D :  Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . It's what , from my experience .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But isn't it
D :  I don't know . Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television .
A :  Okay .
A :  But we gonna
B :  It's only for television , I thought . Not
D :  Yes .
A :  Oh , it is only for televis
B :  I thought it was only for television . So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ .
D :  Yes , it is only for television , but uh
A :  So wha what
D :  Well
A :  What wha what uh what document
D :  well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . If we think it's useful , we do it .
A :  But , where where did it uh Where did you find that ?
B :  Uh , in the email . I thought it said uh Yeah , television remote control .
A :  Oh , okay .
D :  That's right . It's a television remote control . But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_
C :  Yes ,
A :  Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . So we can No , we have to think about that . Okay , uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or
C :  Yes , that's uh something extras .
B :  True . Yeah .
B :  True .
D :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , also no one's gonna buy it .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I guess .
C :  Only the experts .
B :  True .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . That w Well , then you're you're the usability uh man , so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then .
B :  Oh my God .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Well , other ideas ? How can we make it trendy or something ? Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ?
C :  Uh , to go with to go with fashion and
A :  Maybe a can opener underneath it ? I don't know . Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably .
B :  For the bear . Uh
B :  I I uh , no I think it
D :  Yeah , way too high .
B :  Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . It's international , so we have to use a standard .
D :  Yep .
A :  Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh Well , m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it We gonna skip back to the goals probably . Uh ,
D :  Well that's an idea of course , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  original , trendly , and user-friendly Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . No , well something trendy and original , well that that goes hand in hand I guess . When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , or we should make it combination of that .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay , so you the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it .
B :  Use friendly .
B :  Yep .
A :  Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . Well , you know , y like some special feature . Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yes , what the market wishes .
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , the closing . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Individual , I think so . The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh
A :  Already s said that . The User Interface Designer is it a User Inter User Interface the technical functions design . And the Management Expert of uh the Marketing Expert . User requirements specifi Well , this one was already clear to us . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . I don't know how much time we have left . Oh , not many I guess . We started at twelve .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Interface d
D :  Yeah .
D :  You just got a message .
A :  Oh , and what does it said ?
D :  And it said uh five minutes , so we got four and a half .
B :  Oh , I don't
A :  Okay , well um
B :  I didn't get a message .
D :  No .
D :  He's the whatever .
B :  Oh , the Project Manager .
C :  Team Leader .
A :  No , we're uh ahead of schedule then .
D :  Team Leader .
D :  He is the whatever .
A :  Yeah , close it .
B :  Okay .
A :  I'm gonna make some minutes or take some minutes .
D :  Yes .
A :  And uh it's it's clear you can put the stuff in the project documents presentations . You can all Or we're all uh
B :  Okay .
D :  Project joc project documents is for showing uh on the white-board . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , but we're all familiar with uh uh Microsoft PowerPoint , are we ? Yeah , okay . I'm gonna wri uh write some stuff down and then we're ready .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Alright .
D :  Okay .
A :  Or we can leave already I guess . or uh or sh or should we uh or is important that we leave at exact uh
D :  Yeah .
C :  No .
D :  No . I don't think so . Yes ? Great .
A :  Okay .
B :  I don't think Oh
A :  Yes .
C :  Oh .
A :  We'll see each other in uh thirty minutes .
D :  Yeah . Good luck .
A :  Yeah , good luck .
B :  I will need it .
D :  I will need it .
B :  Here we go again .
C :  My mouse is not working anymore . He's uh when I put it in , is is going to beep beep beep .
B :  Oh .
D :  Oh .
B :  Okay .
D :  Oh , I got a nice little screen here over here .
D :  I got like this big black border uh on every side .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm , okay .
D :  I'll I'll fix it . Yeah , whatever .
A :  Everybody ready ?
B :  Yeah , it's okay .
A :  Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten .
A :  Uh this is the agenda , the opening . Uh , we've got three presentations . And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions . We have uh forty minutes .
D :  Yes .
A :  Oh , well this is the the closing already . So uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then .
A :  Uh , I think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order . Maybe the
B :  Okay .
D :  I don't know what the right order is . So
B :  No .
A :  Well , it
C :  Huh .
A :  Oh that . It won't doesn't Maybe we should start with the the technical functions .
C :  Okay , how can I get this on the whiteboard ?
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder . You've already done that ?
B :  In project .
C :  Okay , I've done that .
B :  No can that open .
C :  Yes .
A :  Well let's close this one . We'll just uh open a new one .
B :  Open it there .
A :  Uh , well . Yes .
A :  Uh-oh . New thing .
A :  Oh yeah , uh I have to say something . Uh , due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
B :  About the get
A :  And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too .
C :  'Kay , we're going to um
C :  uh talk about working design . Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . It's an electrical circuit
C :  which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television .
C :  Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology .
C :  Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . Uh , it's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . And and the components are very uh very cheap . Um ,
C :  Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . Uh , again , it's a fair price . It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh
C :  um part of the remote control . Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it's it is uh
C :  can be made as fast as printing paper . It's uh it's all very uh
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , they're making it uh all the time . Uh ,
A :  Okay .
C :  and it's not uh very specialised uh technology .
C :  I haven't come to here , but
C :  um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh
C :  just a remote control like everyone knows . So I don't know uh why I should put it here .
C :  Uh
A :  Okay . But it's the technical side of the remote control .
C :  Yes , but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time . But
A :  Oh .
A :  Okay . Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then .
C :  What ?
B :  Okay .
A :  But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? It's gonna be easy ?
C :  No .
C :  Yes .
A :  Okay .
B :  But nothing restricted for user interface ?
A :  Yeah . M
B :  With technical
C :  Um , no , it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah .
B :  I don't know .
A :  Okay .
B :  'Kay .
C :  Remote control is nothing special nowadays .
A :  R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . Doesn't really matter .
B :  Okay .
C :  Um
B :  But I kind of uh
C :  I don't think so , because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ?
A :  Okay . Yeah , okay .
B :  Yes .
B :  Uh
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , we'll see . We'll see later on .
B :  Well , the technical functions . Um , well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got , but uh I got these two , and I think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user .
A :  No .
C :  No .
B :  th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements , I don't s uh know who's doing t
A :  Well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? The ones I I've uh received from the account manager . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but it I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control .
A :  Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on .
B :  Yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v Yeah ? Well , what that's what you want trying to say .
D :  Yes , I agree . Yeah .
B :  Well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user . But I don't know . It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , well some of these Uh , yeah .
A :  Well , some of that will Yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements .
B :  Yeah , probably , yeah .
D :  Yes .
A :  So
B :  Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . I think that's just basic what we need . And from that on we can user requirements what we need more .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Uh
B :  Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that .
D :  Yes .
D :  I haven't really found a conclusion like that .
B :  M you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that . I don't know . Uh , I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh yeah , more trendier design , I think . I think .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Design .
D :  Sounds interesting .
B :  Yeah ?
B :  Uh , well , that's all I have to say , I think .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , that was it .
D :  Alright .
A :  Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market .
D :  Yes .
B :  .
D :  Yeah . It's alright . Um
D :  Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . Um yes .
D :  The working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh
D :  how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . Uh , I've lined them up here . Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . I uh have found some interesting things . We do we do got a market . Um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach .
D :  Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . That's quite a lot . Um ,
D :  relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour . Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . Furthermore , fifty percent says
D :  uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . That doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . But
D :  it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls .
D :  So , what I was thinking oh , wrong side . We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used ,
D :  we could group them uh on one button
D :  and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say ,
D :  we can spare at buttons over there . And um , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too uh
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Small buttons , so they won't be very um , how do you say
A :  Visually presents .
D :  Yes , won't be very present , thank you . And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent .
D :  That was kind of what I found .
A :  Okay . Well , then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important . Uh , well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , I think .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yes .
A :  Because um
A :  uh s decided to put They have decide to put two additional requirements forward .
A :  Well , now I see four . That's kinda strange .
D :  Two ?
A :  Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . It's impossible , I think . So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . So we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely .
B :  Well
D :  No uh , I agree , I agree .
B :  No way .
D :  Not too much , no .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  I don't know . I think that uh
A :  that's what they're trying to say . Uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I don't really agree actually , to be honest . It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . It's only like thirty percent of the total market . Mayb yeah ?
A :  Yeah , but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group . That's the one we haven't covered yet . So I think that's
A :  what the problem is . We haven't got remote controls for uh Well I think , yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . Not too much then , bu alright .
A :  Yeah , I think so . Maybe if it's no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . So maybe we can
A :  make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay , something else nice to know .
D :  Yes .
B :  But what's our slogan ?
A :  Sorry ? Yeah , you will have to look that up .
B :  The slogan uh
D :  Yeah , I'll have a look .
D :  We put the fashion in electronics .
A :  I think it's something about the Oh , okay . I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but
B :  Puts fashion in electronics .
B :  Sense simplicity .
D :  Sense and simplicity .
A :  Okay well , let's go back to the
A :  the agenda .
A :  So we've now had to the three presentations . We know about the new project requirements .
A :  That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . Well , if I can uh make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . I think we're we're looking for some Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . Y well , that
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very uh yeah , we don't really need to have a simple remote control . I think we can implement more functions then , because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but wha
A :  Yeah , yeah . M yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger Well , ma
B :  But
D :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used . So why should j we put this function in ? I think more I think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well , I think
A :  But I think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have
A :  Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . You can uh , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . We don't want that . I think that was that became clear . We don't want . But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to ,
D :  Yes .
A :  you know , they want to uh
D :  Yeah , control .
B :  Yeah , but uh you said Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making .
A :  control , remotely .
A :  No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to But maybe w Yeah . I think we maybe should
B :  It's n
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it . But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind , or n what d what do you guys think ?
C :  But you can put them under the same button .
D :  Not much more than that .
A :  Yeah , if as far as possible .
D :  Yep .
D :  Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever .
D :  So t
A :  But what do you think ? Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices ? No , you don't think so ? Yeah , the new requirements say so .
B :  No .
B :  No , new requirements say no .
B :  So
C :  But you can put a play and stop and and rewind .
A :  Well , maybe it's maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . You know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but
C :  Yes , but we
D :  Y yes .
B :  I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th th with lot more functions .
A :  Yep , exactly .
A :  That's that's wha
D :  But but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever , just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward .
A :  No no , you don't No no , you don't need it . No , no .
B :  No , no . Exactly .
C :  Huh .
A :  Okay , but we have to think uh w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh , I guess , so um but uh from my experience it's kinda a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . Uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . It's c sometimes a bit difficult . Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then .
D :  Yeah , I know , but uh
B :  Mm , yeah .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , but just
B :  keep it simple and look more at th
A :  And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote . Okay . It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more .
B :  No .
B :  It's only for television . So
C :  Yes , but there are there are
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , nothing more . Exactly .
A :  Okay .
D :  Alright .
A :  Um , but what televis
C :  But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? There are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have
A :  Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . And simple . Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . So we should put uh zap buttons on it . Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels .
B :  Yeah . The user interface is easy .
B :  And the basic yeah , basic functions , yeah .
D :  Yes , definitely , yeah .
A :  Uh ,
B :  It's too much integrated in the other .
A :  Okay , a t a teletext button should be there . But just one big teletext button , on and off .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Probably .
D :  Yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not nothing more than that . I think stop function is very useful . If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader ,
A :  Oh , okay .
D :  then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but
A :  Yeah , but uh I think that becomes too difficult , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then .
D :  Well , I use it very regularly , the action . I re I use it quite often .
A :  Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And
B :  Will you look
A :  we have to well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . Yeah . I don't know . I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote . I don't know what you th guys think .
B :  Look at the market .
B :  Well
D :  Might be . Might be .
B :  Yeah , I uh , it's Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah , for the soccer uh
A :  Yeah , but do you like to have a such a s stop button ? Or do you think it uh
A :  I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function .
B :  Well , uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , it goes Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . That's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements .
C :  Yes , but you could put
B :  Yeah , but
C :  on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . If you have seven pages , you can go up and down .
A :  Well yeah uh , lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it . Then we meet uh the new requirements .
C :  Yes .
B :  True .
A :  we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess .
B :  A simple yeah .
A :  Okay . Um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ?
A :  Or do we uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want .
A :  We have the zap and uh the volume . Should we do m make them very big ? The the the zap button . D d
D :  I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , yep .
C :  Yes .
A :  Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also .
B :  But trendy , yeah . I don't know .
A :  Or maybe you should place them on a uh , in a special way ?
C :  Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick .
A :  Yeah , something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah , and quick . You have to use it very quickly .
B :  Original . It was uh
D :  Yep .
D :  If you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus .
B :  True .
A :  Yeah , and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace .
D :  Yes .
A :  Oh , what should we decide on then ?
C :  But
A :  I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then .
B :  Yeah .
C :  No , it's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest .
A :  Yep .
B :  Maybe uh
A :  No , okay , but we don't have to uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple .
C :  No .
B :  Uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries .
C :  The most standard batteries .
A :  I think
A :  I think that we should use uh d yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh Well , it has to be simple , and I wi
D :  I think double A_ .
B :  Yeah ?
D :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The most ordinary uh batteries .
A :  Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yep .
A :  Oh . How much time do we ha we have left uh ? M m m more than thirty minutes ? Uh ten twenty minutes . Well , uh these these shouldn't
D :  I think about twenty minutes .
C :  But i in a way we have to be uh uh special .
B :  Early break .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , okay . But that's that's
A :  Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can what the extra touch can be . Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or Well , it was something about how we lose them . Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing .
C :  Maybe th m
D :  I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever .
B :  To find him . That's maybe yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I don't know . I don't know . Nah , um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i has something nice . Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener . Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control . I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . It's gonna cost twenty five Euros .
D :  Yeah , yeah , that's good one , yep .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination .
A :  Yeah , but the well , it's already been done .
B :  Yeah , but that's yeah .
A :  Nah . Yeah , that's true . But and I think it's gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . it has to be used something special , and you really it has to , you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . We're really gonna use them . Not some thing you you throw away next week , you know .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yep .
D :  No , that's true .
A :  So maybe uh that's i I think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this . So there's a very important task for you . And maybe we can all think about it . Uh , also for you maybe , when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well , you know . So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing .
B :  Be original , yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . And use friendly , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Must brain-storm .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah , a swapable front or whatever .
A :  Yeah , or just different colours would be uh I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . It could be be Yeah , you never know , but
B :  Well
C :  For the remote control .
B :  Why not ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  More money for us .
A :  But it and I think we have to make it quite big .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Quite big . Yeah , you think ?
D :  Yes , definitely , definitely .
A :  Yeah , people
C :  That's to be uh a formed for your hand .
A :  So , and and also because uh it is expensive . If you want it to be something , you know , it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it l make it
D :  Yes , it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room . As I uh as I said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . I I think you m might wanna put it uh yeah , that it it it it stands up . Yeah , you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . no no , put stuff inside it . But , it's like like a statue or something
B :  A standard or something .
D :  Yeah .
D :  A face ? Or uh yeah , yeah . Yeah .
C :  More like a joystick then .
D :  Yeah , yeah , I see what you mean , yep .
B :  It's like you have uh four phones . Something like that .
A :  Yeah yeah , but yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in
D :  If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . That's probably stupid , but uh as I found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ? Uh fifty percent
A :  That it's it's fashionable .
A :  I I don't
A :  Oh , yeah .
C :  But that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second
D :  fifty percent often loses remote control .
A :  Yeah , but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it
D :  No uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in .
A :  Oh , okay .
B :  On the television .
B :  Oh , like this .
A :  Uh , that's kind of nice .
D :  If an a button in in that uh
C :  Or you can
A :  And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable .
B :  A char chargeable . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . Why not .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that w yeah , but yeah , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't Yeah . Maybe you , but we don't know much about production cost , but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , rechargeable units .
B :  Why not .
C :  With recharger .
D :  It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course . Aye ?
A :  Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So , it's not gonna be that expen
B :  Production .
D :  Yeah , okay .
B :  It should be possible . I think it's a good idea .
A :  Uh I I think it's a great idea .
D :  Yeah .
A :  S some kind of be I've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays .
B :  To make a base or something ?
D :  Yes . Yes , definitely . Yeah .
C :  Yes , but is that handy ?
A :  Well , I well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one . And uh you can always find your remote control up
B :  It's it's it's it's
C :  But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries .
B :  it's not the purpose to be handy , it's
A :  Uh , okay . Well , maybe yeah , you could when that's when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , but you will you do need uh also an uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . Does it makes it kinda
C :  And then you
C :  Yes . Or
D :  Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . I don't know .
B :  Mm . Yeah , but that's not it's ugly , I think .
A :  Yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it .
B :  No .
D :  On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . I mean , it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it , but um I think the bay is definitely uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think it's a good idea . And make it , you know , we we um
A :  Well , we uh it's it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . We can save on the on the functions . We just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up , it's also nice . And if you put it away , I think it's uh w we have to we uh that's uh it's not a easy market . We have to something special . And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions , because we aren't gonna put
D :  Sure , why not . Yep .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  True .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Definitely .
D :  With eye candy , ear candy , whatever . Yeah , definitely .
A :  Yeah . And then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing .
A :  Yeah . I think I think it's a good idea .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have .
A :  Yeah . Oh , if it let's well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . If that's too expensive , we won't do that . But it would be nice .
D :  Definitely , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , we c
D :  It would be nice , yes .
A :  It's the idea . I know that batteries last long nowadays . And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo I've experienced that that
D :  Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes .
A :  Yeah , okay .
A :  So , easy functions . Well , we will we will I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi
B :  Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down .
D :  Yeah , why not .
A :  Yeah . But it's also annoying . 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it . Then it beeps all the time and . You don't want to have ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable . And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . Uh , i i in the in the ma Yeah , but it w I mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . Then when they look get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh , I think it's brilliant . Yeah , I've never it's so simple , but I've never seen it .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  true .
D :  No , that's true .
D :  Why not .
C :  But you pay for it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  No . Nearly .
B :  And you can leave it just there .
A :  M maybe we should really do this . Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? These clocks aren't uh synched . Oh , now I've put uh well , it is twenty p Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , I'll
D :  Something like that , yeah .
A :  Yeah , but we're uh we're done . I think .
B :  Uh fifteen minutes .
A :  We've decided on the functions . Well , there is some oh .
A :  There is a closing sheet .
A :  We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work .
D :  Oh .
A :  Oh okay , I'll make sure I'll I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see . I think these are more important than the first ones , so
D :  We'll see .
B :  Can you make an uh uh
B :  a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ? That not not everything in one one uh folder .
A :  .
D :  Maarten , five minutes .
A :  Oh , five minutes . Yeah , because uh I I d I did uh the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could uh , know , use for the other ones well , but uh I d think uh I forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something . And then you you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . Becau I d uh , it was not my uh pen .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Maybe .
D :  No , that's true uh , yeah .
D :  Should we by the way draw um
A :  this kind of looks you like .
D :  on our nice whiteboard , um a little uh idea of yeah .
A :  Of the shape .
B :  Or the sh
A :  Yeah , probably , it would be nice .
D :  I dunno . Has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? I don't , for one .
B :  Do you get an idea of the shape ?
C :  Maybe like this pen .
D :  A bit bigger I guess , but
A :  No , bigger .
B :  A little bit bigger , yeah but
D :  The shape is nice , it's um
D :  something different , and we want we want that . Yeah .
C :  It has to feel nice in your hand .
A :  Well , I I I have to say , I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all , or I think some maybe we should no , that will be too costly . We shou we could also , that was a would also be an idea , but I don't think it I don't know if it exists already , you should like make Alessi or something design it .
B :  Oh , uh look uh look at the pictures .
D :  Okay , yeah .
A :  That would also be nice .
A :  But that's gonna then you c then you don't
D :  Yeah , but twelve and a half Euros ? Uh
A :  Yeah , but then you don't have t yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time , you know s was it's a single cost . Yeah , m but but then you can nah , I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive , because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  Would be a nice idea though .
A :  I don't know . I think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something .
A :  Like something like that or so or so
D :  Something like that is very ergonomic .
A :  And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round .
D :  So
A :  Put it in there uh wire on it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well .
B :  Yeah , flash lights at the side . At the side , or something like that .
A :  Volume and programme , yeah .
D :  Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part .
A :  And some of the extra funct
A :  Some of the extra functions over here . Numbers .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , and the numbers on top , I guess .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And and lights ? How we're g well , maybe uh s a ring of no , no , you have to Maybe on the side of it .
D :  Maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry .
B :  Yeah , side of it . Just two LEDs or something on the side . Yeah .
A :  Along the side uh strip of yeah .
D :  Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons .
A :  Yeah , but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote .
D :  Oh .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , theys have to be
B :  Well , uh probably at the side .
B :  You know look at the front , but
A :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Exactly . When you you see it from the side , then it would look just like that .
B :  Yeah , exactly , and then there is yeah .
A :  And then you have
A :  a strip of uh lights or something .
B :  Yeah , something like that , yeah .
D :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Well , uh I think it's nice , for one thing . maybe put something on top of it or , you know , like that's looks funny . I don't know .
B :  No . No .
A :  Or some bump . Maybe some Yeah ?
D :  I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then .
B :  Bumper or something .
A :  We'll have to think about it . I think we're we're done .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yes , we are .
A :  We can save this one .
D :  Alright . Yes , I guess it's lunch time .
B :  Lunch break .
B :  Okay then .
A :  Mm mm .
D :  I don't know .
D :  Half and hour ? I thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour .
B :  Okay , five uh
A :  Yeah , that was what uh
D :  I don't know about the lunch break .
A :  Mm , we'll hear about it .
D :  Well
B :  Oh .
B :  .
A :  Okay , all set ? Welcome to the conceptual design meeting .
B :  Uh , okay .
C :  Yes .
A :  The agenda . The opening . I'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . So um , who wants to start off ? Technical uh designer again ? Okay .
B :  Again .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not uh quite okay . It uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . So But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just ordinary keyboard .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
B :  Uh , may be better , yeah .
D :  Keyboard work . Yeah .
A :  I think it will
A :  will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Alright .
C :  Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of .
C :  Um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . We have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls .
C :  Um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah , it feels uh good in your hand .
C :  Mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . Uh I've got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction .
C :  uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . Mm
C :  It's okay . Yeah .
C :  I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh
B :  Oh .
C :  the energy source , uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . Um ,
C :  uh the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um
C :  Uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah , kinetic uh
C :  energy . Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls .
D : 
A : 
C :  uh also the case material , uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium
C :  would also be a bit weird .
B :  Oh titanium is
B :  probably trendy , I think .
D :  That's true , I guess . Yeah .
B :  .
B :  Well , maybe a little bit expensive .
B :  I don't know .
D :  Huh .
C :  Uh , they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium .
C :  the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . Also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . Um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the
C :  components are uh just available in uh
C :  in our uh factory .
C :  Mm ,
C :  I've told about uh the three first points . Mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter . Uh , it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company .
C :  Um , another possibility . I uh
C :  yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . Could be uh
C :  something special to our uh remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros .
A :  Twelve and a half .
C :  Ah yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Actually
B :  Yeah , production cost .
C :  I th I got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one . You see uh a covers , which can be
A :  What are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so
C :  Um , I don't know . Um
A :  But it's actually kind of uh well , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj You know the the cartoonish Alessi kind of design .
B :  I
C :  Yes .
D :  Yep .
C :  Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh maybe a kind of uh whole uh
A :  And we can we can steal their ideas .
C :  a whole set of uh different uh remote controls . Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh
A :  Huh .
C :  with a huge variety of uh
A :  Well , it's a possibility , too .
C :  uh house uh stuff . Like uh maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this in the same style , but
B :  Different colours also .
A :  Uh-uh .
D :  Yeah , that'll be for the future , I guess .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , because we have to uh we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it .
A :  Next time we're here .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Oh , okay .
D :  Yeah . Definitely .
A :  Okay .
D :  Alright .
C :  Thank you .
B :  Okay .
B :  uh
D :  Yeah . That's okay .
B :  Ah .
B :  Well , I shall go to the next slide . Um
B :  um , I still don't have any information about user requirements . I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh
A :  Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting .
B :  Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements . I ha I ha I have the I have
A :  Didn't we ?
A :  Oh , okay . Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi Just no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only .
B :  nothing .
B :  Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of .
A :  Okay .
B :  I dunno if they're maybe a little bit more , but
A :  Well we maybe we can think of that later . W just these are the ones you already summed up in the
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I I uh well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier . Um
A :  Okay .
B :  Another function uh is of course we already discuss it on the side . Um , I don't know what costs of it . Uh , I've no idea about it . Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit
B :  too much for twelve and a half .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Production . If we got already uh something like a base .
C :  Uh-huh .
A :  That might get redundant also maybe . I don't know what kind of information it would
B :  Yeah , I don't know . I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , it's okay .
C :  Maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t to the remote control .
B :  The remote control . a little uh too A little bit
D :  Then you and then you've got a flag s Very big R_C_ . Yeah .
A :  Okay . That's not
B :  A little bit too big , I think .
A :  It was not a good idea .
B :  Exactly .
A :  Okay .
B :  Um , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think . It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no V_C_R_ or that kind of uh , so that's very easy .
A :  No . No .
D :  No .
B :  Um
A :  But you do mention the next and previous uh button .
B :  Mm-hmm . Well , that's next channel . I mean next channel . Uh
D :  Next channel , previous channel .
A :  Oh , okay , o okay okay .
B :  Um oh , I I got an email with with an uh a remote control with a base . So , it's uh just an idea .
A :  Huh .
B :  And I um
B :  uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small
C :  But you're the expert .
D :  I think it depends on the function .
B :  Well , I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Maybe it
D :  Well , if you save uh Perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that of course .
B :  Well uh okay , that's your point . Um , yeah . Yeah , okay .
A : 
B :  Yeah , I've nothing to s
D :  Oh , that's right .
A :  Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger .
B :  Uh , with a little bit larger , yeah . I thought so , but maybe with the
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have yeah , they have to be large . Uh , I mean th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the to skip channels and to uh
B :  Yeah , that groups . Large ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yep .
A :  I think yeah , I don't know why , but I think that is that's t trendy too , because that's the mo it it you know , it's uh acc acc um accentu uh , how do you say it ?
B :  Most the most used uh buttons .
D :  Those are probably the the th
A :  It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t
D :  Yes .
B :  True . Yeah .
D :  Those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control .
A :  Yeah .
C :  You did the research .
A :  And you want to acc accentuate that , you know .
B :  Yeah .
C :  It's from your research .
D :  Sorry ?
D :  Yeah , sure .
A :  So
B :  Okay . Uh , that was all y uh personal preference I didn't have . I didn't had any time left . So Yeah , .
A :  Okay .
A :  No uh , that's coo it's cool .
D :  You don't care . No , sorry .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Oh .
D :  Go away .
D :  Come on .
B :  It's there .
B :  Yeah , click on it .
D :  .
B :  Couple time .
D :  Oh , great .
D :  Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet .
D :  Um I've done some investigation , and uh well
D :  I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan .
D :  Some uh some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . Uh , well , we were going to imply that , so that's nice . The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ . Uh , our market really likes really likes that . And uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . And uh , well , for the idea , I've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people . Dark colours , simple recognisable shapes . So we probably won't do that .
D :  The younger market likes uh Well , the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . I found this image , which is uh Well , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables . I don't see the spongy part in it . But with a little bit of fancy
A :  Well maybe c then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then .
D :  Exactly . I got some ideas Uh well , yeah , pictures isn't really good word , but um
D :  some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . Uh , catchy colours . Fruit is uh yellow , green , red , whatever . So , remote controls in in catchy colours . Uh , no , we don't want dark colours . No , I just put them there to uh , yeah , uh for general idea . And uh , the docking st uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself . But to
A :  It doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours .
A :  Not the dark colours ? Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , the To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . At the bottom of the docking station or whatever . And uh , we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah uh uh v how do you say ?
A :  For diversity or something . Uh
D :  Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . I mean it it it reaches a different market uh , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . Yes .
B :  Well , how uh
B :  But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control ? Uh , make it a banana ?
A :  No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . It's like a pear or something .
D :  Yeah , there's there's always a
D :  Well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control . I mean I think this part of the R_C_ uh well the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons , I guess . So you you can put some fruity things
A :  No , I don't think you have to do it like
A :  Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . And so y I I think this y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something .
D :  No , of course not .
D :  Especially i
B :  Yeah , but th yeah , but that
D :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah , exactly .
B :  Yeah , but that's
D :  If we make it little bit greenish .
A :  Yeah .
A :  You do get the idea , eh ? The fruity kind of round 'Kay .
B :  Yeah uh uh
D :  A and we could use one of these for the uh w what is it ?
A :  Yeah , uh yeah , I don't know . Uh , this is a b yeah .
C :  Grapes .
D :  Uh
D :  Isn't
D :  Wha whatever .
B :  But d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ?
A :  Yeah , yeah . Of course we have uh
D :  Yeah , sure .
D :  Yeah .
A :  we have a very big uh the s
D :  Well , w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . This is then the uh pear . I don't know the English word , so forget it . And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control , but m yeah .
C :  For a big team of artists .
A :  Of d design team , yeah .
A :  Yeah , but
A :  It's pear , I guess .
C :  But uh but I think we don't have to make
C :  we can't make all uh ten designs . We have to make one design I th I I think .
A :  No .
A :  No , but I think it's it's already what we were were up to . Uh , it's it doesn't have to resemble uh what I already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on . And it's it looks fruity to me .
D :  Mayb maybe two or three .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  No sure , but but
D :  B but that's great , and and and what I was what what I was saying , the catchy colours
A :  And uh , but I do like the yeah , I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too .
C :  But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables
D :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe it's too much , you know .
B :  But , we we have to um There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it . Yellow , a Real Reaction .
D :  Yeah , uh not really . Pictures was a was a bad word , but
A :  Okay , but what are the This is yellow .
D :  Well we c yeah .
C :  Yes , you can put a logo on top of it .
A :  But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable .
D :  Yeah , sure .
B :  Uh , yeah .
D :  Maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here . I can't draw with this thing , but I'll try . If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here . It doesn't work . And then
C :  Yes , it's really fruity .
B :  We uh f
B :  A yellow do
B :  Uh , yeah .
B :  Yeah , and the button then .
C :  With a strawberry on top .
A :  Yeah , on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do
D :  Well , the button button over here or whatever , I don't know .
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  On the front , of course , because else you can't find it .
B :  Okay .
D :  Well , that were my ideas a little bit .
D :  I'll close 'em down . Um , go away .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , you can you open the conceptual design presentation ?
D :  Conceptual design , yes .
A :  See what was on the agenda .
B :  Lazy .
D :  The agenda .
A :  This is his own remote . Because um , maybe we can start with the technical uh functions , but I don't think it's there uh , yeah um , do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it . I mean
C :  Only if we
C :  Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on .
A :  Me neither .
D :  Yeah , but it should be li like this big , and I don't think
A :  Yeah , but it's so
C :  No , no , only the T_V_ channel with the with uh with uh four programmes . You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button .
A :  I don't think we should do it .
D :  Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because
C :  Yes , it can
C :  On your
C :  No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . So why not on your remote ?
A :  Yeah , but no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually . And it's also not I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , it's
D :  Yeah , I don't know .
B :  Well well what would you display on it then ?
C :  Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide
D :  Programme information . But
B :  But is it isn't that a already on T_V_ , a lot of new T_V_s ?
C :  on t on teletext , yes . Also on the internet . But
D :  Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a
A :  But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , but you also want to know what's next .
D :  But then we also uh w need to bring out a line of T_V_s which we were planning to , but whatever . Because the T_V_ has to send information back to the R_C_ , and I don't know if that's possible .
B :  Yeah , and we also have to yeah .
C :  Yes , that's uh really possible .
D :  Yes , yes , o of course it's possible , but you gotta uh implement it in the T_V_s , and I don't think everyone's gonna buy a Real Reaction T_V_ within a month after the release of our uh remote control .
B :  And I also
A :  I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an L_C_D_ in it , but I I really don't think it's a good n goo because it also doesn't stroke with we wanted uh c When we talk about the materials , uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . You know , it's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know .
D :  Yeah .
D :  That's true , that's true , it breaks f yeah , it it it's not very solid , it's uh frag fragile .
A :  Yeah , yeah . You could make it , but it's just it it doesn't I don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after .
D :  No . No . I don't think so ei either .
A :  But that's my opinion . Well , you you y Okay , we can vote for it . You want the L_C_D_ display . I don't want to and he doesn't , so it's up to him . If we wanna
C :  No .
D :  . Ah .
B :  Yeah , I dunno .
A :  And I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of veto veto uh rights .
B :  . Oh , okay .
D :  Bastard .
A :  So I can also say
B :  We can you away .
A :  But did we skip the Yeah , you could do m but what what i so what i but do you think we should
B :  Yeah , I don't know . Uh , uh I i if it's it's a simple p
A :  We're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . So
B :  No , that that's right , and uh I also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it . Kind of L_C_D_ or something or
C :  No uh um
C :  Y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions .
D :  Yeah , I guess .
B :  But how does it display then ? W when I go to the second channel , what what does it show me ?
C :  Uh , then you push a button .
C :  The title and the information about the programme . But but uh yeah , what he said was right , about the televisions , they have to be uh customised to the
B :  About that programme ?
A :  Nah , that's not gonna work .
D :  No .
C :  But maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first
A :  Yeah .
A :  Oh , well uh I've seen it done before . Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d L_C_D_ displays , but then it's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling . So it's that that's what I've seen .
C :  you have the biggest uh
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's true , if you uh Yeah .
C :  Yes , you can put uh a little L_C_D_ display on it with uh with lots of information . But uh I haven't thought about it .
A :  But it just it j it doesn't doesn't match with the our whole basic concept .
C :  But whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh
C :  uh screen on top of it , it i it isn't vulnerable . You can throw with it and
A :  Well yeah , yeah , okay . That's maybe not the most important , but it's just
B :  Is it fashion ?
C :  When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from
A :  I don't think so .
B :  I don't know . That's not up to you . That's up to market if i if it's trendy . Because our our motto is we put fashion
A :  Yeah , well do you ha do you have to You haven't looked after the trendiness of L_C_D_ displays , have you ?
D :  No .
D :  Well , I think it's uh I think it's pretty trendy , to be honest , uh but um I don't know if if if well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . And I think uh especially colour L_C_D_ , which is indeed pretty trendy . But I don't think Uh , I think it will be too expensive .
C :  But uh I've got a the email with uh with the possibilities . And L_C_D_ was a possibility for the remote control . So why don't we use it .
A :  Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Uh , did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh L_C_D_ or uh coloured L_C_D_ ?
A :  Yeah , but we're gonna if it
B :  Yeah , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured . Coloured
D :  Yeah really , if y if you c i
B :  If you have black and white or something , or grey , that's
D :  I in in two thousand and four you can't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme . Really .
A :  Then uh then you better don't yeah , d
C :  No , but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or But , mm ,
C :  I alf I also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it . But
A :  Uh uh I really don't feel the whole idea of an L_C_D_ display . I'm sorry . It can't co you cannot convince me . I don't know how well how to with you guys , but
C :  I didn't think that
A :  I don't really feel it . We already we're uh Yeah , we already have the the th th th base station gadgets , and want and it uh uh , do it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft
B :  It's too much uh maybe uh with with the L_C_D_ and the docking station and
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , but o on the
D :  W we've we've gotta find a balance , of course . And I think
B :  With one thing special . Not a whole package of specialty .
A :  I don't think
A :  I j uh , and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . Uh , I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs . Y we want to it's simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you don't need an L_C_D_ .
C :  No , when y
C :  But it look
C :  Yes , but that remote controls are already on the market . The simple
A :  It doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote .
C :  Yes , but but when you want to have something special
A :  Yeah , but we already have the docking station , which is
C :  Yes , but you had a picture of it from another company .
D :  We have a pear .
B :  And uh the
A :  It has to be developed , but no , but it that's that's our that's our killer feature . That's our what makes it special .
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's just an it's just an idea . It's a it's
C :  Yes , it was already made . Tha the remote control on the docking station .
A :  Yeah , we're gonna develop our own r n docking station .
B :  True .
D :  Is that so ? Was it it wasn't just a prototype ?
C :  Yes , he have a picture of it .
B :  Well uh I uh
B :  Yeah , I dunno .
D :  Exactly , I've never seen it in a store .
A :  Uh , but re we really have to cut this off , I re I know you I I I I I get the idea you really like it , you know , the the L_C_D_ thing , but I I think it's it's not a good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments . I don't uh , do you guys agre How do you guys think ? I d
B :  No , it's too much .
D :  I think it's a little too much , yeah .
B :  It's overdone .
A :  Okay , we s skip the L_C_D_ display . I'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Democratically .
D :  No .
D :  .
C :  Mayb
C :  I will rule the world with it .
A :  But
A :  Probably so . Okay . But for the technical part . The m material , I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . Uh
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yes , maybe a bit of a cushion is
A :  Yeah yeah yeah , p Exactly . This is what it w Yeah , but it it was already what we're uh we're after , you know , to give it uh , you know , the soft touch in your hands and also to , know , like Yeah , that is y the b airbag kind of thing . You can st throw it at your little brother's head .
D :  Yeah , for the spongy uh feel . Yeah .
C :  Yes .
B :  With a spongy Bob feel .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Like a b yes .
B :  Yeah , you just can drop it . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , airbag .
D :  If you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . No no no , not that comfy .
C :  Maybe it but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see .
A :  Yeah yeah . Yeah . Okay , that's a that's a good point . And that's why I like the dark t col dark colour bit , you know , because it may be the design uh , it's uh maybe it is a bit of the
D :  Yeah .
B :  But not black I think .
A :  it's a bit nineties maybe , what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point .
D :  No .
B :  Well if if it's fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful .
A :  Yeah , that's that's true , but but it has to be a little big solid . It mustn't be too , n you know , th too overwhelming , then when you put it on your just
D :  Yeah , b yeah , that's what w I I was pointing at .
B :  But can we ge uh uh
B :  Can we combine it or something ? Uh with uh yellow and black ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , maybe so .
B :  Make it a bee ?
D :  What ? Oh , a bee . Oh .
B :  A bee .
A :  No , uh I don't like the yellow and black combination . But it is our company colours . Apparently .
C :  Yes , real real good colours .
B :  Yeah , it's our yeah . We we have to use yellow .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  I don't like yellow , and uh maybe I don't know .
D :  Well , we can as as I
C :  But that's not really fruity .
D :  draw really nicely over there . We can put the logo on our uh on our base station . Uh , yeah . And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself . But , i
A :  But
A :  Okay , but what uh , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ?
C :  Uh fronts
C :  of the
C :  We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the
A :  Should we do that ? I don't think you we should do that . Maybe just bring it out in different colours , but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much . People don't wanna spend more money on their remote control , I guess .
C :  telephone .
B :  Different fronts .
D :  Yeah . I guess that's that's enough .
D :  That's way too Nokia .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh , you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants , yeah . Yeah , Three three or four uh four uh colours , or something like that .
C :  Are these designs ?
A :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah , definitely . Just bring more designs on the market .
D :  Why not , yeah .
A :  But uh , without gon uh okay . So , are we through the technical part then ?
C :  Yes .
A :  Okay . So we uh agreed upon uh n uh well , not u unanimously or how you call it , but Yeah .
C :  It this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles .
B :  Well , yeah , the
B :  Three to one . That's
A :  The materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite okay . O o only only the last point your no titanium's not not out of question , I guess .
C :  Yes .
B :  And tita uh titanium , is uh is is it a no ? Is
C :  Yes ,
C :  But also w
B :  It's just like that , th this titanium .
C :  Yes , b bu but when we use s soft
A :  But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ? Makes it in a homogeneous uh design .
C :  mm
D :  Sure .
C :  Mm .
B :  No , not all , not all of them .
C :  But it it then it uh you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff
C :  when you throw with uh titanium with your remote control . No uh ,
A :  It will it will break other stuff w when it's plastic , as well .
A :  Yeah .
C :  titanium is a bit uh it's a bit harder . But also on the colours , the young
D :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  No , but uh uh , you should ma Yeah .
A :  Okay , think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium . Well would it be more trendy ? More chic ?
D :  Yeah , I think it I think it does .
B :  Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic .
C :  Yes , but a titanium remote control , when you're uh watching T_V_ uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty , and the
B :  In trendy things .
D :  Yeah , o
D :  On the other hand , if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's cold in the winter .
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing . But the question is i then it's , you know , is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh , know , like uh
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's true , that's true .
C :  Sports and gaming . Define .
A :  When you make it titanium , it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need . And when it's big and plastic , it's like some fun stuff you can always have around . It's always fun to have something big and plastic around .
B :  You have that uh M_P_ three player of Nike , I saw . Isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber ?
D :  Yes . Yeah .
C :  Yes , it's w but it is uh plastic .
B :  Isn't it
B :  Is plastic ? Well , it's titanium looking .
C :  Yes , w we can do that on the on the
D :  What ?
B :  Yeah , he is . Here he is . Uh , the I don't know if you know the M_P_ three player of Nike . 'Kay , uh that that's very uh with rubber , so it's very
D :  Oh , yeah . Okay , yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's beautiful .
D :  Yeah , I see .
C :  We can make this as a style too . Uh , this is uh just a
D :  Yeah , but but but
B :  rough .
D :  Yeah , I th I think that's difficult , because uh that's different material , and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of
A :  Oh , maybe th maybe this is an
C :  No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic .
D :  Yeah , if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then , I guess it's it's nice to have one of these .
D :  Uh
C :  Uh
A :  No , I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it . You know , like the the soft stuff , but I don't know if it's possible .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I don't have the information . Uh , I I didn't got it
A :  But you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look . But make it just like shiny . Maybe we should uh shou
C :  Yes .
B :  True .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah yeah , true . Yeah , maybe that's good idea , yeah . But if you want to la uh yeah , last longer than two weeks or something like that , you can maybe
C :  Like the M_P_ three player .
D :  Yeah .
A :  And uh and
A :  maybe we sh should we t I don't know if we should talk about uh , how how much time have we got left ?
C :  Uh , in a lot of other uh
B :  I don't know . What time does
A :  Forty minutes .
C :  in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry . Uh , they began with uh t typical uh leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all sort of colours , and w kind of fon of uh of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Like Eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and
A :  You putting in different colours .
C :  Yes , and and styles . They have uh also uh a kind of uh um
A :  Okay .
C :  uh roses on it , a and uh
D :  Uh yeah , yeah .
A :  Okay . Yeah , but w yeah . Well , it is . It's a possibility . But , let's think about the bas
C :  Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new uh with new colours , new yes .
D :  Yes .
D :  New prints on it . Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . But wha th our basic idea y I mean , you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it . And and pro and lights . We have to incorporate the lights too . But , uh do w gonna gonna are we going to give it a two-tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ? Is that the idea ? Is that a good idea ?
D :  How do you mean ? Th th the uh base in a in another
B :  The rubber .
A :  How many colours are we how many colours are we gonna we're uh uh f uh f Only five minutes left , by the way . How many colours are we gonna give it ? Like two-tone colour ? T
D :  Yes .
C :  There there are three uh components three components type . You have the buttons , the the case uh itself , and the rubber and th
B :  Yeah . Uh no , not too much I think .
D :  How the buttons yeah .
A :  I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , and the cushions as well should be in another colour .
C :  Yes .
B :  Or you just make uh one colour , uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , but not more than Well , yeah , it's No . Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting .
B :  In in another colour . Not more than two colours I think . It's a g a little bit too flashy .
D :  No , definitely not .
D :  Yes , definitely .
C :  Yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it you can use two colours as well uh
A :  Okay . But we have to uh think of some other uh important things . Uh oh yeah , the the functionalities of the the buttons .
B :  The funct yeah , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea .
A :  No .
D :  No , I think that's too vulnerable .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I think this is okay , the so we have the basic . Then we have the numbers . We have the power button . We have we have a teletext button .
B :  The volume , teletext and
A :  And maybe want to access a a menu or something . Most T_V_s have a menu .
D :  Yeah , but that's that's I was thinking that's gotta be on the television .
A :  Yeah , but I think you ha I really need a menu button . That's just i the only button only
B :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah , b
B :  Yeah , but wha what kind of menu ? Is uh isn't that different from every television ?
A :  You know , I
A :  No , I think most T_V_s have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings . And so
D :  Mm . Yeah , if it's c if
D :  Yeah , I think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh and if the T_V_ doesn't have a menu , then
A :  But that that covers all the all the other settings . It covers everything then .
C :  But then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever .
A :  No , you can use the
A :  And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem uh yeah , mute . A teletext and a menu , and then then i that's it . It's all we need . Okay , uh another stuf some stuff about the the the design of the docking station . Something important about a s uh , no , uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself , I guess .
C :  Okay .
D :  Mm , yeah .
D :  A mute and a teletext and a menu .
B :  Mute .
D :  That's all .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Great . Yeah .
B :  Okay , that's not mu not much functions . So
D :  Yeah , definitely . Are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there ?
A :  Uh , in one colour . Just use
A :  I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side . And we will make it spongy and and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh
C :  Uh
D :  Yeah , that's true , that's true .
D :  Yeah , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh uh w
A :  Yeah , but we're gonna have to we really have to think I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , that when you uh , know , some things is just over the top , and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you it just gets annoying , because it's so big and flashy . Uh , it has to be some level of subtlety , but we have to still have to think of how we manage to uh
D :  Yeah , definitely .
A :  to get to that .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Guess we're through then .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  I guess so .
A :  But we I think also we just so we have to do something with colour but also , I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind . I think that's uh adds to the too much colour maybe m um
D :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Too much colour , i it uh when you got it in a living room , it's too much maybe . It has to be
A :  But our des design experts will uh work that out . Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . So we will wrap up .
D :  Yea yeah .
D :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Something like that .
A :  Or is there anything we'd like to discuss ?
D :  I guess not .
A :  That's right .
A :  Okay .
D :  Do you , guys ?
B :  No .
D :  No ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the pro probably . Yeah uh no , for su for sure because I'm will now type them out .
D :  In the shared folder .
B :  Oh , okay , yeah .
C :  What are we going to do now ?
A :  Uh , y yeah .
D :  You'll see in you email , I guess .
B :  Yeah . I hope so . And the other thing is that you don't have kind of prototype or something like that . You see a kinda prototype you can a little bit more uh
A :  I think uh
D :  Yeah , I don't know . I don't know .
C :  I will make one in the next uh twenty minutes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Construct one , yeah .
A :  But toilet paper roll and uh
B :  With you laptop ? Yeah .
B :  Oh my God .
A :  Okay .
D :  Alright , shall we get back to work ? Great .
A :  Yep . I was waiting for the l last message , but
B :  Well you are . We're not .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Bastard .
C :  Back to the pen .
D :  You lazy
A :  Mm yeah .
A :  Okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting .
A :  Again , I'm gonna take minutes . Oh , we're gonna have a prototype presentation first . Uh , who's gonna give the prototype presentation ? You two guys ? Okay . Go ahead .
C :  Yes .
C : 
B :  .
D :  .
B :  coffee .
C :  'Kay , we've made a prototype . Um , we've got uh
C :  uh our aspects from the last meeting . Uh , especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . Um , we've uh drawn here the p prototype . The logo is uh
C :  is uh
C :  is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control , but
C :  it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher .
C :  Um ,
C :  our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . Maybe you can uh point them uh
B :  Uh , well the uh all the functions are discussed uh I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . Uh , it's a little bit . Uh , power button .
C :  The functions .
B :  Uh then the the the nine uh channels .
B :  Uh the volume uh
B :  uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . And then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext I thought that was th
A :  Oh no , the the the mute button misses now . Do y do you did we want to have a m mute button ?
D :  Alright , I
B :  Oh , the mute button .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But uh that It's uh here then , in the middle .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Huh .
D :  Alright , and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button .
C :  Yes , um
C :  we've disc
B :  Well , yeah mo uh mo Yeah , well most of them are right-handed .
D :  Yeah , but you you gotta make it clear on the on
C :  Most of the users
C :  Yes , y there there will be a p a little a little P_ on that and a little uh yeah .
B :  Yeah well , I don't have time in uh anymore on the
D :  Yeah , and a and a triangle on that .
B :  Oh yeah , just progr programme above , I think .
D :  Yes . Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually .
A :  Wait , there's was one thing I wanted to ask . Uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like
A :  uh d I call it teens and twenties . Uh , y th th th the two numbers .
C :  Yes .
D :  All n no , that's um kinda dependent on the television .
B :  Yeah , true , yeah .
C :  It's a television . Yes .
B :  Uh
A :  Yeah , but do we have do we need extra buttons , for example some uh some have to
D :  I think
B :  Uh I think so .
C :  Yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh yes .
D :  Yeah , I think you should add
B :  Zero ?
D :  A cross , or whatever . Yeah , line .
B :  May maybe here ?
A :  Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them , becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds No , I don't think so .
B :  Yeah .
B :  And then a second .
D :  No , that's dependent on the television .
C :  Yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press
D :  I do know so .
B :  Is it depending on television ?
A :  Nah , I don't think so really , because you have a I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , but but a lot uh
D :  Yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television . Or actually , the other way around . But
A :  No , I think uh I really think it's n because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , but
D :  Yeah , well but su If
C :  some televisions don't accept uh that that
A :  Yeah , because that's i it's for television . It's exact the same thing .
C :  No , no , but s
D :  No no no . So some television respond differently . Look , if uh i i
A :  No , listen listen . When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . The one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one .
D :  Yes .
D :  Yes , that's true .
B :  Yeah .
B :  True .
D :  No
A :  I think it works that way , really .
D :  No , it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space .
A :  Yeah , but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button .
C :  Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons .
A :  Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point . I think it's exact the same thing when y
D :  Yep . True .
C :  You want
C :  Yes , but some television don't support it .
A :  No , but then they would a would also support that button , because it's the same thing . Listen , with that that's that special but button you're talking about , eh ? That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . Do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had
B :  But the ex
D :  No , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c
C :  No , a remote can
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , so they need no , they need
A :  But you give the input . You push the one . That's the same thing as the button with the one and it yes it it is . Think about it .
D :  No , that's not true . It's simply not true . It's simply not true . Uh
B :  Yeah . You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something
C :  No , but uh
A :  And it's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one .
D :  No , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds . Remote control is a stupid thing . If you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television .
A :  Yeah , that's true . Yeah , but I m uh but it's I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works . But okay , we we'll impl
C :  Yeah , it
D :  No , definitely not . Definitely not .
B :  We'll discuss them in the usability lab .
A :  No , we'll apply them then for now .
B :  Uh eva evaluation . I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary .
A :  Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . Yeah , I think so . Yeah , for now , if we don't know for sure whether
B :  Yeah ?
B :  Okay .
C :  And the button for the SCART uh audio video uh external input .
D :  Yes .
B :  Ach .
A :  Yeah but okay . What I said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , but I still think i it it all T_V_s in some ways support it , I don't know . I think it's more c is m maybe we don't uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works , but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said .
D :  Uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , I guess . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  No , no .
C :  Uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press .
A :  I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M
C :  Uh , some
C :  N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten
A :  Th won't work wi with uh to have that special button .
C :  No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . When you uh press one button , you give one signal . And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher .
C :  But
D :  Yep .
A :  Okay , well we'll see .
C :  When you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals ,
C :  it could work , but
C :  Just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y
C :  most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote .
D :  Okay . I kinda miss the docking station .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes . It's here on the
B :  Well it yeah , uh there's nothing I think it's pretty basic , the the there's no fu there's one there's one button , that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it .
C :  We came uh
C :  Yes .
D :  No nothing really trendy about it .
C :  But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh
D :  The button .
D :  Yep .
C :  uh hearing devices .
D :  I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices .
C :  Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh
D :  Yeah , of course .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape , of course .
C :  Yes , but we can make
D :  The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true . But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit .
C :  No , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same .
D :  Yeah , that's true , but uh
C :  When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it .
D :  Yes , but uh I I g
C :  Just have to be big enough for the biggest
D :  Shouldn't it fall then ? It isn't going to fall down ? That's a bit uh yeah , I think
C :  No , when you make it large enough no it it will not . But then it's a little bit
D :  No , but if if like this , I'll I'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , I won't draw it really . If you got a base which is uh as big as this
C :  But it's just an idea .
C :  But it's flat it's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this .
B :  You can .
D :  Yeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can
B :  But i i i it's backwards .
C :  Yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big
B :  But it's it's backwards . It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station .
D :  Yeah . Uh , wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom oh , right , help . Uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh in in the
B :  That's text .
A :  But
C :  Yes , little holer littler Uh , little products go deeper in it .
D :  Yeah . That i that is possible , yep .
A :  Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come . But we have to look n I don't know .
D :  Yeah , sure , you're right .
C :  Yes . And uh uh
D :  Oh .
C :  the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . Then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button ,
D :  I don't like the colours .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb .
C :  So it's it's it's really good design .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . Alright .
A :  Yes . That's it ?
C :  Yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it .
D :  The light .
D :  Okay . And other lights ?
A :  I think added lights are gonna be a problem too .
C :  Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it .
D :  No , o on the on the front .
D :  Yeah , okay . Maybe the uh the logo .
C :  Yes .
B :  lights ?
C :  But , it will also uh uh use batteries , and do we want to
D :  Yeah , why not ?
D :  Of course .
A :  Okay . For now , uh this is uh is good enough .
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , what was uh on the
C :  The all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh
A :  Okay , but in the oh yeah , the colour , because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , isn't it ? Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons . And they're be a they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . Okay . And I think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh , in the same colour as the side .
B :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think I think that'll be good .
C :  Yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , so it will uh
D :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , we'll talk about the lights later . 'Cause I also don yeah , it's depends on the costs and such . But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , but may I dunno if that's important , but we'll talk about that later . Okay , for now this is this is okay . Um , the next p y you gonna give a presentation too ? Uh , I have to see the agenda .
C :  Yes .
D :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
D :  We will .
D :  Well , uh yeah , I I'm gonna do something right there , yeah .
C :  No .
A :  Detail design .
D :  We gotta do that on the right the most right-most screen , because the leftmost
A :  Evaluation criteria .
D :  Yep , that's me .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Alright . I will be needing that image , so leave it please . Um
D :  Go away .
D :  Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points . Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . I wanna have a colour over here , come on . Right , the remote is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but
D :  the positive things has to be on the left , so I said not ugly instead of ugly . Uh , what would you say , we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . The remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , I think four maybe would be appropriate , because it's
A :  Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . Uh , I mean it's kind of , our design . It's so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . I don't know or uh I don't know how you
D :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Background colour .
D :  How do you guys feel ?
C :  I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own yes , you can make it in your own uh
A :  Casting . Yeah .
D :  The different designs . Yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  more to your own personality or or house style .
A :  Yeah , but we d we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts , I believe . With a colour a co a colours . Oh , okay .
D :  No , not not fronts , but different designs .
B :  No , not fronts . Different designs . Different colours maybe , yeah .
C :  Yes .
D :  And that's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , I guess . What ?
A :  Okay , but
A :  Oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our
D :  Yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? Personally .
C :  Or forty .
A :  Yeah .
B :  We can make it a one .
D :  Personally .
D :  Yes , but what is it ?
C :  I think two or three .
B :  Mm yeah .
D :  Guido ?
B :  I agree .
D :  Two or three .
B :  Um , I uh I go for the positive . So I go for two .
D :  I was
D :  I was thinking about three , so I guess
A :  Uh , I was thinking about four , so I think three is uh
D :  three is uh a bit uh oh , what am I doing ? I'll mark it . The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy .
B :  Okay , three .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah well , let that let's make that a one .
C :  Yes .
B :  Two .
D :  Yeah ? Antek , you agree ?
B :  One . One . Okay yeah , I'll I'll agree .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes .
D :  Yeah . You're not Antek .
A :  That's one thing for sure .
B :  I'm the I'm the usability , so
D :  I totally agree . The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , two or a one , I guess . It's something we really put work into .
B :  The
D :  Yeah , I yeah . I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . And our oh yeah , it's a b yeah . Yeah ? Alright . That's a one ? You agree ?
C :  It's all about the buttons .
A :  Yeah .
D :  The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . I think we totally succeeded there . Oh
A :  But
B :  Well
A :  Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . And telete
B :  Yeah , well menu Yeah , maybe .
D :  Yeah , that's true . That's true .
C :  Also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , o they're used uh uh
A :  Yeah , we don't know if the uh they're necessary .
D :  the the yeah , m well , you d you've got a point .
A :  I think a two .
B :  Yeah , true . Yeah , I agree .
C :  Can yes , three , two .
A :  Came a long way , but not we didn't not uh
D :  Two or three ?
B :  Mm two .
D :  Two ? Antek .
C :  But you can't make a remote control without them , because
B :  Because we got
D :  Nay that that that's true , that's true . They're definitely needed . So
A :  No , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is yeah .
D :  we put it on a two ?
C :  Yes .
D :  The remote control has got a really trendy look .
C :  Yes . A one .
D :  Maarten .
A :  Yeah , uh a t I think a two . Yeah yeah , y i it's hard to say from this picture .
B :  Well .
D :  Yeah .
C :  We we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Ever , yeah . Guido .
A :  But I do think it's more
B :  Uh , I will I will make it a three , because uh yeah . I I th
A :  But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful .
D :  Yeah , uh I agree . I agree .
C :  Yes .
A :  So so I think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the
B :  Yeah . True , yeah .
D :  I was planning to give it a two , uh where I give the not ugly uh oh , yeah , that's true . You agree on the two ?
A :  A th a three .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
A :  I i uh when you compare to the
D :  Great . Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .
A :  Uh uh what's the difference with
D :  Uh , I copied that one .
D :  Well , uh forget that . Um
A :  Okay .
D :  Go away . Remote control has got innovative technology implanted .
B :  No . We're not well , maybe the the the on the side .
C :  No .
A :  No .
C :  No , not L_C_D_ , so .
A :  Yeah , but we uh you mean the rubber stuff ? Yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . And I don't u also it's also really not innovative , it's more
D :  Yeah , and the light .
B :  And the light maybe .
C :  But that that's not innovative . Lights lights are
B :  But
D :  Well , I g
D :  It's not seven ?
A :  No , six . Or seven maybe , yeah . Or six .
B :  Well , six .
B :  No , six .
C :  Six .
D :  Why uh why not a seven ?
B :  Six .
A :  Yeah , mine is seven .
C :  Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative , but it but it
B :  Yeah .
D :  How ?
A :  Uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe
C :  With the lights it it's it's kind of future
B : 
A :  No , I think I think actually it's a seven maybe , but there's nothing innovative about it .
D :  Yeah , you think the lights are innovative ?
D :  Well , it's n true . Uh , I agree , m but
C :  But still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the with
B :  Innovative in generally or just f original for
D :  I'll
D :  Yeah , you you didn't draw the docking station .
C :  Yes . The docking station is a is a little bit innovative . It's a part of the remote . And with the speaker on the there's also a speaker .
A :  N no no , t .
D :  Yeah , it it's I think I think with its
B :  A docking station is innova
A :  Yeah , I mean the dock station , but but uh , I think the the docking station , it's gonna be a kind of a problem . But
D :  I think more m
B :  Okay .
D :  Uh that that's n
A :  Well , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . Well I i yeah . No ?
C :  Okay .
D :  No uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we
A :  Okay , for now it's a six or a seven uh , sev six maybe , because
D :  It's it's a six .
B :  Six .
C :  But the retrieval or the
D :  That m f Yeah , for the retrieval function .
A :  Yeah , but I don't I don't know if it's very inno yeah .
D :  Yeah . I think that's very innovative for a remote control .
C :  Yes , how would you innovate a remote control more ?
A :  Yeah , v
A :  Yeah , more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and no no , you know what I mean . You have must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your yeah . Yeah , it's that's that's think about it la later on and uh
C :  To put it on your head .
D :  Yeah sure , but
D :  But I d I definitely don't think it's a five , but
D :  Remote control is easy to use .
A :  Yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , a two .
C :  Yes .
D :  I think a two . Yeah ?
A :  Yeah , it's good .
B :  More two .
D :  Come on . The remote control hasn't got uh .
A :  No , I would have seen that one before . Oh , you skipped one uh
D :  I've just filled uh
A :  Uh , here .
D :  Go away .
C :  You like the buttons .
D :  I found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten .
A :  Remote control will be bought by
D :  It will be bought by people under the age of forty .
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah . Definitely .
B :  Yes .
A :  Well
C :  In in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ?
D :  No no no . No , just if they if they buy it .
A :  Uh , just in general . Yeah , a two .
C :  We don't know . But
A :  Yeah , but I think I think two .
D :  Yeah , what do you think ?
B :  Yeah , I think two , yeah . I agree . Two .
D :  Antek ?
C :  Yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly .
A :  Uh , that is not the question . It's just w it will be bought by people under forty .
D :  No , that's no comparison .
A :  Yeah , you can yeah , you can be very picky about it .
D :  And I don't mean two people .
C :  This is just guessing .
A :  Ah yeah , just make it we'll make it a two .
C :  Make it a two .
D :  W w
C :  When it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu
D :  Right , the rem
D :  The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan .
A :  Oh no .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , you have make an slogan is quite obvious .
B :  We don't have the slogan though .
D :  Oh , the slogan . Can we see the slogan ?
A :  Oh the oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . Yeah , you can put that on the side if if we would like to .
B :  The logo .
C :  A logo .
B :  Underneath it or something .
C :  Yes , uh encrypted uh with
A :  Yeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . Maybe a three this time .
D :  Are we gonna do that ?
B :  A three . Three .
B :  Yeah , a three .
C :  Yes .
D :  Three ? I agree .
D :  Because of the slogan Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users .
A :  And uh
A :  Uh , it's a one or a two .
B :  Yeah , two .
C :  Yes .
D :  Two ? Two . Alright .
A :  Yeah , make it a two .
B :  Two .
D :  We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . Four , five , seven , nine . Forget that . Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six .
D :  Twenty six .
D :  It's a two point six .
A :  It's not that bad . Yeah , and that's mostly the inno when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two ,
D :  Alright , we yeah .
D :  Yeah . True .
A :  which is uh quite a great score . Okay . Uh , this is was uh the evaluation ?
D :  This was my evaluation . So
A :  Because I I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has
D :  We did a pretty nice job until now .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Um , is this your
C :  Is there something after this uh meeting ? Or
D :  Whatever .
D :  Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire .
B :  No .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Still opened or uh
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , finance . Because um
B :  Shoot .
A :  I received uh a spreadsheet .
D :  A five . A five .
A :  Yeah , but I uh actually don't need this presentation , I guess . Oh .
D :  Doesn't matter .
A :  I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because I didn't really fin uh I have a .
A :  Didn't really finish it .
A :  Well , we uh We'll see . We'll stumble upon some problems .
D :  We probably will .
A :  I probably have already opened it here .
A :  try it again . First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list .
A :  But let's let's st start with beginning . We include one battery . I i uh I'll explain its Uh , the the components are listed over here . Uh , price is given . We um yeah , we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . And then uh , we'll uh calcula Don't watch the number yet . I don't know if it's filled in properly . Okay , we need one battery . One battery . I think one battery is enough . We don't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . A s okay , this this is a p first problem . Uh , I think
D :  The amount , yeah .
C :  Yes .
A :  we should know how many
A :  simple chips , regular chips
C :  Uh it's it's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it .
A :  Okay .
A :  But
C :  The simple chip is e enough I I think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh
D :  I don't know
A :  Where did we find this information ? Was it
D :  I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really .
C :  No , uh I
A :  I think it was uh your job in the first uh meet Uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . But do you th you do you know what chip we need ?
B :  No .
C :  Yes , my my my uh
D :  Yeah .
C :  The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip maybe .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And how do you know ? I mean , you got that email . Did it point out what to use them for ?
C :  Bec No , the they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it .
A :  Maybe you can uh look it up right now .
A :  Okay , but okay . When we don't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what then it would be a simple chip . And with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip .
C :  Then it's a simple chip .
C :  Yes , I I I s I
D :  Alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess .
A :  Okay . Yeah , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . The sample sensor sample speaker . What is it m is that the speaker we were t I don't know what it is .
C :  That will be enough for future uh recommendations .
C :  I don't know it uh either .
D :  I don't know .
A :  Okay , we went for the double-curved case
C :  Yes .
A :  made out of plastic
A :  and rubber .
A :  And with a special colour .
A :  I guess that's what we were
B :  Well , special colour . .
A :  Yeah , I don't know about the special colour , but I think w uh
C :  Otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour .
D :  I don't know if it's very special .
B :  I don't
A :  Yeah , I think we uh we have special colours .
B :  Mm okay .
C :  Standard rubber .
D :  Alright , that's okay .
A :  Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them . Uh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , isn't it ?
C :  St
B :  Whoa , it's a little
C :  Yes .
A :  Well that's bit of a problem , because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet .
B :  That's huge .
B :  No . We have the simplest buttons .
D :  No .
C :  No , it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . If you use a scroll-wheel
A :  Yeah .
D :  I don't think so , because it says amount . The the the yellow row is the amount of
A :  Ah .
A :  Yeah , it wouldn't
A :  Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost I don't know .
C :  Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . You can have f four kind of push-buttons .
B :  Uh , one til nine . Is that one or is that nine buttons ?
C :  Rubber . You can have uh
A :  And I count them like this .
A :  One two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . Because Oh , this is oh , this is one , okay . Twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , I uh rated them as uh um
B :  Yeah .
D :  To n that's total of four buttons .
A :  as uh uh uh separate buttons . Yes . And plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen .
C :  Different , yes .
D :  I think that
D :  Eighteen . One two three four five , si
C :  Why is that so uh expensive .
A :  Yeah , I don't understand . Y I do I don't get the point , because it's would be
A :  s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons .
B :  Is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ?
D :  Fifty cents for one single stupid button .
C :  So , whe when you so then it
B :  No way .
A :  Well , okay , well well let's make it just one .
C :  It's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of
A :  Here , now it's now it's already s shall we just
D :  Yeah , exactly . Yeah .
A :  give our own interpretation to , because else we would really have a problem . It would be impossible to make it
D :  I can't I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . Really .
B :  It's way
C :  When you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . Board . And then throw it
A :  And and less buttons than this isn't possible . This is the most simple yeah , it is possible , but I've never seen one before .
D :  Yeah , yeah ,
B :  No , no no .
C :  But whe
C :  I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , but but
D :  No , really .
A :  Yeah , without the numbers . That's possible .
B :  Yeah , uh
A :  Yeah , we could skip the numbers .
D :  Yeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really .
B :  That's still four .
C :  Uh , it's it's still for little children . They can handle that remote control , but but it isn't fo
D :  Yeah .
A :  Then uh , teletext would also be im impossible .
C :  Yes , it's for it's li uh it's just for a little
B :  Yeah , that's no option , that's no option .
A :  Okay , we'll we'll just okay . But then still , when we there's no room for a docking station or something . Tha w Le let's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements . We'll give the buttons special colour . We'll give them a special form . Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess .
B :  A special colour , why a special colour ?
A :  Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . I think that's the what they mean by a special colour . I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do , making it
B :  But wha what s what special ?
C :  Otherwise , it
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  I don't think the special form is really true .
C :  Otherwise it would be the
B :  Uh , yeah .
C :  Special form also , it says .
A :  Yeah , special material r also , because i has rubber . And the buttons have to be rubber .
D :  Is it ?
C :  What is the normal material ?
D :  Yeah , I dunno .
B :  Plastic .
C :  Sh yeah .
B :  Plastic , I think .
C :  Classic ? Oh , plastic .
B :  Plastic .
D :  Plastic .
A :  'Kay , but the problem now is that the
A :  There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents .
B :  Yeah .
C :  But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station yes . And and but we don't have to tell it , but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station .
A :  Separately .
B :  Se no no no .
A :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah , but I do like the idea , but we yeah . It uh but it then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need .
D :  No .
C :  No , but you otherwise you can't retrieve it .
D :  Yeah , I really don't get it . I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents .
A :  I think we can agree on this . I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked .
A :  'Cause I think we uh Yeah , I think that's what what what they uh mean
D :  Yeah , yep .
C :  But for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station .
D :  I think so , too .
D :  Oh , I don't know .
A :  But can we find out uh about uh this chips ? Because when we don't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip .
B :  And then we can get a docking station .
A :  And maybe then we can do something extra . Oh , n uh oh , still oh , it's gonna get more expensive with . Two . Then we have some money left . We can put then
C :  For
C :  For two Euros .
A :  We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something .
D :  Uh why ? I mean i i if you if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it .
A :  Yeah , well who knows . Or a little bit of tin titanium .
B :  But what what can we do
A :  Yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . That's also maybe an idea .
B :  But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ?
A :  Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us . Maybe is that that's nice to know .
B :  If if i
B :  Regular chip and because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example .
A :  Yeah , bu bu but when we yeah , but when we skip when we um when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , because that was our our special feature .
D :  I like the hand dynamo part .
D :  We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . I mean
B :  Yeah .
B :  We'll go back uh tomorrow .
A :  Yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe
D :  Wi wi without recharge
A :  It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material .
D :  Yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it . I mean ,
D :  it has a shape . Of course it has a shape , but i i
A :  Yeah , but for two Euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip , then two Euros isn't even possible .
D :  Why should that not be possible ?
A :  Yeah , then because then we'd thirty cents left .
D :  No , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip .
A :  Yeah , but yeah , I don't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip .
B :  That's the question . If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f
D :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , and w and and we uh need f and what is this ? Sample sensor sample speaker .
C :  It isn't in my information , so I don't know it uh either . It isn't in my information , I uh I I've got a
C :  schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or
A : 
A :  You can look at it for s presentation .
A :  S technical functions ?
B :  No .
C :  Uh I've got here in uh I will put a I will put a page on it .
B :  No no , they were uh mine , yeah .
A :  Oh .
C :  When my mouse works again .
A :  Oh , oh oh .
A :  Hey .
A :  Oh .
C :  My mouse is uh
D :  Dead .
C :  Yes .
D :  Reanimate it .
C :  Oh .
B :  Died .
C :  Ah , I've got it . I will put uh
C :  my email on the
C :  the network .
D :  What the hell are these ?
C :  It's on it .
D :  Oh , whatever .
B :  Yeah , it's open .
A :  Mm .
A :  I don't think here it's in here already .
B :  It's circuit board .
B :  It's only just basics for for
A :  It's nothing about s yeah .
C :  Yes .
B :  At the end circuit there is an infrared LED .
D :  This isn't helpful .
A :  No .
A :  But i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . Which one was it ?
B :  Components design .
A :  Functional requirements ?
C :  Um
D :  No , that was my presentation .
B :  Components design maybe .
B :  N on top .
C :  Yes , that was mine .
A :  Ah .
A :  Ah yes , it was the second one .
C :  But that was my second
D :  It's already open .
A :  Yeah , it was your second your first presentation .
D :  It's at the bottom .
B :  Working design .
A :  Sorry ?
D :  It's uh at your task bar .
B :  Yeah , but it's the the other one .
D :  Oh .
C :  Mm
B :  Was it working design or components design ?
A :  Uh , this is n this is not this n that's not the right one . I don't oh .
D :  Sorry .
D :  Okay , sorry .
A :  No , this is the other one . Or maybe something is uh maybe there's something abo in in these
B :  Chip set .
C :  But this is the same uh
C :  This is o only the possibilities .
A :  Here .
C :  Yeah .
C :  We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip .
D :  Yeah , nice . I it doesn't say anything .
B :  The display requires an advanced chip .
A :  You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires Okay , so we only need a simple chip .
C :  Ah , okay .
B :  Requires .
C :  With the light .
B :  Little lights . Yeah , but that that's just the same as the the LED .
A :  No no , that's just a simple chip .
D :  That's not needed .
A :  A scroll-wheel it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . So , we don't need any of them .
D :  A display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . For showing text . I don't think that uh just a l a little light
C :  L_C_D_ .
B :  Yeah .
B :  No .
B :  I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay .
D :  Yeah , I agree .
A :  And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ?
C :  Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I guess so too .
B :  Yeah , true .
D :  Next channel .
B :  Well , that's not too what we want .
D :  No . Well , we might want it , but
A :  Okay .
C :  All in twelve Euros .
A :  Back to the costs .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Twelve Euros and fifty cents .
A :  So we're gonna use the simple chip .
B :  So , simple chip is okay .
D :  Great . Delete . Yeah .
C :  And the lights . Where uh are the lights ?
B :  Yeah , lights , yeah , there's no
D :  Well , there're three , I guess .
B :  category .
A :  Nah , there is some money left to be spent .
B :  Can we do it wi within two two Euro ?
D :  I think we can make a docking station . Yeah .
A :  Okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? But I mean it isn't it hasn't got any innovative technology , we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway , I think . I don't I don't see any possibility to do so , because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy . But what w is there some extra maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But it's original .
D :  No , that's true .
A :  Instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know , so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore . Maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it
D :  M bu
C :  But but sometimes you put a
A :  Yeah , you leave the p yeah , I know , but still I they will think about that . I mean if you u
C :  Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking .
A :  The uh it's made for s people well , the they don't if it was uh uh r useless technology , they wouldn't put it uh as a possibility . And i it it th th the the target the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking . Because I think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . Because it's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot
C :  Uh solar cells are useless .
D :  Or the hand dynamo dynamo
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries . I've never seen it before in a remote control .
D :  Yeah , but but if we ca
D :  I don't know if
B :  But then we could make a docking station .
D :  Five minutes .
A :  No , we we we can't make a docking station anyway .
D :  That's not true .
A :  Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one we can still make
D :  We can make a docking station for two thirty .
B :  Wow , w why no li Look at now , we got two
D :  Two thirty .
C :  Fo for a docking station . With a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it .
B :  two thirty left . Ca can't we make a docking station of that ?
D :  We can make a docking station . Sure .
D :  Sure .
B :  I don't know .
D :  The power device is is i i is very cheap . That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever .
A :  Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control .
C :  Wi with a button to
B :  Well , we we uh
D :  So .
C :  wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . Uh , so it's uh wireless technology .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff .
A :  I don't think it's realistic for you to do so .
D :  Well then it's a useless project .
C :  Look at the case , the case the case of of uh of uh
A :  Oh , because we
B :  Yeah , then we don't have any innovation things .
A :  We well look at all the special stuff we have . Colour a the colours are special , the form is special . It th this is whole concept . Uh maybe it with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing .
D :  Can't we uh
D :  Can't we say fifteen Euros ?
A :  Uh , no .
D :  No , sta yeah I mean
C :  No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros .
D :  No .
B :  No , we only make less profit of it .
C :  It's the
D :  You can sell for twenty seven and a half .
D :  Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs .
B :  No .
A :  Yeah , I don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a
A :  Uh uh I I I I still fee I also feel this concept of making it kinetic ,
A :  because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control .
D :  I don't think
C :  Maybe we can uh can do it both . Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic .
D :  No .
A :  No , that wouldn't n no .
D :  Thirteen twenty .
A :  Yeah , and it is also not a good it's not you have to really do it only kinetic , you don't want it to think about batteries anymore .
D :  And I think only
C :  Yes , but when it's then when it then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty .
D :  Yeah , but only kinetic , then you gotta
A :  No no .
A :  Yeah , it's great .
D :  You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really .
A :  No no no . No no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . When you use it your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it
B : 
C :  You asked for three d
C :  No , that's n that's not true . Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time .
D :  No .
A :  It We can make it yeah no . Becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it
C :  Yes , solar cells are also stated .
A :  Yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells .
C :  Why don't we use solar cells then ?
A :  Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and
C :  That's true .
D :  Yeah , it's funny for a week . I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating .
A :  Yeah , but you don't have to . Trust me . The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens .
D :  No , I I don't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously .
A :  Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what that would just have a lack of key features , you know . You m have to put something on your box . You have to make people buy it and uh
C :  Oui .
A :  We can really can do the docking thing , uh it's not yeah , uh we can do it , but it's would be a easy way out .
C :  You can do it for fifty cents .
D :  Well , we've got more than fifty Cents .
C :  The c The case the case alone is is is uh
A :  Okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , because uh we only have a minute left or so .
C :  the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro .
C :  Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station .
A :  No no , it's not possible .
A :  Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it's this is then then our concept is ready .
B :  Cheap remote control .
A :  Yeah , we make some extra profit of it .
D :  Yeah . No , we won't , but that's um something else . No , this not gonna sell . No .
C :  But now
B :  It w it won't tell , but
A :  Huh , any ideas ?
D :  Of course not .
B :  No , uh , n no
C :  Great . It's great .
B :  Yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . You have to do it over .
C :  Our remote control .
D :  We come back tomorrow , okay ?
B :  Yeah . the
A :  No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left . I mean we're gonna it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel .
C :  Yes .
C :  Seventy Euros .
B :  No , but no .
A :  That's what it's makes it special .
A :  Yeah , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some
A :  just to give it some extra special feature , and uh I know it will work , but uh it's it's an They're they're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to
A :  to make it happen .
C :  Why not a hand dynamo then ?
A :  Okay , well we leave it like this . Then it's c then we're yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  We can't do anything else . Warning , finish meeting now .
C :  We're done .
A :  Okay , project e uh well , we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet .
C :  Is this it ?
D :  Yeah , sure .
C :  Okay .
D :  No , we can't .
A :  Yeah , we have to Yeah , it's
B :  No .
D :  Yes , yes . Celebration . I don't see why , but
C :  Yes .
C :  Where's the champagne ?
D :  I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest .
B :  Yeah ?
C :  I don't uh hear a bell .
D :  No , not yet .
D :  Alright , I'll see you guys in a minute .
B :  We can do it here then .
C :  Bye .
D :  I don't think so .
B :  Can we can't we do it here ?
D :  I don't know . I don't I don't think so .
C :  Uh-huh .
C :  Just fill that one in .
B :  Yeah , we're doing now . But it's .
B :  Oh , okay .
A :  Uh , I don't know .
B :  Nice .
