A :  So uh good morning . I see you all find your places . Is everybody sitting on the right place ? Yeah ? I guess so . So
D :  Morning .
B :  Morning .
C :  Morning .
D :  Yep .
A :  Let's see .
A :  First I will introduce myself . I don't know if uh if everybody knows me , so I'm Bart , hello . Hello . Bart . Hello . Hello . Bart . Welcome .
D :  My name's Frank .
B :  I'm .
D :  Thank you .
A :  Uh let's see . Uh let's start off um with a little presentation .
A :  Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting . You can see there are a few cameras here . They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it . So is there a project documents folder ? There are some notes in it already I see , some documents . Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off .
A :  Is being modified by the administrator . Uh okay . Let's do it read only .
D :  Hmm , that's interesting .
A :  Well I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction . Uh it's a company in uh electronics . We put fashion in electronics , uh we make it work , uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . I'm Bart the project manager so I'll direct you through the project .
A :  This is our agenda .
A :  Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing .
A :  Uh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or Let's see .
A :  Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . I dunno it's not a lot of work , but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down . Uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . Um have you all seen the corporate website already ? Yeah . Have you seen any flaws in it ? I think I found one . No ?
D :  Sure .
D :  Yep . Visit it .
B :  Yep .
B :  Hmm ?
D :  Can't say I paid much attention to it , but
A :  I can
A :  see if it works this way . No , it doesn't work here . Okay no problem . But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction . Real Remote is not really the company we're we are , but it's just a little fault . Um okay , what are we going to do ? Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look . And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original .
D :  Oh yeah .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  And we've got our User Interface Designer . He's also uh
B :  Yep .
A :  That's about the new remote control .
A :  Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design .
A :  I had some role indications on here .
A :  But I think you know it already by yourself . The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation . So that's a bit what you're going to do . But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings .
A :  Then we've got our first tool training . We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . Here are some functions . You can save . N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little
A :  uh piece of drawing . A blank new document for each person . Uh select a pen , eraser . Capture we don't have to do anything with . Uh then we've got our pen . This pen . It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of . You can also select the current colour and the line width . But then first you have to select the pen function . But we're going to work with it in a minute . So okay . Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Uh then
A :  a short thing about documents . We've got our shared folder , uh project project what was it ? Project documents I think . But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Here is a simple tool bar . It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . You can switch between the different drawings .
A :  And then we're going to try out the white board .
A :  So as you can see we g all going to draw a animal . Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it . Mouse wasn't running away .
D :  That was interesting .
A :  Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ? No . Okay . We're going to uh draw animal .
D :  Innocent .
A :  And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . Uh there's I can start from now . I will . You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good .
B :  Okay .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up . So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate . Then the line width . I think seven will be nice . Now you'll see my drawing capabilities . These are not very much , but uh
A :  Uh , see you have to do it real slow .
A :  Oh
B :  Sure .
A :  Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin , but I think his nose has to be a little bit But it's close .
D :  I'm thinking about a swordfish .
A :  So what yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish . Yeah , he hasn't got an eye .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B : 
A :  Woah . Now we've got another function . We've got the eraser . And then you can undo
D :  .
A :  this easily .
D :  Meat .
A :  Ah it's okay . And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics . Uh is
A :  They've got no text tool , no .
A :  Uh .
A :  Okay . This is typically a undo action , I think . Pen .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe you have to hold it a bit
A :  upside-down . I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . But I don't know , I'm just trying .
A :  This is not my work , okay . Maybe you have to use
D :  Hmm .
A :  Oh .
A :  Uh . I think it's a it wants to draw a another animal ? I don't know .
A :  It lives for the fun .
A :  So
A :  It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin . It lives for the fun . So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . Go ahead .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Thank you .
D :  Okay .
D :  Gonna use a different line width .
D :  And I'm gonna draw in black .
D :  There . 'Kay , I'm not much of an artist , but here we go .
A :  Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width , I think . Because this is going a lot better than uh I did .
B :  Hmm .
B :  A sheep .
D :  Mm .
D :  Okay . This is my um Hmm .
D :  Sheep .
A :  It's nice .
D :  With of course
D :  little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts .
A :  Uh .
A :  It's a real dead sheep , yeah . For recognition , yeah , I see .
D :  There .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere . On just a
D :  'Kay .
D :  They are
D :  Come on .
D :  You have to go really slow when you're writing .
A :  Yeah .
D :  They're brilliant animal animals . And that's just a little me thingy .
D :  So .
D :  Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer .
B :  Okay . Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head , but mm
A :  Nice .
B :  Let's see .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh .
B :  Okay .
D :  Interesting .
A :  Sweet .
B :  Yeah . You know what that is ?
D :  A rabbit ? Garfield . Yeah .
B :  Or who ?
C :  Garfield .
B :  Ah okay , yeah .
B :  Just a
B :  Mm . Guess .
B :  So uh
B :  Yeah . That's enough .
B :  Um , you say a blank , or
A :  Yeah , just a blank sheet .
B :  Okay .
C :  Well I was gonna draw a cat too , so . I'll just try something else . Something different than Garfield .
A :  No .
C :  Mine is a bit more skinny .
A :  Yeah , it's pretty skinny cat .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But uh
D :  And the most interesting tail .
A :  Is your cat , or did you find him on the street ?
C :  Well , it's supposed to be a cat . I like cats because uh
C :  they are uh
C :  independent .
A :  Ah .
C :  The pen .
C :  So .
A :  Okay . That's pretty clear . So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . It's pretty uh easy .
D :  Yeah .
C :  The pen .
A :  'Kay . S haunted white board . So we've got the tool uh introduction . We
D :  We're being haunted .
A :  move along to the project finance . Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price . Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros . Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . Uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . Um but that's all in the later stadium .
A :  Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . It won't work . So just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros .
A :  So that's leads us to our little discussion . We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . So I'm gonna sit down , I think . It's easier . I've got a message . Five minutes . Okay , that's uh good timing .
D :  Yeah , you got a message .
B :  Five minutes , okay .
D :  So just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ?
B :  Mm ?
A :  Uh maybe you have to say the magic word .
D :  Yeah . Right .
A :  Does it do anything ?
D :  No .
A :  Maybe you have to just clap it down ?
A :  Mm back up again .
A :  No slide show . Hmm .
D :  It's off now .
A :  It's off . Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah . You'll be okay , I think .
D :  Well , it was on , but
A :  Well it's those laptops .
D :  Ah , there we are .
A :  Nice . Okay . But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ? No ? You ?
B :  Mm .
B :  Oh really ?
B :  Huh .
D :  Well , we have a
C :  No , me neither .
B :  It's a
D :  kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player . And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .
A :  Ah yeah .
A :  Yep . Yeah I've I've got one at home . And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor . So that's a pretty handy um
B :  Sure . Yeah .
B :  Okay , yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  Oh really .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Oh .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  thing .
A :  Um but only the
A :  I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . It's uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  Oh .
A :  That's good to remember .
D :  So I think you can take minutes again .
A :  Yeah , that's nice , I think . So we've we want different functions
D :  Since it's your job .
D :  Yeah .
A :  uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs . So that uh that's something we have to find out , I think .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah . But that would be really good if we could do that .
A :  And other functions for a remote control ?
A :  Maybe we can make it uh uh
D :  Um .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Think it has to be shock proof
B :  Sure , yeah .
A :  Shock proof .
D :  my remote control tends to fall a lot .
B :  Waterproof , or uh
A :  Sure .
D :  So
B :  Uh , you never no know uh , I w I mean uh
A :  Waterproof .
A :  Okay . So these are our um a few things we can think of . Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Yeah , one other little thing . Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it .
D :  So you can see
A :  That's a battery stays .
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  how much is left in the battery .
D :  But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Uh .
D :  But maybe just a little LED , I don't know .
A :  That's an idea as well . Other ideas ?
A :  Quick ideas .
C :  Nope . They were all mentioned , so
B :  Mm .
A :  Okay . Any questions about this uh presentation ? Kick off presentation .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Um .
D :  Nope , don't think so .
A :  No ?
A :  Okay , then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder ,
A :  and then we can all work .
A :  Finish meeting now . Okay . And we can all work uh on our own projects .
D :  Okay .
D :  Aye sir .
A :  Okay then I'll meet you in about a half an hour , I think . So good luck .
D :  Half an hour .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Yep .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Everybody found his place again ? Yeah ? That's nice . Okay so this is our second meeting . And uh still failing ?
D :  Yes .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh now we're going um into the functional design . Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design .
A :  So that we can move onto the second uh phase . But first this phase . Um first an announcement . There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . So
A :  There's our ghost mouse again . That that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that's because of this uh
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  It's in wing C_ and E_ . So it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . But it's going to be cold anyway , so I don't think you're gonna need it . Then our agenda . Now first the opening . Uh this time I will take the minutes .
D :  No .
A :  Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you . Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me .
A :  And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . So we've got forty minutes for all of it . So I suggest um let's start with the first presentation . Um who wants to be first ?
D :  Yes .
D :  Think I'll go first .
A :  Okay . So
A :  Just maybe it's easier if you um Yeah I think you will tell your presentation as well . Just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about .
D :  'Kay . My name is Freek Van Ponnen . I'm the Market Expert . But you already knew that .
D :  Um I've done some research . We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . We had one hundred of these uh test subjects .
D :  Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved .
D :  Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . Um remotes are being considered ugly . F uh seventy five percent of the um
D :  people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . So
D :  Um in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control .
D :  And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room .
B :  Mm .
D :  some things .
D :  Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . So these are the most
D :  most uh important functions on a remote control . Then there are some one-time use function . That's what I like to call them . That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance .
D :  Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour .
D :  Then these are the This is the market . Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six .
D :  Um
D :  Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . Um they like to use new f new functions . But they also are very critical . They won't spend their money very easily . So
D :  Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market .
D :  They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier .
D :  Um
D :  What I think this indicates for our um
D :  design . I think we should make a remote for the future . And this means we would
D :  um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five .
D :  Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable .
D :  Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design .
D :  Um
D :  The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ .
D :  Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice .
D :  And the functionality
D :  As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote .
D :  Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . They shouldn't break down easily .
D :  Um
D :  Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be
D :  and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep .
D :  So you'd know where it is in the room . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in .
D :  Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . This was um
D :  mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . But up till forty five it remains feasible . This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .
A :  Okay .
D :  That would be all .
A :  Thank you . So anybody have um any questions until now ?
D :  Any questions ?
A :  About functional requirements ? Okay that's clear .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  No .
A :  Now to the second .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Uh okay . Um I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . Um
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah you can take your time . We've got uh plenty of time , so
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm ?
D :  Yeah you should go to the top thingy . Slide show . Oh yeah .
B :  Oh .
B :  Uh .
A :  Yeah . There it is . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Um yeah . I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it , Um about uh interface but uh Uh
B :  Yeah I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo . So um
B :  But uh it must be uh user-friendly . So um uh you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh Yeah . Uh uh uh Yeah . In one um remote control . But um
A :  One remote .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um yeah . Got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control .
B :  Um few uh buttons but uh This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . Um uh people uh don't like it , uh so um
B :  Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . So uh like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that . Um
B :  My personal uh preferences um . Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . So um
B :  Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um
B :  Uh this the remote control uh and uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh I dunno um And um here you've got a s kind of a display .
A : 
B :  It's a touchscreen . So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh . And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device .
B :  So um this button is for a D_V_D_ or So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device . So uh that's uh my uh idea about it . Um yeah and
A :  Hmm .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Uh let's see . Uh yeah . So a touchscreen . Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah . Everybody uh have to use it so
B :  Uh ol even even old people um young people . So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . So uh Um
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Uh yeah .
B :  That was uh my uh part of it . So
A :  Okay . Anybody has questions about the technical functions ?
C :  Well I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros .
B :  N I I don't think so . Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something . Uh it's just uh um one colo Uh yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Touchscreen .
B :  Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago . Uh you got uh yeah quite an uh
B :  a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh for
B :  uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh . So it's possible .
A :  Huh .
D :  Hmm .
A :  'Kay . That's nice . Uh
D :  Well it would certainly make a fancy design .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  But the It wouldn't be very robust . It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it .
D :  So
D :  That is true .
A :  That's right . Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ? Uh And then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design .
B :  Yeah that's true .
D :  We would have to look into that .
B :  Uh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That's .
C :  Okay .
A :  I think it's going to Uh it's not too much . Okay .
C :  Okay I've got a presentation about the working design . Um first about how it works . It's really simple of course . Everybody knows how a remote works . The user presses a button . The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is .
C :  So we've got um the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ .
C :  It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button .
C :  Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high .
C :  And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product .
C :  So it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself .
C :  That's it .
A :  Okay . Thank you .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh
A :  Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements .
A :  Um that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . Um that's because uh it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
A :  So it has to be simple . Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control .
A :  Um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well .
A :  Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers .
A :  Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert . Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our
A :  uh remote control , and the other way round . And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . So I suggest
A :  let's have a discussion on the control functions .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?
A :  Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . And new T_V_s will have internet access on them . But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access
D :  within the next like twenty years is very slim .
B :  Yeah .
D :  In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it .
D :  I'm pretty much against it .
A :  Against the no teletext ?
B :  Mm .
D :  Yes .
A :  Um
D :  Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like
D :  pretty small .
D :  But I mean if I s if I see this , it's I think we're just gonna go for another
A :  Yeah it's it is
B :  forty
A :  Standard remote .
A :  No I think we can
D :  and not innovative
D :  remote control .
A :  I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned . Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now .
D :  Yes but it's not the biggest part of the
D :  market .
A :  No .
D :  And besides that , they're not very critical so I mean they don't really care
D :  what the remote control is like . They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .
A :  But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it . So let's try it .
D :  No .
D :  I think that would be the case in the
D :  sixteen to forty five age category .
D :  because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control .
B :  Yeah .
D :  People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work , but
D :  as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I think that if we're If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ?
D :  So
A :  Yeah . It's a big success .
C :  Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . We just
D :  I haven't heard of it .
A :  Very big success . Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Uh . I think so as well .
B :  Mm .
C :  change our focus on the project , and I think
C :  we can uh we can sell this .
A :  Uh I simply think um
A :  uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people .
A :  And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . 'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important . Volume selection , power and teletext . Okay . Um
D :  Yes .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  But obviously the board tends to disagree .
A :  No we we haven't voted yet , so Uh I think teletext can be uh
A :  um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't
A :  higher the the cost , because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but I don't think it will be a problem .
A :  Or is teletext a
B :  But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . So it's Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , also .
A :  Yeah . So I suggest uh
D :  I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .
B :  It's
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Is anybody um really against teletext ?
C :  No .
A :  No ? Just that , that we just keep the teletext .
A :  I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles .
A :  Maybe we can
A :  make that um
A :  another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .
B :  Yeah yeah .
C :  Uh that's a good idea .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Um so I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . Um
A :  Functionality should be few buttons , you said .
D :  Yes .
A :  I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So to keep it simple .
D :  I don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause
D :  Well might be .
B :  If it's only for televi Yeah .
D :  But I mean it , if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel ,
B :  Yeah .
A :  No .
B :  Yeah .
D :  volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but
A :  Yeah .
A :  But do you need
D :  I think if you if you only l
B :  So we can s we can skip the display , so uh we don't need it .
A :  But do you need the buttons for one to zero . Maybe c we can
D :  Nah .
B :  Uh
D :  Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . I think many people like to use that . 'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .
A :  Maybe we can use uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  No , maybe we can implement the scroll button ?
A :  Or a joystick like ?
B :  Mm .
A :  There are other ways too . Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  That's true but um
D :  I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . And so you would need like
D :  the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it .
D :  And I dunno if many channels would
D :  do have that . If many T_V_s have that .
C :  Yeah . And besides that it's um If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . They're not used to using scroll buttons . So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .
B :  Mm .
A :  That's right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  the numbers yeah . Yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it . But I think there won't be very much buttons . Or there don't have to be a lot .
B :  Yeah .
D :  But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on
D :  um having as few buttons as possible . 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . I don't think there's much to be gained in that area .
B :  Hmm .
A :  The number of buttons ? I think it's very important in the in the design .
D :  Yeah .
A :  You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
D :  That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ .
A :  To operate only the T_V_ yeah .
D :  'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required .
D :  There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either .
A :  No .
B :  No .
A :  So .
D :  So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here .
A :  'Kay . So we can
D :  That would that would cost a a big marketing
A :  Yeah .
A :  That's right .
D :  which was
D :  one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot .
A :  Yeah . So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station .
A :  Uh uh like other functions .
D :  Maybe .
A :  Instead of f of less buttons .
D :  yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and
D :  But I don't think we should spend very much time in that .
A :  Mm . No . Do you think the docking station will
A :  uh is allowed in the budget we have ?
C :  It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy . And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible yeah .
A :  'Cause it can be
B :  No .
A :  No .
A :  Yeah . Because I think that's uh
B :  No .
A :  That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station or very That's a nice requirement .
C :  Yes .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Docking station .
C :  So we're just gonna focus on the extras ?
A :  I think so .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into
D :  what elderly people like to have in a
A :  Yeah .
D :  like to have extra in a new remote control .
A :  That's a good point . Um
A :  You said they easily get lost as well .
D :  Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something .
D :  Yeah that was what I suggested . You have it on Yeah you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station . And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Hm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So audio signal should be possible as well . I think it's not too expensive . Uh another
D :  So you know where it is .
B :  No .
A :  point is the L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , because
C :  Y i um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause
A :  Yeah . It will be too much as well .
C :  it's uh
B :  Mm .
D :  I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . Which would tell you what it does .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , but
A :  Based .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  Just the L_C_D_ . Oh just the normal screen .
D :  Just a small screen with two
A :  That's a good idea . So Some extra info . Feedback .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think that's a good idea as well .
B :  Yeah .
D :  But I dunno if that would
A :  As the small screen .
D :  that would fit into the
D :  costs .
A :  Extra button info .
A :  I think that should be possible as well . Um let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions
A :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
A :  And default materials .
A :  I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . So that doesn't really matter . So I think we nee
D :  No .
B :  Mm .
D :  I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than
D :  youngsters .
A :  Uh let's um specify the target group . Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh what do we want ? If we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can
D :  I think
A :  target the real elderly people .
D :  I think that would be a If we should do something like that it would be a , I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And I think , I think there would be a good market for it .
A :  So that's the
D :  If we're able to really bring an innovative product .
A :  Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example .
D :  Yeah the really
A :  Yeah . Sixty .
B :  Mm .
D :  I'd have to look into that a little more .
A :  Okay . And different cultures . Are we
C :  Well I don't think they have different television sets uh
B :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
C :  in uh every country .
A :  No .
B :  No .
C :  'Cause
A :  We've got five minutes left just now . Small warning .
B :  So 'Kay .
D :  'Kay . And with uh the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to
A :  Should
D :  adapt it to different cultures .
A :  Yeah . In different languages , you know . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  or you have to put a language button in it , but that will be a bit unnecessary I think . It's better to put it on different markets with it all . Okay . So that's the the target . Uh then a few small things .
B :  Right .
B :  No . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uh okay . I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , User Interface Designer the user interface concept , and the trend-watching .
A :  So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on . And uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach .
D :  'Kay .
A :  So um I thank you for this meeting . And I think we have a lunch-break now .
D :  That's good .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So that's a good thing .
A :  Okay . Uh good afternoon . This is our third meeting already . I hope you enjoyed your lunch . I did anyway . Um let's see .
D :  Good afternoon .
A :  Presentation three . Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . It's the conceptual design meeting . And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components .
A :  Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes .
A :  Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . And then we're closing . We have about forty minutes .
A :  Uh so I suggest let's get started . Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?
B :  No .
A :  No ? Everything fine ? That's nice .
A :  Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . And we are going to use default materials .
A :  Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? No ? These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . And maybe we can uh work it out .
A :  And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers .
A :  So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , um I suggest let's get started with the presentations .
A :  So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ?
D :  Sure . I'll start off then .
A :  Okay .
A :  Good luck .
D :  Doh .
D :  'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . Um we've done some market research . We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires .
D :  And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the
D :  the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor .
D :  Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls .
D :  Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal .
D :  'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much
D :  the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have .
D :  Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the
D :  in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control .
D :  So this would be very important that we at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station .
D :  This is not really This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped .
D :  Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well
D :  people with less means .
D :  That would be all .
A :  Okay . Thank you . Any questions about the the trends ? Mayb
D :  Any questions ?
B :  Mm no .
A :  No ? Okay , we go on to the next one .
B :  Um 'kay um yeah . uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh
B :  uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um
B :  Uh and uh using a little uh display . So um findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions .
B :  So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and
B :  Uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting .
B :  Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . So uh using uh large large buttons . Um
B :  It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah .
B :  And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or
B :  A and uh yeah . Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um
B :  Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles .
B :  Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh
B :  um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . So uh Um
B :  Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine .
B :  Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons .
B :  And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . So um made a little uh picture of uh it . Um
B :  See .
B :  Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . So um
B :  D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh
B :  uh place where people uh , most of looks at . So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the
B :  So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh
B :  handy place . So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh
B :  Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so
A :  Okay .
B :  And that's it .
A :  Uh thank you .
C :  Okay .
C :  About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option .
C :  Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions .
C :  Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip .
C :  Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen .
C :  And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall .
C :  Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that . Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . And that's it .
A :  Okay . Thank you .
A :  So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts .
A :  Mm .
A :  'Kay .
A :  So these are the points we have to discuss .
A :  Um first
A :  I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um
A :  has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . Uh so
A :  uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think .
C :  Yes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery . Uh a hand dynamo . But I don't think that's really an option . You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . Uh solar cells . But not every room is very light so it's not a very good option . Or the kinetic energy .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  No .
A :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? You just
C :  Well y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . Yeah .
D :  You use it and it works .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .
B :  Nah .
C :  Yeah . That's true .
D :  And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um
C :  Oh .
D :  get great popularity for our product .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Um wel
B :  what's the function ? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries .
D :  Yeah you could load up the batteries , you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there .
B :  B b
B :  Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . So I believe one battery uh is just enough . Uh so
A :  Uh
A :  Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .
D :  That's true .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . That's true . Yeah .
A :  And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh .
A :  That's safe .
D :  I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?
A :  Yeah . That's a good point .
C :  Mm I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department .
B :  Mm .
D :  'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard .
A :  Yeah , sure . Go ahead .
D :  Um so it was open here .
D :  Um we also um
D :  asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that . So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control
A :  No .
B :  Mm .
D :  I would greatly advise not to do it . I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  younger people .
C :  But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess .
B :  'Kay .
C :  It's a bit higher percentage , but
D :  Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .
C :  Okay .
A :  Easier to use ? No , I think that's a good point .
B :  But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ?
D :  Um well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones .
B :  Okay .
D :  So pretty large .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information , and it's easy to ignore as well . So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it .
B :  No .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And um yeah I think the um Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So that brings us back to the energy . If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And that's the best choice .
A :  So
A :  Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip .
C :  Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . So it's gotta be advanced .
A :  Just the advanced .
A :  Okay , advanced chip .
D :  'Kay .
A :  And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ?
A :  Um as we saw there is not Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce . Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . Look I've got a new remote control , and uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , if it's just
B :  Uh I dunno .
A :  Yeah .
A :  That's right .
D :  wood-coloured .
B :  Mm .
A :  But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ?
C :  Mm I dunno . I'll have to uh research .
A :  You don't know ?
A :  I think so because Yeah . It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape .
D :  Probably .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . So
A :  Yeah .
A :  Change the cases . Yeah .
B :  maybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh Yeah .
A :  You can sell the cases . Yeah . I think that's a very good option . Because um then you can advertise as well with the Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Because that's a it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , which we can get a great advantage point . So and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah that is true .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though .
A :  Costs .
D :  'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a
D :  plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So that would
A :  Yeah . So you suggest we should design two different telephones
A :  on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example .
D :  Well I wouldn't design a telephone but
D :  Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um
A :  Remote .
D :  one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  So , but that shouldn't be too much of a problem .
A :  So everybody's okay with the changing covers ?
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I think that's a good uh good option .
A :  Changing case covers .
D :  Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . Could you explain that a little more ?
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And what would single curved and double curved mean ?
C :  Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality .
D :  Okay .
D :  So we can pretty much just do whatever we want .
C :  Pick one you like , yes .
A :  Mm . Okay .
D :  'Kay .
D :  That's good .
A :  Uh but the form has to be um It has to
A :  It's has to be possible to stand up ? Or just only to lie down ?
D :  No just to lie down .
B :  okay .
A :  And the the cover of the the docking station is also
D :  We'll go for that .
A :  on top of the television then ? Or not ?
D :  Well or besides it .
A :  And you can just yeah then click it in . That's okay . Um so the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ?
A :  Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  on the the board . Does somebody have ideas for a form or
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . So um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily Well uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . So that would be great for that . Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  For uh Uh for Yeah yeah .
D :  For left-handed users also .
A :  Yep .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah we um
B :  Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? Or Or isn't it ?
D :  For the volume . Um well that could
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .
A :  Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , and then it's
B :  Yeah okay .
B :  Uh .
D :  But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote .
B :  Mm .
D :  'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff .
B :  Yeah but
A :  But you have extra buttons . So people can get confused .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  That is true .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Especially if they have the same writings on it .
B :  See um yeah . Or we have to make a left uh For lefties and
A :  Can't we make uh Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use
A :  on the same
B :  Um
A :  functions as the normal one ?
B :  You mean um
A :  Then you have to
B :  Yeah if
A :  Let's see if I ca
A :  A blank one .
A :  And then you get
A :  Here's a little L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Uh now I have to think .
A :  It's a plus and a min .
A :  No it's not very handy I think . Because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of
B :  Mm no .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  No that's not gonna work .
A :  I guess . Maybe we should Yeah . But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? I think the functions are
B :  Um
A :  that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel or
D :  Yeah . That is true .
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's just uh u using uh your thumb . So um it's
A :  Y yeah . Yeah . I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uh but maybe we have to
A :  make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way .
B :  Yeah . Um
C :  I think we should start by by choosing a case . Because that's the basis you're building on .
B :  Yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um yeah just
C :  So I could draw them out .
C :  Let's look at the flat case .
C :  Oh .
C :  It's from the side so it's rather normal . The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So this type should be better for you or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit .
A :  Easier ?
C :  And the double curved s looks something like this I guess .
C :  So th those are the three options we have .
B :  Mm .
A :  'Kay . I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle .
D :  Mm .
B :  So um
B :  Do you say this um
B :  S uh
B :  Uh you got like uh sort of a I believe There ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So um you want to put a display over here ? Or not ? Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think so . Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  Yeah . Uh we can make it um Mm ? That's the top . So uh this top . This down . Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um Let's see . Um
A :  But now it's
A :  Do you have it upside down or Do you have it this that's top ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Colour uh okay .
B :  Uh to make this side um like mm
B :  the right colour . Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . So um
B :  Uh it's an
A :  Yeah .
B :  So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . So uh it's possib um yeah for s so and
A :  So get your mouse . Yeah .
B :  And to put uh the the buttons for um
B :  changing uh the channel uh over here uh
A :  Yeah . That's a good one . But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Uh rem
A :  So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here . If you can have this one , you turn it like this . And then flip it upside down .
B :  Yeah but this place um
B :  Uh it's Yeah I dunno um
A :  Because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  It's more logical to have it on top as well because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above .
A :  I think i
B :  Yeah so
D :  Yeah .
A :  On top .
B :  So
A :  Yeah .
C :  Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page .
A :  . So then we get
D :  Yeah .
A :  Here's That's the curve .
B :  Five minutes .
A :  Here the display , and then buttons . Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . Just that's for left hand and right hand users .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And then h the rest of the buttons over here .
B :  Yeah . But um the on-off button , um still on the top uh Yeah .
A :  Yeah still here jus
B :  Yeah .
A :  That's
D :  And I'd prefer the corners to be round .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . 'Kay .
D :  Think that would be better .
A :  Should be more bit more friendly , yeah .
D :  Friendly on the eye .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Supplements . That's okay .
A :  Where's my mouse ? Then
A :  We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . So check out the corporate website maybe .
A :  The user interface design , it's the same story . And product evaluation . So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach .
A :  So just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder .
C :  Okay .
A :  And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think . Which are Uh let's see . I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . And then you'll get a message .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So that's uh basically it . Maybe this one ? Then we can save this one in the
A :  folders group .
A :  Uh yes , it's here . SMARTboard , there it it . So if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again .
A :  Thank you .
D :  Very good .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  So
A :  Hello .
D :  Good afternoon . Sorry I'm a little late . Got stuck in the traffic .
A :  No problem .
A :  Okay . That's possible on uh this time of day . Starts at three o'clock . Uh Uh , let me see . Our fourth and last meeting .
D :  Yeah .
A :  There he is .
A :  Yes .
A :  Okay this our last meeting . In this meeting we will discuss our final design . And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . And then we're going to close the project today as well . So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money .
A :  And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . Um , in order to do that we have this agenda .
A :  We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . Then we will look at the finance . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote .
A :  But we will see that later . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that . We've got forty minutes . So we will be finished at half past three . But first um
A :  we will do the this is prototype presentation . So , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward .
C :  Okay .
C :  Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button . The mute button just below that . Then there's the volume and channel selectors .
C :  Simple plus-minus button . Uh we thought of a help button . If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo .
C :  So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it .
A :  Okay .
D :  Um , is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?
B :  So
C :  Sure uh just pop in at any time .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .
B :  Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh So um
B :  You put it uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons . And you But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay . Um
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons . But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons .
B :  Oh yeah ?
A :  So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons .
C :  I think if you look at
C :  most controls , they've got more buttons than this . And well the on-off button , it's it's a necessity . You can't drop that one . The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those .
A :  That's right .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does .
B :  Yeah yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh Yeah . But m Yeah . We disc discuss that already . But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option . So uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and uh
A :  Long time . Yeah . If you put
A :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  Well , you can't
C :  leave out the number buttons I guess .
B :  And uh
A :  Yeah . Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary . Okay .
C :  And
C :  Yeah . So it's rather basic already .
B :  Oh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Think so . That's what I pointed out earlier . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ?
C :  Yeah , they're It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . Just for recognition .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , it
A :  Just n normal plain buttons .
B :  Yeah yeah . Just to recognise it , so uh
A :  Yeah . 'Kay .
B :  Uh yeah and now we don't need uh LEDs or um
A :  No .
B :  Y uh s some uh remote controls uh do it also , but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it . Uh so
A :  No .
A :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case . So they jump out .
B :  Nay .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay . That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you
C :  And uh that's about it .
A :  that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros .
B :  Mm .
A :  If we see I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . I counted two batteries . But maybe we can also use one . I don't know if it's possible .
D :  Since it rechargeable .
A :  It's rechargeable . That's right .
B :  Yeah we can u just uh
A :  Okay . That's two Euros off . We need the advanced chip . So there's not much to uh
B :  'Kay .
C :  Yep .
A :  to save there . Here we have the single curves . Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um ,
B :  Mm .
A :  I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . I think we have to keep that .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Then we have the case material supplements . It's plastic . It's the cheapest one we need . So that's uh not much to save either . But then the biggest costs are the buttons .
A :  So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um ,
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  so if we Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . Because I Sixteen . Nah , that will be even more then . Eighteen Euros .
B :  Uh
B :  Sixteen , I believe so .
A :  So ,
B :  Uh seventeen .
A :  seventeen .
D :  Um
B :  Uh with the help button .
C :  Yep .
A :  Okay , including the help ? Yeah . Uh seventeen . I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button
D :  Damn .
B :  Yeah .
A :  uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number
B :  .
C :  Yep .
A :  long . That saves us uh one Euro already . 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Wouldn't Yeah . No . That wouldn't be an option .
A :  Fifteen buttons .
A :  And this is
D :  Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ?
A :  No those are one , I think .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well , think actually there're two buttons , aren't they ?
B :  Where did uh
B :  Uh , it's just one button . But , um
B :  Yeah . There were uh two uh for one big button . But they are uh more expensive than the small ones . Uh , yeah . So
A :  Yeah but th it's not stated in this files . So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing
B :  It's just a .
D :  Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .
A :  That's possibility as well .
D :  That would cut the cost .
A :  So And it's good for the design as well . So you can make
A :  Uh let's see . If you make this
A :  Looks a bit like uh
A :  a cross .
A :  Plus . Min .
B :  But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper . So uh , we've still got four buttons , but just um So
A :  Uh s yeah channel . Yeah w
A :  Yeah th I think they count uh the materials .
B :  You got uh not not a butt button itself , but uh on the um
A :  Yeah on the chip there . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons . So
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  That's right . That's right .
D :  Yeah .
A :  But I think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button . But No but I think
B :  Yeah , but
D :  But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow .
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . I think they uh try t
D :  Yes .
C :  Uh that's that's a big cost .
C :  If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
A :  That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ?
D :  Only the docking station , I guess .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic .
A :  No . That's extra . That's extra . That's right .
C :  So it's not even taken into the price .
D :  Maybe we should to a different supplier .
A :  That's an option . Poland . Something . Polish supplier . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well .
D :  Yeah .
C :  We we could save money on it . But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?
B :  .
D :  Yeah , that's what I'm wondering .
C :  My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message .
C :  So
A :  Yeah . That's a point .
D :  Um
B :  Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ? So um
B :  Yeah .
B :  We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or Can't uh go um
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
A :  No .
D :  Well , since the market research
D :  indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . Especially since we have those nice features .
B :  Nay .
A :  Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . We don't have any more budget to develop it . Yeah . So
C :  The margin will get too small . Yeah .
B :  Is it impossible to
B :  But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty .
B :  I don't think so .
A :  It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons .
D :  It would be a be a pretty rigid one .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Say Or you can take the single chip .
C :  Ten .
B :  But , you can't use uh
A :  There it is .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But we want to make a
B :  uh so uh uh fancy and a good uh Yeah .
A :  But then w
A :  Good looking .
B :  Uh , wi with n Oh , with uh
A :  Yeah .
B :  attractive uh o options . So uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . So
A :  I think it's uh difficult as well , but
D :  Or b
D :  Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .
C :  No remote .
A :  Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers .
B :  Scroll-wheel's one .
A :  Then w
C :  That's
A :  Because then we save ten buttons . Then we have five and one . And and see . If we have this one and we've got the advanced
B :  No , it
B :  Yeah .
A :  W uh , we're getting close .
C :  We're getting closer .
B :  Yeah .
D :  But how does scroll-wheel work here ?
A :  Then you will
A :  Or maybe you can
A :  um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also .
A :  Alright . It's gotta scroll and push . Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well .
D :  Integrated scroll-wheel push-button . But Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  You could just not scroll for a half a second .
A :  Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel .
C :  So you won't need a button .
D :  I think that would be like the end of our usability .
A :  But it would definitely crop cost , a lot . And we need the battery .
B :  D yeah .
D :  Yeah , but
A :  And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ?
C :  If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes .
A :  It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay . And we can save a Euro by a flat design .
B :  Hmm .
A :  That's an option we can Then we're almost there .
C :  Yep .
B :  Ja ja .
C :  Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button .
A :  Yeah . So if we
B :  Yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah but I think that's That is a big advantage , if we're
B :  So Yeah
B :  Yeah it's a big advantage . But um , it's
A :  But
A :  Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
C :  I think so . Yeah .
B :  Uh , yeah .
A :  If you push it three times ?
D :  Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , and teletext disappears . But the subtitles stay there .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B : 
B :  But if you push the teletext button twice
D :  I think that's the case on most
C :  What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight .
B :  It's uh
B :  One m uh one b uh , a few buttons .
A :  Ah that's not really that
D :  Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .
C :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is .
C :  No .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Holding a
A :  No .
D :  remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero .
D :  With only five buttons on it .
D :  And a scroll-wheel .
A :  I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel .
A :  If you just make it real simple .
A :  Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .
D :  True . True .
B :  Hmm .
A :  And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these .
A :  Mm eraser ?
A :  And we put uh
A :  Looks a bit odd maybe .
D :  That's a pretty big scroll wheel .
A :  That is
A :  Something like that . Then , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one .
A :  And these are two buttons then .
C :  We could make two buttons out of that . And just um
C :  If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel .
A :  Yeah .
A :  That's really a good good idea , I think .
A :  And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed .
C :  More obvious .
A :  So we make one for the volume , one for the channel .
A :  Plus scroll . That's right . So we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want .
C :  So if we
C :  Yeah . So
B :  Yeah .
A :  That's m that's better .
D :  So this is five buttons .
C :  If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . And make it smaller overall .
C :  So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button
A :  Y yeah .
A :  Mm yeah .
A :  Uh yeah , and then you can
C :  you get a a much smaller remote .
B :  Uh yeah .
A :  That's right .
C :  And it
A :  So we can
A :  decrease this one to four buttons .
C :  Yeah ?
D :  Right now we have five .
B :  But uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . It uh it's a bit uh
A :  Yeah . That's no problem .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . Single curved is really easy to just fill in . And cases come right out of the machine . And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one .
D :  Mm .
B :  .
A :  I think this is a really easy one . Um ,
A :  what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ?
D :  Well , I still think we should go for the single curve design . But then again ,
C :  Yeah .
B :  .
C :  Richard's argument was very good . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  all these changes are not really okay with me . But since
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
A :  We have to cut costs . Yeah . Yeah I'm ag
D :  we just have to .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I'd rather just go to the board and
A :  Ask for more money .
D :  get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah .
D :  Or do some market research and see what the options are .
A :  Yeah . But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more . So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . It will be necessary to have good help function , as well .
C :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So this is scroll .
A :  I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . Before we went on to the to the whole design .
D :  Yes . Definitely .
B :  The th
A :  But
A :  I'm glad we could make a bit .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one .
D :  It's pretty different . But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . This will really require a lot of marketing
B :  No .
A :  Yeah . It will .
D :  to get this to sell .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But um
D :  'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . This is not familiar for them .
A :  No , but I think
D :  So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .
A :  I think the most
B :  But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels . So maybe it's uh
A :  That's right . We can let l We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons . Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . Yeah . That's a good one .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So , I'm afraid we have to move on . And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh But we will see .
B :  Yeah .
D :  That's true . Might uh might be confusing too .
A :  Yeah . That's definitely right .
D :  They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But very special , so uh
A :  I would buy it .
D :  Yeah . But you're not sixty .
A :  That's right . I would buy it if I was six . No I don't know . What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? No ?
A :  Uh , yes they are .
B :  No .
A :  No . But we can go on with the project evaluation .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Let's see . I can sit down I think . We still have fifteen minutes left , so we're nice on schedule .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um , the project process .
D :  So um , I like set up all these criteria .
A :  Evaluation criteria . That's right . That was the the point I forgot .
D :  And evaluation of the
D :  thingy .
A :  I should
A :  There we are . Evaluation criteria . Go ahead . We've got five minutes I think for those criteria . No we've got fifteen minutes but
D :  Thank you .
D :  Five more minutes ?
D :  Okay .
A :  Uh yes . What ?
D :  'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier .
A :  Uh yeah .
D :  Translated it into criteria , which would be these . Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel . Innovative ? What new functions are there ? Uh , easy to use ?
D :  Uh , learnability is a very important factor here . Uh , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost .
D :  The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? And recognability . If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ?
D :  And
D :  So we're supposed to evaluate it right now .
A :  Okay .
D :  Let's see .
D :  Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting
D :  were not here .
A :  Yeah , that's because my pen failed to upload his data . I tried to but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software .
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah ?
D :  Interesting .
D :  So
B :  Mm . 'Kay .
D :  Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?
A :  I think it's fancy .
C :  Six .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh six . Yeah .
D :  We all go for six ? Good .
A :  Six .
D :  Um , is the design innovative ?
B :  Mm . Sh
A :  Very . Subtitles , buttons . Yeah . Seven . Yeah . So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ?
D :  I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Seven ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Should be do-able . Is the design easy to use ?
A :  Yeah . That's right .
B :  Mm . Not really .
A :  That's a bit dodgy .
D :  Well
D :  Would be for us . But
B :  For old people I I
A :  I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five .
C :  Four or five . Yes .
B :  W Yeah . Four .
D :  I'd go for four , too .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Is it functional ?
D :  Is the design functional ? Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ?
A :  Yes .
B :  N Yeah .
D :  I think we do . Do we have too many functions ? I don't think so . It's pretty slim .
C :  No .
B :  No .
A :  No .
A :  Think it's uh seven .
D :  Seven .
D :  Oh , and do we um
D :  take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and
B :  Mm m
D :  R_S_I_ influences ? Think we do .
C :  Mm , we haven't thought of that one .
A :  It was . I had them worked out .
A :  Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Are the production costs within the preset limits ? Well they are now .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Does the design fit the group of focus ?
C :  I think that's a three .
B :  Mm , th yeah .
D :  Yeah . I think it doesn't .
A :  No I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh
A :  I think it's better .
B :  We have to test it s But
D :  I don't know .
C :  I still I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy .
D :  I think
A :  I think it
D :  I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .
B :  Uh , yeah , true .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I would give it a four .
D :  I'm not sure . I think I'd go for two .
B :  I go for three . So
A :  Then we have to do the three . It's the
D :  'Kay .
D :  Is the company company recognisable ? Well , we have the logo there .
A :  Yes it is . Yeah .
B :  Yeah yeah .
D :  So
A :  And they wanna put fashion in their products . Uh in the slogan of the company . And we have the removable front cases . So , I think it's very recognisable . Yep .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So that will be this .
D :  I was also supposed to calculate the score , but
D :  thought we would have another private thingy after this .
A :  We've got a calculate it .
A :  Mm ?
C :  Twendag sieven an twendag .
D :  Is this Like after this , are we done ? Or
A :  N We've gonna We're going to evaluate it .
D :  We're gonna go to our other room again .
D :  Well , anyhow . These are seven factors times seven is forty
D :  something . Two ?
D :  No . Nine ?
A :  Forty nine .
D :  Uh , minus one .
D :  Minus three , minus four .
D :  Minus four .
D :  So that would be minus eight .
D :  Forty one out of forty nine .
A :  Forty one .
A :  That's
A :  Around eighty percent . What is it ?
D :  Okay .
D :  Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here .
A :  That's eighty four percent .
B :  Hmm .
A :  I think that's a pretty nice score .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm . 'Kay . So that will be the evaluation .
A :  Okay . Thank you .
A :  So ,
A :  that brings us to the project evaluation .
A :  Yep .
A :  Thank you . Project process . Did we move through the right phases , you think ? Along the process ?
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah . But it
D :  Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier .
B :  Yeah .
A :  That's right .
D :  In the design phase .
A :  So lack of information about prices .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . That's true .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Definitely .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh
A :  Okay . Satisfaction . Was there room for creativity ?
D :  No .
A :  No ? It's because of the finance sheet . Yeah .
D :  Not too much . No .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh
D :  Yeah , true . But
A :  The room was Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  And I would've liked to go for the
D :  younger users also .
B :  .
D :  And just to be able to access internet and
D :  get something of your own .
B :  Mm .
A :  Restrictions .
A :  Internet access .
A :  'Kay . Leadership . Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ?
C :  Yes .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you two of you with the uh last phase ?
B :  So
C :  Yes , was okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Nice .
C :  The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  tasks .
A :  Okay .
A :  Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ? Or were they too much ?
C :  Well , the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but
B :  Mm .
C :  The digital the digital pen is very nice .
A :  Smart-board .
B :  Yeah .
A :  If it wants to download its uh data .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  But
C :  Yes . Yeah .
B :  Uh
A :  Failed download .
A :  Smart-board was irritating .
A :  So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ?
C :  A flip-over or a more precise uh
B :  Yeah . A flipper's uh easier , so
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Faster as well , I think . Yeah .
C :  digit Yes .
A :  Flip-over .
B :  But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation , it's easier to uh share it with uh other people . Uh so uh you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory . So
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I tried to open the file on my laptop , but
B :  So Yeah ? No ?
C :  No . Didn't work .
D :  not possible .
A :  Uh you need a smart board uh application I think .
D :  Yeah .
B :  T can uh can you export it uh like a Yeah .
A :  But I think you can Yeah . Should be possible . Yeah you can export it as image .
D :  no .
A :  Must Yeah must be
D :  Should've done that then .
A :  So the sharing of the information was uh was okay ?
B :  .
D :  Pen is here .
C :  Yes .
A :  Uh , network . Yeah , pen is here on the table .
B :  Uh .
B :  Uh , yeah .
B :  So you can Uh
A :  Yeah . It's possible .
D :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  It's possible .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  That's nice . Have we found new ideas for
A :  having this kind of meetings ? Or
B :  Um , yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh
B :  Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer . Uh , so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So
A :  Yeah . So everybody puts his own score . And then it mediates the score , and you can get one Yeah . That's better . So that's uh
B :  So
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  How do we call ?
A :  criteria .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm , any more ideas ? Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ?
B :  Mm .
A :  Because I think
A :  then that we get to our last sheet .
A :  Are the costs within the budget ?
B :  Mm yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  They are .
C :  Considering we are not going to make a docking station .
A :  Do we
A :  Docking station . That's a good point . But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ?
B :  .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Perhaps .
A :  Uh and I think you can compensate that as well .
B :  Mm .
A :  So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? Or what was it ? Fifteen fifteen million . I think we will . If we gonna export this product . It's innovative . Especially in America . People are pretty decadent .
D :  Fifty grand .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Mm .
A :  Sometimes .
D :  Yeah , still I think I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway
B :  Yeah .
A :  You can do more .
D :  it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . So maybe we should just re-focus .
B :  Ah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Just put it on the market for everybody . You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . That's one thing you can change it with . So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . That's I think a good advantage .
D :  Or specifically for younger people .
B :  Ah .
B :  Ah .
D :  That's true .
D :  Yeah , I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with
D :  older people .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Even if it were their covers .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Uh , uh then I think we can have our little celebration , right now .
D :  But
B : 
D :  Party party .
A :  That's it . Yeah . I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think . I don't know . I didn't get a message
B :  Where's the champagne ?
D :  'Kay .
A :  from the from ending of the Oh I think I have one now . Five more minutes ? Oh that's nice .
B :  Uh , I believe y uh
D :  Oh you did .
B :  Okay .
A :  Then we still have some questions . If somebody has some questions they can ask them now . Or we can put these in the project folder as well . Maybe that's
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Export as picture , I think .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm . This is another network , I guess .
A :  Does somebody see the project folder ? I don't .
A :  Hmm .
A :  My Documents .
B :  Uh maybe uh they will save it . So uh
A :  Yeah , I'll just put it in My Documents and uh That's okay .
D :  Yeah , it probably will .
A :  Okay .
A :  I think I'm going to make our final presentation now .
D :  Oh yeah , you're supposed to make a final
A :  And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  Summary of the project .
D :  Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ?
B :  Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire . So uh
A :  Yeah . Questionnaire . I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room . And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes , or something . Okay . Thank you .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Hopefully my pen will download its software .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Oh .
A :  Or data .
D :  That'd be nice .
