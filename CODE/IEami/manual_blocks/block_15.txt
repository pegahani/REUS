D :  .. .
C :  Okay .
C :  So , this is uh first meeting of
C :  this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .
D :  Mm , yeah . I didn't receive it yet .
C :  Maybe not . Anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more . Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .
C :  S so any any questions ? Is i
A :  so sh
A :  .
D :  Not at this point .
C :  not at this point .
C :  So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product .
C :  The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .
C :  Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together .
C :  Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .
A :  I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?
C :  I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your
C :  um area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .
A :  Right .
A :  How how it will be done .
A :  So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?
C :  Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard .
A :  Hmm .
C :  So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project .
B :  Why are you looking at me ?
C :  Would you like to go first ?
B :  Do I have a choice ? Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere . Right , okay .
C :  Oh , yeah , p put them in pockets .
B :  Cool .
C :  You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .
B :  Okay .
B :  So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey so um
B :  Okay .
C :  It's got no eyes .
B :  Oh , good point .
B :  Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do it's eyes like ?
B :  Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit .
C :  I thought it might be a cat .
D :  Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat .
B :  Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .
D :  Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah .
C :  Yeah I can see by the ears .
B :  Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue . Rabbits don't come in blue but you know . Um okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .
D :  Ah .
B :  Okay ?
C :  Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ?
A :  Mm .
B :  I am the um I need my notebook , mm ooh top banana . Thank you . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert um so like
B :  I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design um so yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  'Kay .
C :  And more about yourself , you're from ?
B :  Um I'm from Leicester , um second year . Um what else do you want to know ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I like sports um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning um and uh
C :  But not with rabbits .
B :  not with rabbits , no no . And vets , I like vets as well . And yeah um and I like cocktails , especially pink ones . Okay ? Cool .
A :  Mm .
A :  Cool .
C :  Excellent , to match the rabbit .
D :  Okay . Um so my name is Maarika . Where's the pen ? Okay .
C :  There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .
D :  Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but mm hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um .
D : 
A :  That's not bad at all . Yep .
C :  Ah it looks like a dog .
D :  Okay .
B :  Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit . I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though .
D :  Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah . Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal .
C :  the other legs are on the other side .
D :  Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent . Um
C :  .
D :  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say . Uh I hope to be loyal to the project and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . I'm from Estonia uh , yep . Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , um so um in the different um stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for yeah , designing the technical functions of the um
C :  And where where are you from ?
C :  Estonia .
A :  .
D :  um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design .
A :  .
D :  Okay , that's it .
A :  Thank you .
A :  Okay um I'll do some
A :  I'll rub the features and let the drawing stay .
A :  'Kay um my name is Gaurav .
A :  Um my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is a cow . I've got no idea how to draw a cow .
C :  Good luck .
A :  Uh this is going to be
B :  They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns .
A :  Yeah , that'll do . Okay , so let let me draw the body first .
C :  Mm .
A :  Big , round body , really skinny legs and they've got a long tail and a long face .
C :  It's eating .
A :  And there is some grass there . So this is what I like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , they do not disturb anybody um they're kind of Buddhist in a way . So yeah , I like cows . Um my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .
B :  It looks like Eeyore .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Horns , draw some horns .
A :  Um I'm from India . Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . Yeah .
A :  Thank you .
C :  Excellent .
D :  Thanks .
C :  Right , now now it's my turn obviously .
C :  Okay , here's a space .
A :  That doesn't look like a cow , does it ?
D :  It looks very very cute .
C :  Yeah , I like the cow . I'm Jen .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . I like
C :  Mm .
B :  Is that a lizard ?
A :  No way .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Wow .
C :  It's a gecko .
D :  Ah , a gecko , okay . Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they yeah , they are mm-hmm .
A :  Ah okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Is there a difference ?
C :  They're
C :  Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . And I I like geckos because they remind me of warm places and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening .
D :  Ah .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Mm-hmm . I hope you don't like snakes , do you ?
C :  I don't like snakes . I come from Australia and we have nasty snakes . That's where I'm from , Australia . I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product .
D :  Wonderful .
C :  Okay .
A :  Thank you .
C :  So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation .
C :  So , I've just thought yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go . Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our
B :  If you right click on it you can
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  project . We've got um we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each .
C :  Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros .
C :  And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ .
C :  Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that
C :  profit target .
C :  So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing .
C :  Okay .
C :  Hmm .
C :  This is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?
D :  Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .
C :  Something something new .
B :  Yeah , I was looking at the website , and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh-huh .
A :  Alright .
B :  You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or
B :  Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? But what do most people do ? They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . Sometimes they play a movie .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , so
B :  there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , maybe to do
C :  So , no . It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .
A :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And then use the
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . Hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Excellent .
B :  'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .
C :  Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we
A :  Mm .
C :  move along ?
A :  Uh we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with l learning , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  A big learning curve , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a yeah .
C :  It's like those fancy websites
D :  Hm-hmm .
C :  that you can't access because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great .
C :  Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so
C :  you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,
A :  Alright .
C :  you're looking at the technical functions design ,
C :  and for you it's the user requirements specification , like you said at the start .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay ?
D :  Okay . Thank you .
C :  Thanks for that .
C :  Uh I'll see you in half an hour .
A :  .
D :  See you .
C :  Carry the laptops back again . Do we need to unplug things ? Probably .
A :  Hmm .
C :  All hooked up .
C :  Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . Um hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not .
C :  Did anyone ? No . Oh well . Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there .
A :  Mm .
D :  No .
D :  Mm .
D :  Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay .
C :  Project documents , yeah . So I'll put it in there . Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ?
D :  Oh okay , yeah .
D :  Yes , I think so .
C :  Yep . I'll do that next time . Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting .
C :  The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we've got forty minutes to do that in .
D :  Yeah , the last minute , yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I would
A :  You said uh targ target groups , what does that mean ?
C :  say yeah ?
D :  Um
C :  As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , yeah .
A :  Uh okay , 'kay .
A :  So are
C :  So we need to yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself .
A :  Okay .
C :  So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ?
A :  Alright .
A :  I can go first , yeah .
C :  You wanna go first ? Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .
D :  Okay . Hmm .
C :  I assume we just pull it out ?
D :  Mm .
A :  Right . Um so f from the
C :  Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , just so that I don't have to scribble everything down .
D :  Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay .
A :  Right sure .
A :  Uh okay .
A :  So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .
A :  So
A :  this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role .
A :  Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay , so these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um so basically uh the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it
A :  uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex .
A :  And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple . Um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard .
A :  Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the
A :  Okay .
A :  So if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the
A :  into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here .
A :  So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code ,
A :  which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver .
A :  Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um so i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . That's about it . So anything that you would like to know or
C :  Okay .
D :  Thanks .
C :  Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? Br
A :  No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . Um yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Anything else ?
C :  'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might
A :  Yeah .
A :  Certainly , yeah . So so tha yeah , we definitely need to operate within our constraints , but um unfortunately I I do not have any data , so uh I just identified the functional components for that .
C :  increase the price .
C :  Yeah .
C :  That's fine .
C :  Are there any more
C :  questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ?
D :  I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably .
C :  Yeah , I think that will do . Okay , so do you want to
A :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue okay , yeah .
C :  Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? I think that has to come out of there .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Thanks . Oh i
C :  Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst .
D :  Okay , I hope wait . Should it just
A :  I it'll take some time .
C :  It ta takes a little
D :  There's just nothing .
C :  Oh , and have you you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight .
D :  Oh right , right , right , um
D :  Okay .
D :  Nothin okay , something is coming up .
A :  Oh , there it is , yeah . It'll come up , it um uh no signal .
C :  Now it's coming , computer no signal .
D :  No signal ? Why ?
C :  Maybe again ?
A :  Yeah yeah , it says something now , adjusting
D :  Oh . My my computer went blank now .
C :  Okay , adjusting .
D :  Adjusting .
D :  But I don't see anything I don't see anything on my computer now . This is the problem , but
C :  There we go , there we go .
A :  Okay .
A :  Oh , that's strange .
C :  Oh , if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both .
A :  Okay .
D :  Um .
A :  And one more time .
C :  Okay , so one more time .
D :  Uh now it's okay . No ? No .
C :  Should yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting .
A :  Mm .
D :  Oh okay .
D :  Okay , that's fine , that's good .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay , let's start from the beginning . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up . Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And yeah , and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words . Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um um I als okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , okay , that's great .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um then yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . So at the for the time being that's uh that's all . If you have questions
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see .
C :  It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about .
D :  Yeah , and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different
D :  And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay . Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ?
A :  So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . Um but um so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ?
D :  Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use , I mean um what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno . I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um .
A :  Right .
A :  Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . So yeah ? Cool .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yep .
C :  Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one . Do you want to yeah .
B :  Cool . Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ?
D :  Uh am I going in the right direction ? No . Wait .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , here it comes .
C :  Oh , I'm getting hungry .
D :  Okay , here you are .
B :  Cool .
B :  Ah , that's why it won't meet . Okay , cool .
C :  You set ?
B :  Yep , cool . Okay , functional requirements .
C :  Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here .
B :  Alright , yeah .
C :  Hello .
A :  try to press oh , okay , yep .
C :  Is it plugged in prop it's working ? Okay .
B :  It's working .
B :  Cool , okay . So
C :  Excellent .
B :  what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway .
B :  Um okay , so . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control . Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide . Um I dunno what zapping is , but
C :  It's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .
B :  Oh , right . But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly . Okay ? Cool . Um so this is my little graph thing .
A :  Mm .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm .
C :  Ooh , that's a bit difficult to see .
B :  Mm k
C :  If you explain it to us it'll be fine .
B :  Okay , well , I can send it to all of you . What it is is um it's cones , 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting . Um but ooh where's it go ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  I liked the , I liked the litt ooh come back .
B :  Back .
B :  Oh .
C :  No .
B :  Oh yes , cool . Okay , I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing . Um okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm , that's the next one along , yeah ?
B :  Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know , so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay . This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . Okay , cool . So um okay , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . Uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , but you know , it's up there . Um that yeah . Okay , so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  The remote control .
A :  Mm .
A :  Right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes . Okay , cool . Right , um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . Um okay , but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it . Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . Um okay ?
A :  Hmm .
C :  That's alright .
C :  Mm .
A :  Right .
B :  Cool . Um okay , so these are my personal preferences . So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool . Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . Um there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . Um and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone
A :  Mm . Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Some kind of a ring , some
C :  Keys and things like that , yeah . Whistle and it screams at you , yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's it , you know .
B :  I know , it's weird . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . So okay ? Cool . That's me .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right .
A :  Hmm .
C :  That's you , excellent .
A :  Okay , that's great , thanks .
D :  Um that's very good , very interesting .
C :  Um .
C :  I'm just gonna tick yes .
C :  So , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss
A :  Mm .
A :  I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . Um .
B :  Cat's . Ca .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , but I'm assuming , you know , yes .
A :  Right .
A :  Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions .
A :  Right , and
A :  Right .
B :  Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? So , you know
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally . I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and
D :  Yeah . Yeah , you share a television or something that yeah .
A :  Right . But uh still , if if you can go back to that slide and uh , how popular was it ? Oh , oh , okay . That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  O oh it's on sorry , we unplugged it .
B :  Oh , I've unplugged it . Do you want me to
C :  Here , let me
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Seventy six point three percent .
D :  It was seventy something , yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like I mean , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , you don't
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , they've got no commitments and
A :  Alright .
C :  usually not a car and all of those things .
B :  normally have a car , yeah , so . You're still learning to drive actually , so that just costs more than a car , but yeah . Um so I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think .
C :  Kids . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So you're more likely to b
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people .
B :  No , I mean that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah this this is not unaffordable , but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I d I don't know many people without a T_V_ . We didn't have a T_V_ last year , and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But do they
C :  But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote .
D :  Common , the students yeah , yeah . The s the stu yeah , and the remote control might not yeah , it might not even function with the old T_V_ .
A :  Mm .
A :  Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? So mm uh are are are
B :  Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , we're still yeah . Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . You know , so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , because actually I mean they're all still re young people . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Is not a massive difference , you know . No , do totally .
C :  Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ?
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? Uh and uh
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? Because you have like I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . But how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it , you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I don't know .
C :  Yeah . With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five ,
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
C :  louder , tha that should be relatively simple .
B :  S so
A :  Right .
A :  Okay . O
B :  y you'd maybe need a code word . Do you know what I mean ? So like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ , so maybe like , you know , remote . I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ? Although I only watch Charmed , so really I wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check . Um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group
C :  and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising .
D :  Yeah but uh um
D :  Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls .
D :  Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and um , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote .
C :  Yeah , I think we need both .
A :  Mm . W
A :  What uh
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
A :  What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , some kind of
C :  Uh-huh . Uh-huh .
B :  Yeah , that would be another way to do it .
C :  So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great .
B :  Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because I mean Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Watch Sky and yeah .
A :  Alright .
B :  Yeah , yeah , and that would be really annoying .
A :  Yeah , that's
A :  Right .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But that's definitely a possibility .
D :  Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ?
C :  So that you can yell at it , yeah .
B :  Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
D :  Yeah , but then the remote control I think I mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself .
B :  Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then
A :  Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean it'll it'll mm .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  No , but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That's but then if you're buying the remote separately , but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah , yeah .
A :  Right , yeah , yeah , yeah .
D :  Okay , yeah , mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control .
C :  The l
A :  Alright , yeah .
C :  Well that's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises .
B :  Yeah , definitely , yeah .
C :  Yeah . Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um .
C :  But if we go away with that that kind of general
C :  um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um .
D :  The major ones , yeah .
A :  Right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . It should be on your desktop , so on the yeah . So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So where exactly is this i
A :  Ah , okay . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Did you find it ? It's just yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah , yeah in that one , right yeah .
C :  Yeah , and email them round .
B :  Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ?
C :  Yeah , that would be great .
B :  Okay .
D :  Oh so so we'll just put them i there , we we yeah , w we won't even okay .
C :  Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah , then you don't have to email them .
B :  There you go .
B :  But is everyone's called functional requirements ?
C :  No , they're all called something slightly different . Technical requirements and something something , yeah . So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to .
A :  No .
B :  Okay , so that's good . That's me done .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , cool .
C :  Um as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . Yeah ? Whatever that means .
A :  Right .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I guess I'll find out .
C :  You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ?
D :  Uh something conceptual , yeah .
A :  Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh .
C :  Components , yeah .
D :  Hmm . Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our
C :  No , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary .
D :  To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good .
D :  Okay .
C :  Okay ? Right on time . Okay , so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ?
D :  Cool .
D :  Okay , see you .
C :  Excellent . So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .
A :  Right .
C :  Okay . Um , do you wanna start again ? Let me we've got forty minutes .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right s so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation , yeah , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead . Um mm , okay , so basically I'll start off by uh I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that .
C :  You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Let's hope the pen holds out .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote , right ? If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , uh everything else is kind of
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh on pressing this button I a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . Right ? So that's the important point here , so these are the different options that we have .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells , yeah ? Uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And dynamos .
A :  Um yeah , yeah . So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this , but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options . So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones .
B :  Does that mean like a wind-up one ?
B :  A wind-up remote .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ .
A :  Yeah .
C :  And charging their remote , yeah .
B :  Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just
A :  Yeah , it's a good option . The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something . And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company . Environment friendly . Okay um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective . There are different cases that can be provided . They can be basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided
D :  So what was what was this k ka
D :  Okay .
C :  Uh yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  For a remote , 'cause you
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with on both the sides .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  These are the three options , right ? Um
D :  Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah , mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever uh there were different kind of supplements available , um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ? Wo wo wood .
D :  Yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  Did you say wool ?
C :  Wood , wood . A fluffy remote .
B :  Wood . Oh right .
A :  Yeah . Not wool .
B :  .
B :  Yeah , you'll understand why when we get to my presenta .
A :  Oh really ? Okay . Um the so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment , so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface . If we choose this , we cannot use titanium . For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic . Yeah ? Uh okay , the interface options now . So
C :  Huh .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons .
A :  Ooh . Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh
B :  Sony .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it .
A :  Yeah , yeah , something like that . So , and they have they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing . The scroll plus push . So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , um in the last decade , so not too recent . And L_C_D_s , we can have L_C_D_s . So these two are recent and and this is q quite old . The various electronic options are um
B :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh so there's there's a chip behind this one , right ? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  or a regular
A :  or advanced .
A :  And uh the price goes up
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  as we go down , obviously . Um okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip . Um the we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right ? Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , which is did not explained what i what it was , but I'm guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker .
A :  So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . Yeah , on . Um and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . So , these are the different options that we have .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so th that's that's basically now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Excellent . Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to you can sit down , but just we might need you to leap up .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , yeah , sure . Sure . Yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  What are you , PowerPoint , or
D :  Um I have some PowerPoint , yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Right .
D :  Oh .
C :  Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ? Some sort of radiation ?
D :  'Kay .
B :  No it's got its little camera in there , plug it in .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  'S a
A :  Yeah , it should should do it . Yeah .
C :  Right , interface concept .
D :  Okay . Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk . So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again . Okay .
C :  That's fine .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant . Um and then um this uh this um
D :  this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . So some findings um um .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . Um okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found .
D :  Okay , some of them are here . Um well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh oh oh , sorry for that .
D :  'S go back .
A :  That's nice one .
D :  Ah , no , please .
D :  Okay , so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . Um okay .
B :  Ugly .
C :  Mm .
D :  So let's carry on with this . Um
D :  So uh um o other findings um some new things um used , uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . Our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait , no this is not the one .
D :  Okay , there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  It's yeah .
D :  Um s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um
D :  uh programmable speech uh
D :  mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's it should be . Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever . So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh-huh , hi yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? Um uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? Uh oh yeah are th
C :  It's like the like you said , no ? The scroll scroll wheel .
D :  No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you just a moment , I'll I'll show you . I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons . Look , this one here . But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round , it's like you press this or this or
B :  Yeah , you can't
A :  Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah .
B :  Oh , it's like the iPod .
B :  G yeah , no , you can . It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round and it yeah . It is
A :  Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh
C :  Uh-huh .
A :  Alright , right . Okay , okay .
A :  So instead of going down you just spin yeah , yeah .
B :  You just go round and it is a bit weird at first , but it's actually very like fast .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh-huh .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , but you've got a lot less control over it .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right . So maybe I should include that here as well , L_C_D_s um plus spinning .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Uh
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time . It it has to be small , simple . Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . There is uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So yeah , that's uh that's it .
C :  Excellent . Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once .
A :  Right .
B :  Okay , I've put the copy of the presentation in um the yeah .
C :  The project documents . Excellent . If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Cool .
C :  Here it comes .
C :  Okay .
B :  Fabulous . Okay , cool . Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future . Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right . Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really .
C :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for . And um , yeah it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel . So
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ? Right . So mm uh so it yeah , so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ? Um and an yeah . Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ , I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons , and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ?
C :  Yeah , yeah , sure . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  That's over on the interface , if if you could put
C :  Yeah .
C :  And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Depends how fast your television runs , really , don't don't you think ? I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . And if you get the number in wrong , then it's a bit of a pain , so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
A :  Right .
A :  Right .
C :  It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , so if you're watching something
B :  You know ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  That's true , yeah , that's also
B :  And i it would be like I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than
C :  Yeah . Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched . So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control . So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , yeah .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm right .
C :  And then you can flip it open .
A :  Okay .
A :  So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and
C :  Yeah , I think so .
B :  Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing .
A :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
A :  You you agree ? Maarika , yeah ? Yeah .
D :  Yep , yeah .
C :  Right .
A :  So L_C_D_s , yeah , definitely . Go on .
B :  Okay ?
B :  Cool . Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration . Sorry , I discovered clip art . Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture . So I mean , I'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness .
B :  Do you know ? 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables . You know ?
C :  Yeah , and possibly even uneven , like not not symmet yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , bit of asymmetry and stuff . But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there , because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand . Um yeah , I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Something a bit squishy and
B :  Yeah , but I mean y you have to
A :  Yeah , we we have we have rubber , but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using
D :  So it could be like a rubbery yeah , uh-huh .
B :  Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber .
C :  Yeah , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  To some degree .
A :  So if if we use uh latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , so um we could use titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh
C :  Uh-huh .
C :  Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things .
B :  If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , you could just bounce it up and down .
A :  Yeah , w energy source .
C :  From from bouncing it . You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open .
A :  Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah .
B :  Yeah . Um so yeah , um okay .
A :  Mm .
A :  So probably double curved surface is the way to go , yeah , .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Mm yeah .
A :  Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . Um
B :  You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think . It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ? It uh
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  No , I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference . I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight , but it's curvy , so . Besides , you have four sides to a thing , so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ?
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Uh I think uh
C :  Yeah , 'cause the
C :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
A :  Right . Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three . Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case . It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all .
C :  Dunno .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Nothing to open them .
B :  Yeah . Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from . But no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time . Okay , cool .
A :  Right , yeah , yeah .
A :  Right .
A :  Okay .
C :  Anything else ? What've we got ?
B :  Uh combine style with a level of functionality , um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function .
A :  Cool , thanks .
C :  Okay , so .
B :  Okay ?
D :  Thanks
C :  Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel .
A :  Yeah . Let's let's try to r rub off things and yeah , so um hand dynamos are definitely out , right ?
C :  Yeah , rub off some of those .
C :  Yeah , it's not that's not streamlined and sexy , having a having a wind up .
A :  You you got a wind dynamo , yeah .
D :  Yeah uh-hum yeah .
A :  Okay . Um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , but uh
C :  I think tha
B :  It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? You know ? I mean if
A :  it's
A :  Yeah . As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user .
C :  Depends how much how much movement it really needs . Pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it . I'd I'd keep it on .
A :  Kinetic energy it needs I don't have too much technical information on that , yeah , right . Okay , let's keep it option uh keep an option , yeah . Um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah .
C :  We don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable .
D :  Yeah it's yeah .
A :  Um okay , we still have all all the options . Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ?
D :  N wood is I can't n how do you uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh you can't make it like thin and
A :  Mm .
A :  Right .
D :  The wood thing . Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky wi mm-mm yeah .
B :  I can't imagine a m wooden remote control .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break , it's it's much more uh
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more
D :  U yeah wood is not really yeah .
B :  Well it's not very cleanable either , do you know . It's it's not a practical I mean it's it's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know .
A :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That's true .
A :  Yeah .
B :  And splinters and stuff and
A :  Yeah , okay wood is out .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It just m doesn't make any sense , I think is the thing with wood .
A :  Right .
D :  Yeah , yeah , in the case of remote control not really .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface . Right , so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry , but uh it seems to be out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be
C :  Yeah .
B :  You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ?
D :  Yeah , but you um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  G yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm right .
D :  Yeah , so for channel numbers but
A :  Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display .
D :  But I th yeah but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah , it's faster with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open , but it's it it's more time-consuming .
C :  Just for fast
A :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm right .
D :  Yeah .
C :  And it yeah L_ L_C_D_ .
A :  So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? Or do we have just uh channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ?
D :  No , no , I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers , because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels . Um
A :  The numbers .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ?
A :  Right .
A :  Or on the L_C_D_ we can , you know
B :  G yeah , I would think buttons , yeah .
D :  Yeah , I would say buttons , because it's yeah .
C :  Buttons .
A :  Okay . So mm
B :  It's it's the I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , but , you know , I mean most of the time I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the the the issue there .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Alright .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um
C :  I think that's what you guys are gonna do next , so if we put down the key um things that we want .
A :  Uh okay .
A :  Okay , okay , so the components . Right , so uh what about the the scrolling uh ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I yeah , about the spinning wheel . So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , it's uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you yeah , yeah , in that case .
B :  E either or
C :  Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say .
B :  G yeah .
B :  I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , so you have to decide whether you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Mm um
C :  But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . Th that would be on one side , uh-huh .
D :  Ah , but I mean you can
B :  Yeah , but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side .
A :  I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . Uh i it
C :  No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside .
D :  Yeah , I um I think so too , I mean the case would be yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons ,
B :  You want an outside of rubber and then open it up and
A :  Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that . Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  rubber buttons , but then
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Or maybe like interchangeable cases .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit .
C :  Mm .
A :  Right , right .
A :  Right , okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . Um
B :  Yeah , I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now .
A :  Right . Yeah , and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ? So
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That's right , that's what they're after .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I'll rub that out .
A :  And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than
A :  Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah I think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or
C :  I guess .
B :  That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though .
D :  Yeah , does
C :  Bananas .
D :  Yeah . Banana's yellow , yeah , definitely .
B :  Yeah , but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? So you could have like I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Green .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay . Um okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes , so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend .
C :  We need the advanced yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So I'll rub off the other two .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or
C :  That was the
A :  Oh is oh the constraint was uh yeah .
B :  If solar panels with the rubber .
C :  We can't have solar panels with rubber , so .
A :  Yeah . So
B :  Yeah , okay , so we lose that I think .
C :  Shall we go for if we're going for rubber , we think uh on as our case , and then
D :  Mm-hmm . And the buttons as well , I think . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I think uh we'll have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem uh interesting . But it does not hold any advantages as such for a yeah .
C :  We've got five more minutes .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , mm-hmm .
B :  It's just a gimmick .
A :  Okay . Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in , but if it's
A :  Ye yeah , we we don't have too much information about it , um
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but it it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah .
C :  It's from the company , so
A :  Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other .
A :  Right .
A :  Flat on the top .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer ?
B :  Yeah , sure j
C :  Just so we can
B :  Sorry , do you want me to
C :  Nothing , it's right , I'm just
C :  There we go .
B :  What does um I_C_S_ mean ?
A :  I_C_s ? Uh integrated circuits .
B :  Okay , cool . So it's advanced integrated circuits ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Uh oh now I've gone too far .
A :  Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  We're on our way .
C :  Okay . So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber and
A :  Right .
A :  Yep .
C :  the buttons are also rubber . We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . That's our overall concept , and it's gonna look sort of vegetable , and be in bright vegetable colours .
D :  Um
D :  Uh-huh . So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer
B :  Imagine it would be inside . So um actually that could like really cut down your thing , so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into . Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the
C :  I think it's on the
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-mm . Yeah .
C :  On the
B :  You've maybe got , you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel , and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  In the centre , yeah , sure . Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . Is that all okay ? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it .
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Cool .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Cool , I'm gonna go and sit on my own .
C :  Y ah nobody wants to talk to you . Unplug yourself .
B :  I know , I'm hated .
D :  Hmm .
B :  I've got a bit tangled up in all this .
D :  So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with we need to
C :  I dunno , maybe I would car
A :  I'm proud of it .
C :  Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting .
C :  And again I'll take minutes . The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Um then
B :  It does look very cool .
C :  then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S
B :  And then do we get to make a remote control ?
C :  'Cause we missed out .
B :  Yeah .
C :  it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four
C :  fifteen .
A :  Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ? Yeah .
C :  Is that right ?
D :  Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .
C :  Yeah , until about four fifteen . So yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so .
C :  Go for it . Do you want
D :  So , you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and
C :  Yes .
A :  Presentation .
A :  Okay . Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . Um
B :  You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? It's a bit um phallic .
A :  Yeah . Um
D :  Well , but it's it's just an a approximation .
C :  Dual use , perfect . Dual use , perfect . Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? Sorry , sorry .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh , your remote control ? Oh that's just bad .
A :  Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . So now we we have the okay , so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Wow .
A :  well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .
C :  And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that
D :  Uh yeah .
A :  Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .
D :  Rubber .
B :  Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?
D :  Yeah , .
D :  Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be and yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , so we said the back side round , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . And it's spongy as well . So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .
A :  Mm . Hmm .
B :  I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah .
C :  Huh .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Six seven eight nine . I like that .
D :  Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  So where's the volume ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  The volume is is scrolling . On the side , this one . Yeah you just do it like this . And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .
A :  It's on the side .
B :  Ah , you did get that in then , mm-hmm .
B :  Oh okay , .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  See ? So the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose . You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .
A :  Uh no , we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials .
D :  A mute button .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display .
C :  Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you
B :  On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .
C :  .
A :  Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .
D :  Well , but the but the mute yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?
C :  But if you hold it in , if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?
B :  Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ?
A :  Mm .
D :  Okay , yeah , okay .
B :  Okay , cool . So that that solves the whole mute issue .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . You can't really see it in the interface .
C :  no .
A :  Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere .
D :  Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well .
C :  Mm-hmm , very good .
D :  So I think it
C :  And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .
D :  Yeah .
B :  .
D :  Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .
A :  Cool .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  We ran out of resources here , so .
D :  In the actual one .
D :  Yeah . So if you have questions .
A :  You can have a look .
C :  Very good , let's have a look . Test it out .
B :  .
C :  Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess .
B :  Yeah , oh , we hold the remote . Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . But yeah , uh that's cool , cool .
C :  Very good . Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , see the budget .
B : 
C :  We'll just send all of our manufacturing to
C :  some nice poor country and
C :  cut some of the prices that way .
B :  Wales .
C :  Wales , for example .
B :  Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay .
B :  Fabulous , yeah . Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design . Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know .
C :  Marketing Expert .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . Okay ? Cool , so these are what they are . Oh
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ?
B :  Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .
C :  Mm dots , never mind .
A :  I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything .
D :  Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive .
C :  Yeah , I agree .
D :  Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot .
B :  Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ?
D :  Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ?
C :  Yeah , just prepare one now .
B :  Yeah .
D :  It will be red , too .
B :  Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at .
B :  That's this one . What do you all say ?
D :  S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? I I go for seven .
A :  So ?
C :  I reckon it
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . Yeah .
B :  Oh we're all so proud of the . Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ . Could oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .
A :  Yes .
C :  Ah , okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  Excellent . Except we can't uh we can if we then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine .
B :  Yeah . But that's alright . If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?
A :  But we can we can I can I can take note uh uh
C :  Yeah .
D :  I would think yes , yeah .
C :  I think it does .
A :  Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger .
B :  Yeah . I mean
D :  Yeah , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .
C :  Alright .
C :  But that's gonna be a problem , 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family .
B :  Yeah .
A :  But then yeah .
A :  Yeah . So bu it's it's not a huge problem , because i i it is operatable .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen .
D :  But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , so they just
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , but they can normally do most things right-handed , so I would say it's not such a big issue .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
D :  Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? What do you what do you all think ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Um
C :  Six .
A :  Mm .
D :  Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues , I mean . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I think I think for um I mean most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to um
D :  Yeah .
A :  One more thing is that i
B :  Okay .
C :  They
A :  It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , so it opens on the side . So
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  No , yeah , but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah . So it won't be a problem , it will be and it will be it won't be heavy .
A :  Yeah yeah yeah , I mean yeah . So you guys can decide wh whether
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Oops .
B :  I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .
D :  Yeah well yeah , but it's it's a bit long . It's a little bit long . Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah .
A :  Yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah .
C :  The length is gonna be difficu
B :  Yeah um
B :  But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ?
A :  Uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel .
C :  Mm .
B :  Because
D :  S uh slightly smaller .
B :  So you have to keep that side flat .
D :  Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that .
A :  Okay .
B :  So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work .
A :  Right .
B :  Okay . Um okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? There's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , doesn't it ? To make it beep . Or a buzzer .
A :  Okay .
C :  No , we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot .
A :  No , we have a locator .
D :  Mm that you stick on T_V_ .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds , so yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ? Fabulous . D_ .
D :  Yep .
A :  Intuitive , completely intuitive .
D :  Yeah . If uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's I th I think it's
C :  Yeah .
C :  I'd say six , 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it , but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Intuitive .
B :  Yeah , and I mean d
C :  So
A :  And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .
C :  Might be
C :  But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So , should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ? Yep .
A :  So l
C :  Five ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay . I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so .
C :  I'm happy with five ? Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I'm glad you're accepting this . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? Um intuitive
B :  but
B :  Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? Um okay , cool , E_ , okay .
A :  Mm .
B :  Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed .
B :  Investigate .
C :  Yep . But otherwise it's superb .
B :  So , should we give it a six ? Six ?
C :  Six .
D :  Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , yeah ? See .
C :  Yeah .
A :  .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting .
D :  Yeah , so it's kinda
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well we've banned them from
A :  Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic .
B :  I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest .
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's varied .
C :  Yeah . Six ?
B :  Okay , so we give that a six , yeah . Okay , F_ .
D :  Yeah , it does have yeah .
A :  Absolutely .
C :  Voice control have seven .
B :  Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just
C :  Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide .
B :  Oh okay , cool . Um right , so .
A :  So it has voice control .
B :  Yes , so that's a seven then . Um , cool .
A :  Yep .
C :  G_ technologically innovative .
A :  Anyway it ha yeah , it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen .
D :  Technologi well
C :  But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but I mean you don't
C :  All of the components have been used in other things before . But do yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote .
B :  They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .
D :  But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new .
C :  Yeah . What do you reckon , five , six ?
B :  .
B :  Yeah , what do you all think ? Six ?
D :  Six .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? It still has to do what i what it has to do .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well , that's it , I mean
B :  Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? So , I don't think many peop
C :  Space remote .
B :  That's it , they can take it with them .
C :  Put fashion in electronics .
A :  Absolutely . The carrot banana remote .
D :  Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? Yeah , sure .
D :  It's the maximum fashion . Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .
B :  So , we give it seven , and we write
B :  There we go .
D :  So I think we've done very well , but
A :  I think that's a .
B :  Cool . So , we need the average here , so we got
C :  Very good .
D :  What's the assessment ?
A :  Yeah .
D :  The average is about six and something . A little bit over six .
C :  Yeah , one .
B :  Seven
C :  Or a seven .
A :  There are how many sixes ? One , two , three . Three .
D :  No , wait , a little bit under six . No , wait .
B :  So we've got four sevens , so that's twenty eight , three sixes , eighteen .
A :  And one five .
D :  Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah .
C :  Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .
A :  Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one . Fifty one divided by
D :  Four sevens .
C :  Six point point about six point five . Close enough .
D :  Six point something , yeah .
B :  Two three four
D :  Six point five , yeah .
B :  Seven eight .
B :  Okay , that's pretty good , I think .
C :  Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it .
C :  That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ?
B :  Um no , that's it , yeah .
C :  That's it ? Alright . So , finance .
C :  And we'll see if we can
C :  unscrew this first .
C :  Sorry , this is I'm just um
B :  Cool , there we go .
B :  .
B :  There we go and there are the marks .
C :  Beautiful . Not anymore .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Computer no signal ?
A :  Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit .
C :  Adjusting .
C :  There we go .
C :  Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria .
C :  And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that .
C :  Can you read that ? Almost .
C :  More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ? One simple battery . No kinetic energy , no solar .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .
A :  Advanced , yeah .
D :  Yep .
C :  Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .
D :  Yeah , yes .
C :  Case material we said rubber . I don't know what special colour means .
D :  Rubber .
A :  Yep .
A :  Mm anything uh I think which is not more .
D :  I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ?
C :  It could be
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know .
C :  Rub rubber comes coloured , it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , yeah yeah , okay .
C :  Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , you might end up having to take off the
C :  We we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton , and then we've
D :  We have pushbuttons ,
B :  sample sensor .
A :  Mm .
D :  scro we have scroll wheel as well .
C :  Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? S for the muting .
D :  S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah . And we have L_C_ display and yeah .
A :  No uh we we have uh yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And button supplements .
D :  Um
A :  Mm no .
B :  .
B :  No .
A :  We don't have we're not using any of that .
C :  No .
C :  No ?
D :  Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel
C :  But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , let's yeah .
B :  We've got more than one pushbutton though , haven't we ?
C :  I think the pushbutton oh .
B :  'Cause then you have
C :  I don't know if that's one
B :  That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget .
C :  Yeah .
C :  That seems unlikely .
C :  Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we I don't think that makes sense .
A :  Huh ? Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh .
B :  Twelve point five .
D :  We have to count all of them , or yeah .
A :  Mm I don't think so , no . No it says what what is the kind of interface , if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have .
B :  No . Well it doesn't , but it uh
C :  No .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And L_C_ display .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .
A :  Wh wh what's our criteria ?
B :  This sample sensor .
C :  Our budget's twelve point five .
A :  Uh okay .
B :  Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .
C :  Yeah , so that has implications though for the .
A :  Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello .
B :  Yeah .
C :  For the locator .
B :  But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? We can afford to get rid of it .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm and the locator also goes away .
D :  But it was very no innovative innovativeness . Well um yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So that means no locator , does it ?
B :  I mean does
C :  What else does it need ?
D :  Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .
C :  Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing .
D :  This would be
D :  Yeah , yeah yeah there you record your samples your speech samples and
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , okay , so we
A :  A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um yeah .
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Um
C :  Right , so we need one fifty off .
B :  See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause
C :  Take it down to just a scroll wheel .
C :  We could do
A :  So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .
D :  Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget .
D :  Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But that's well you would just have to to spin it down .
C :  You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So that's point three .
A :  No w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .
D :  But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well .
D :  If you
B :  Yeah , I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_
C :  That's with the L_C_
A :  That comes with the L_C_D_ ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  We decided , 'cause it's not on our list .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Oh so so the the this is
D :  Mm .
C :  The scroll wheel is on the side .
A :  . So we're adding costs for right , okay uh I mean I think this is good .
D :  So
B :  S so we're point three over .
C :  We're point three over at the moment .
C :  It's nothing n
B :  Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume .
B :  Could b still put them on the side .
B :  But yeah . I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but
C :  Yeah , I have
A :  Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . On the side . Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , yeah .
C :  Rather than having three different things that people have to do .
A :  .
D :  Okay .
C :  There we go . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses .
B :  Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ?
C :  Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .
B :  Yeah , but
C :  So that's alright . We we'll leave it at that and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , yeah . Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  We have , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  No . No , I don't think so .
A :  Not really , no . Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . Um yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Alright then .
A :  But we lose the locator .
D :  Well we're going to have a beeping thing . But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate .
B :  Really ?
C :  We're gonna have a beep .
A :  So instead of speaker , .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Cool .
B :  That's not a very exciting colour . I think you should make it more vegetable-like .
C :  Tha
D :  Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the
B :  Oh the the beeper thing .
C :  .
B :  It
D :  But it can be yellow as well . It can come in the same colour as the the case .
C :  'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh .
B :  Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate .
C :  Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates . But only for a very short time . Um
B :  You know , your pen vibrates ? Yeah .
C :  okay .
C :  looks like we've designed a
C :  banana . Well done , team . Um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .
A :  I think it mm
B :  Cool .
C :  Feedback ? Ideas ?
D :  Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . Um we kap kept a adding things randomly . So , had we known
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .
A :  Yeah , that or not , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah . So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .
A :  Yeah , mm .
B :  I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . It wasn't like we were alone for very long , so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . Um yeah , so yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm . Banana .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .
C :  Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens . We like the pens .
D :  And the pens .
B :  Uh I like the pens . I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s
C :  Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office . They great ?
A :  Yeah yeah yeah , that's it's it's I wonder what one of these costs .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Do you think they'd notice if one went ?
B :  I don't think you should say that was the recording . Okay , cover up the microphone . Alright , let's take it . Okay .
C :  Oh okay .
C :  Yep . Shh . Yep . But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , yep .
B :  It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  The thing flew in , you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah .
B :  Not that you can do that on the board , either . We could make some little
D :  But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .
B :  Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . back it , this is just had to be changed . And yeah , so cool .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ?
C :  And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well .
D :  Yeah . I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .
C :  I have no stake in it .
B :  Yeah , definitely . You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .
A :  Yeah .
C :  You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes . I'll leave the room and you can have another go .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it .
C :  Better than that than the banana .
D :  And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .
C :  I think it worked quite well . Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  say their bit ?
D :  To express them mm mm no .
A :  Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  .
C :  New ideas found . Not quite sure what about . Yeah .
D :  Well it's it's it's pretty new , pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it .
D :  Yeah , neither neither do I , but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a remote control .
C :  Yeah , that's right .
D :  Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Patent patent patent . Mm .
C :  Banana remote .
B :  I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , but we've got no way of finding out .
C :  Yeah . Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . Flip . Vibrate . And uh yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  That vibrates
B :  Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .
C :  Nothing that you really want . True . Yeah .
C :  Okay . So , costs are within budget , well within budget , including a little what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
C :  Um we've evaluated
D :  Yes .
C :  the project . You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ? It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything
B :  And it's fabulous .
B :  It's in the project documents .
C :  that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?
D :  And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . Otherwise it's it's all fine .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah . Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our
B :  Yeah , we've got like five minutes left .
C :  time . We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time .
D :  Yeah .
A :  We certainly are , mm . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
C :  So I would say that's the end of that meeting .
D :  Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .
B :  'Kay .
C :  Thank you , team . It was very productive day and
A :  Yeah , same here .
B :  We could draw animals on the board again .
C :  Mm uh no .
A :  Mm uh no . I don't think so .
D :  You can make some animals . Oh , you don't like anim
B :  I don't like Play-Doh , no . It's just minging . It smells so bad .
D :  It doesn't ? Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet .
B :  It does .
B :  Mm .
C :  Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . I don't know if it's already sent or not . Um presumably I have to
A :  Was there a questionnaire already sent ?
B :  No , it hasn't been .
B :  Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?
C :  I don't see why you can't stay here , really .
B :  Okay , so the other way .
C :  Did I save this one ? Production costs .
D :  I made your animal for you .
C :  It was supposed to be pink . But it was blue on the board .
D :  Yeah , that's the one
