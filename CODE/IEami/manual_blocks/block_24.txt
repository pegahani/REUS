A :  So is Why not save that .
D :  No , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere .
A :  Do you want to replace existing file , no .
A :  I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents , but
D :  Yeah , you have to you have to close that window . 'Cause that's the save one isn't it , so
D :  And then find it .
A :  spreadsheet .
A :  Yeah , but I've ta uh right , I'll just re-do it . That's the easiest way .
A :  Right .
C :  Well we've made our prototype anyway .
C :  We can have a good look at that .
D :  You pass it round to have a look .
C :  Mm-hmm . Y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides .
D :  Mm very nice .
C :  Um , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So it is , yeah . Cherry would be alright actually . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's a bit more fun , isn't it ? And it's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple , you think computers , like Apple Mac .
B :  Yeah , yeah , we might get a
D :  Mm-hmm . Copyright , yeah . What's this this one ? What's that one there ?
C :  Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . Ah , that's the mute .
D :  Oh , okay . Right .
B :  For the M_ .
C :  It it'd probably have to be labelled mute . But um , we didn't have anything small enough to write .
D :  Uh-huh .
B :  They're thinking
D :  Okay .
B :  For the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them . Um , the important ones are the volume ones . So we made them a bit bigger . The mute could possibly be a bit smaller .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there , and the the channel is in blue .
C : 
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  R right . Um , all these things have cost implications . And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button .
C :  Yeah , and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus .
A :  So However , I've now . But um , yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that , and uh as I suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , I suppose .
D :  I'll see if I can find them .
B :  Yeah , sis
C :  Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important , but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . So that's where the colour buttons came from .
D :  Have
A :  An important consideration . Right , okay so um
A :  And the second one underneath would be the idea for the
B :  Yes , we'll have the slide-away .
A :  Right , okay . So we've got um detail design meeting .
B :  Bottom .
A :  Right .
A :  So So , we've got
A :  prototype presentation , which we've just done , evaluation criteria , um and finance , so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting . So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but um obviously obviously it would . But other than that , we got the red apple . We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons , and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . And the and the cost implication . The only snag about this is that uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , yes .
D :  Right .
B :  Okay .
A :  the cost is probably kind of important . So um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture . Um ,
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  and whether it would uh
D :  So if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ?
C :  Uh , that's it .
B :  This this is a yes , this is our presentation of the prototype .
D :  That's the pr
A :  Right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half Euros .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So , there's no redesign . So that should uh Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is
A :  is quickly find that uh
B :  Could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ?
D :  we should plug it in . Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one .
A :  Right .
A :  Okay .
B :  'Kay , Alice .
B :  So , sh
D :  We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .
A :  Right . .
B :  'Kay this should be then .
A :  Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved
A :  case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . So , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Have a push button interface .
A :  Okay . W the button supplements . Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . But So the so the real w the real question then would come in . Do you make all the buttons
B :  Um
B :  Um
D :  Well do we'll do it on the prototype , so do two , see how much it is .
A :  Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . Everything else is gonna be a standard . We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , so , I was originally , I was thinking rubber wasn't special , but according to this , maybe it is . So
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  And then we'd have
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there .
D :  Yeah . I think you just do one , don't you , for the
A :  W I don't know is is is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore I mean , what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore
D :  I think I think it's just it's just a one . Else
A :  Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .
D :  I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button .
A :  Mm . I would Every design change is uh I dunno , um Okay , um ,
D :  I don't know though .
D :  Hmm .
A :  if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . We'd have one special colour and one special button form .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And when
A :  I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half .
A :  As far as I know , that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements . And if What happened ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  You've just gone off the window into another one . It's on the bottom row .
C :  Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . Yeah .
A :  Now , right . Okay , so , but the point would be that if we uh
A :  if we just did special Sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  So that's nine point one there so we've got some
A :  So it Well , is it s is no , it's nine point seven I've got . Okay .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Just give us a bit of
A :  So , that would
A :  that would work out fine if uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor . At the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one . Um , I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , hold on . Um , if we
A :  Okay , that gives us twelve point seven
B :  So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition without
A :  But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the Oh , I see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and
B :  Yeah , yeah . Um
C :  Um , . D wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? You know how you turn that one to a zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , so you need both of them ?
D :  Yeah , we have to have it
B :  Oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe . Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um
A :  And go for battery instead . That would give you one less .
D :  Yeah .
B :  We should Yeah , that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov
A :  But you reckon that i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .
B :  Yeah , yeah . Well , since it's the through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . Um , whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have . And then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not uh You know what I mean ? The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote . So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? In a sense , at the moment , we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two . At least . Remember that was a minimum requirement . The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it originally , we're gonna make it a simple product .
C :  I think the voice recognition .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? Okay . Right um , I have a little thing . So , we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on .
A :  Mm-hmm . Makes sense .
B :  Okay .
A :  .
A :  Sorry , do you want that back up ?
D :  Yeah , I just had a presentation to
A :  Right .
D :  do .
C :  But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery .
A :  Okay , but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm . Right okay um ,
D :  This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess .
D :  And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four .
D :  So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . Um so ,
D :  We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy .
D :  Um
D :  The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use .
D :  Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , so I'll go over here .
B :  Okay .
D :  Right . So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . So if we do a sort of a one
D :  So
B :  Okay , well we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . So uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Um , sorry that'd be considered fancy .
C :  Yeah , I'd maybe give it a
C :  a two .
D :  Of but I think What Is one false , or is t one true ? I forgot . One's true , and okay . Seven's fal Four is neutral , okay . So
C :  One's true .
C :  And a four is neutral .
B :  So maybe maybe a two .
C :  Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true . But it's pretty close . We've got almost everything we can .
A :  Go for one . Yep .
D :  Right .
D :  Okay . Right . I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space .
A :  Okay .
D :  So , false is seven , true is one , and
D :  So uh say about a two for fancy , you think ? Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , why not not , m m maybe nearer three .
D :  Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um
A :  Two three . Well , it's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  This this is just this is just for like the look . Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .
D :  Yeah , so that so sh should we go for a a two on that ?
A :  Okay .
D :  'Kay . And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?
B :  Um , deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .
D :  D yeah .
D :  Okay . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we .
B :  Um
B :  But not the kinetic .
D :  But not the kinetic .
B :  Like the power .
A :  No . 'Cause you can't afford that w we took that out too .
B :  No , we c ca yeah , we can't afford both .
D :  Alright , so
A :  Didn't you ? Or
D :  So it doesn't It's pretty The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the
B :  No may is maybe about neutral plus it it it's got something , but it hasn't got
C :  Maybe a three .
D :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  Well , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options .
C :  I would give it more than a four .
B :  Right .
B :  Okay .
D :  Right , okay .
A :  And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that the other functions we've got in are are more at the The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera ,
B :  'Kay .
A :  if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , which would be come from the button supplements category .
B :  Um
D :  I'm just gonna check my email .
D :  I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um
D :  the product .
C :  How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ?
C :  Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . And then it stand the test of time better .
A :  Um , interface type um , well plastic rather than rubber . That that that would make the significant difference . You could either you could have it If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . And that would enable you to to do it .
D :  Okay . But I
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
B :  So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  , I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or .
A :  Well , okay , but
C :  Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it .
A :  It's rubber as it is , yes .
D :  So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the
D :  both the um
A :  We got we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too
D :  the speech
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah . Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I would've said about a two as well .
D :  Do you reckon a two ?
C :  Yeah , two or three . I'd be happy with a two .
D :  Okay . Two . And the next one is I'll have to get it back up now .
A :  Oh .
A :  The next on Well , I can just sing about . Easy to use . I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , I would say so as well .
A :  Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Well , yeah it certainly has some .
B :  Um
C :  Yeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess .
A :  .
B :  It does , yeah .
D :  Um
A :  Yep .
D :  Say about a three maybe ?
A :  I don't know .
B :  Yeah , m um Yeah , it was just doing it quite well . Um , I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's um
C :  Maybe two ?
A :  Yep .
A :  Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable .
D :  It's a two .
A :  The product is a recognisable real
A :  r uh reaction product ?
D :  Yeah , this is
B :  Uh the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying
D :  This
C :  Yeah , that's a bit rough at the minute .
D :  Yeah .
B :  where it comes from .
D :  So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . So sort of
A :  Oh .
B :  Okay .
D :  Is it sort of a recognisable product . Does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft .
A :  S
D :  What do y
C :  Uh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine .
B :  Also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . Um , it depends which way you look at it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay . So we're going for a
D :  So
B :  Maybe a kind of three ? Uh d
A :  two , three ?
D :  Two or three ?
C :  Yeah , two or three . Well , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . But um ,
A :  Sure .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . And it does have attributes that other products do . Two ? Aye . Go for it .
A :  Right , okay .
D :  Two or three .
A :  Two . Right , come on . That's that decided . Right . So
D :  How
D :  Two . Okay .
D :  Right .
A :  So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then
D :  Yeah .
C :  What does what do all them numbers mean then ? Do we add them up and rate or anything ?
D :  Yeah we s yeah , I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be I'm just gonna do this in my head . One point eight isn't it or something . I think , anyway .
A :  About a two .
A :  Two .
D :  So yeah , pretty close to a two .
B :  Yeah , so it's
D :  So
D :  So it's I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad .
A :  Yep .
B :  So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has . Okay , so we need to
A :  Two b two b two , yeah .
A :  Yes .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .
D :  Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the
A :  Okay , well I put it back on .
B :  So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?
D :  the finances
D :  I'm not sure .
C :  we'll probably have to re-rate it .
A :  Yes , I would've thought so .
B :  Yeah , yeah we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so what was it , control uh F_ eight , wasn't it ?
C :  Ah it's on .
D :  it's come on already .
A :  Oh . Oh . How kind . Right , okay . So , you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . You've got
A :  the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item .
B :  Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us um
A :  That's right .
D :  Mm .
A :  Which gets you
B :  In right within the budget range .
A :  Yes .
C :  Yeah , I think that'd be fine . Because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .
B :  So that's eleven point seven , and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Different different colours , yeah . Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case .
A :  Alright .
B :  Possibly , yeah .
B :  Um
C :  Yeah .
B :  And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of
A :  Okay , so
A :  So we're going for plastic , yes ?
D :  Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but
A :  Yep .
D :  And then
B :  Oh yeah , and that would now be Yeah , that's that's within the budget . Um
B :  Do we actually have Do we just have one special uh special forms down here ?
A :  Well , uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them . You got special colour . Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour .
B :  Um
C :  Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons .
B :  And we we've we've got we've got enough for another we've got nought point eight left , so we've got enough for another
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , we've got special form . Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special So so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same . The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .
B :  Yeah , um
B :  But the but but but the
B :  I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different , I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . Yeah , which I think we should Yeah , they'll still be fine for the for the price .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . So , special colour , you want three in there .
A :  Okay .
D :  Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , you know . One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe .
A :  That makes sense .
B :  Okay , uh that's probably it .
D :  Okay . So we only ne we only need two for that . 'Cause I mean these these are moulded . The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber , isn't it .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Yeah , I would agree with that , I think . So special colours , two .
D :  Right .
A :  And we've got special form is the one apple . The rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? Was that the idea ?
B :  Ne uh
C :  Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit .
B :  Maybe that'll be a second supplement . Then there's a spe a second special form .
D :  Yeah , that
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh-huh . I would have thought that's probably about r well .
B :  Um
B :  Well you got you got twelve .
D :  Okay , so tha
B :  So I think that should still be okay . Yeah , that's twelve point three , so we're still
A :  Right .
B :  within budget on that . Um
A :  Yep , that makes sense .
B :  So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the
A :  Yep .
A :  I woulda said so . Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two .
B :  That's without
D :  So shall we do a Well , um
B :  Yeah .
B :  And specially it definitely could fits the the real product What was the what's the company name ?
C :  Real Reactions ?
A :  Real Reaction produ I'm not quite sure , what does that mean ?
B :  R yeah . Yeah , yeah . I mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , so
B :  c type company , then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on
D :  Uh
A :  Yep I would s
D :  So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . Like we got a cherry one . Maybe other ones could be something else shaped . I don't know . That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different
B :  Um
A :  You mean of
D :  seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well , I don't know .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you're making a red apple . So next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon . Yeah , l a lemon lemon or something . And that
D :  Well you could
B :  Yeah so it's a
D :  Yeah .
B :  Whatever fruit was in fashion next year .
D :  Yeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe .
A :  amount
D :  Okay .
D :  So , we've what have we what have we rid of . We got rid of
D :  the plastic .
A :  Yeah , we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? We've
D :  Is it The rubber .
B :  That yeah , that was uh that was just about all . I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ? I dunno . And that is like the most standard type of button .
D :  But uh
D :  So I mean , we've got we got rid of the rubber case , but
D :  we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them .
B :  Yeah .
B :  And everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so
A :  Well , ease has certainly stayed .
B :  Yeah , plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . And what about the sort of innovation ?
B :  to use .
D :  Do you think
B :  Um , well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um
D :  Okay .
A :  And the speech feature .
B :  Yeah , the speech feature .
D :  And then , the corporate identity .
B :  I think we've cut just about the same . We've maybe lost
B :  Hasn't it It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect
A :  How it would play out , yeah . Oh .
D :  Yeah . Whether whether that's considered to be sort of
D :  part of the corporate identity , I don't know .
B :  Um
D :  I mean , it's maybe not . I mean
B :  But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But either way , I think we've made it fairly close to what
D :  Yeah . Okay , well I mean
C :  Yeah , I don't see how we could make it any more .
D :  We cou
C :  Um , apart from maybe
C :  doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But then what colour would you make the R_s ?
B :  just the the company logo . So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick-on badge . So you're in a sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo . And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Hey , what what what's the company colour ? Did you get told what the company colour is or
B :  I'm still not quite sure we've established that .
C :  No , I just We got the logo off the web browser .
A :  Don't think so . But but i but in the sense that , as you saw with um the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter . There's virtually n The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is , so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . Fact , they've got black and white or black and silver . So basically , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it .
D :  Oh right .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
D :  Uh-huh . 'Cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to .
A :  You could put in another Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . So you were talking about uh um We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard .
D :  Another colour . Or would that be t
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  m may or may not be the case .
D :  Yeah . Shall we save the point two for profitability then ?
B :  Um
A :  Well , yeah . Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?
C :  Um , I don't think they would really need to be . I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine . Needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well .
B :  Yeah , maybe we've m
B :  Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and um , fit the kind of idea of what they want . And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah . I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . So , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important .
A :  Yeah , well
A :  Alright . Okay .
D :  'Cause you Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  So
A :  So we just add that to profitability in effect .
D :  Yeah , I mean so we've dropped the cost , but
A :  Right , so we're meant to finish up in five minutes .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Same sort of function ? The criteria ? It's alright . Just made a load of money .
B :  'Kay .
C :  Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel .
C :  'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all .
D :  Well , but I think we said that w
D :  Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons . le lemon sh
C :  Alright . Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? On the volume ones ?
D :  I think well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . Or something like that . Yeah .
C :  Right .
B :  Uh , . That's good .
B :  Definitely lemon shaped .
D :  Did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? Or was it the other way around ?
B :  You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . So I think we can we're okay .
D :  Right , okay .
A :  Mm-hmm . So we're okay this way around .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So that so we've saved
A :  Until the design team comes in and says , get off . But you are the design team .
B :  Then we say it's fine , so it's all good .
D :  Saved two Euros on that .
A :  So what bit are we on to ?
C :  Um , can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ? And did we make it a cherry officially ? Right .
A :  Yeah . I th I th Oh . Right , okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like .
A :  Oh drats , I've botched that , haven't I .
C :  So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ?
D :  Well , we're aiming for um one for all of them .
D :  M but it really has to fit into the budget , so
C :  Right .
D :  I guess we just have to adjust things to
D :  get it i in the
D :  Which is fair enough .
B :  And we seem to have least something in each criteria .
D :  Yeah .
B :  We haven't completely left anything out , so
D :  Yeah , I think
D :  most
B :  As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved
D :  Yeah .
B :  everything .
D :  Yep .
C :  So do we have anything else to discuss ?
D :  I don't know . What's on the agenda ?
A :  Right , okay um
A :  What's happened here ?
A :  Right , okay um
A :  Mm .
A :  Right , okay um , Right . So we got
B :  We've got the closing .
A :  So we've done the
A :  the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign . So we're now on to project process .
A :  Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . So , we're actually now uh , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  So what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain . So , um
D :  Finish your meeting now .
B :  We should just go through this quickly and then
C :  Huh .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So
A :  I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do .
D :  Okay .
A :  So , uh I think I have to finish that page . Right , okay , so
D :  Oh .
A :  Project evaluation . So , um
A :  Creativity .
A :  Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough ? Well um
B :  Um , yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .
A :  Individual meetings . How do you mean ?
D :  Yeah . Well , we were finding out various things in
A :  In you on your own .
D :  in be in-between the meetings , and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . You know , you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that .
A :  Um
A :  Mm , The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . Then you go away . You find out information . You then come back . You then discuss it . You then go and change things around , and then go back . So
D :  Yeah .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant .
A :  Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source , so it's not uh well uh Anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? I've put , seemed okay . Creativity , seemed okay . Um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . I mean a remote control isn't the most um
D :  Yeah , the thing itself .
C :  kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing .
A :  Um
D :  Yeah .
C :  I can't think of a better example at the minute .
A :  Have could have used a different
A :  example pel to increase create
D :  Yeah .
B :  Is this go It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then
A :  Creativity .
B :  something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so
D :  Yeah . But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . I mean it depends what sort of business you're in , I guess . I mean this one seems . From the website it looks it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's , you know , fifteen quid .
B :  one of those things . Like uh , companies can have like a range of products and
A :  I th I uh d
B :  I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of
A :  But the other thing is that uh they're I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . I mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer um for um you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question . And then you or the idea is that the whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or uh or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So uh , and that was a project I suspect similar to this , because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um to enable it to work . And of course , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong . So
D :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well , sh we look at the last slide , see if it's got anything else . I think there's one one more to go .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright , so we've got uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  I mean if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction , I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . And
A :  New ideas found , did we find any , no .
B :  It was quite good with this um the white board , having that and the digital pens . Like , that's something that made it a little easier .
A :  Alright . Leadership , teamwork .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  we did find a new idea , I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . I've never seen one of them before . batteries , I think . So
B :  voice recognition , especially not could
A :  Does
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  You've got voice recognition computers , that's not remote controls .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well it's a different application of it .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay ,
B :  Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .
D :  Mm .
A :  so how do you reckon teamwork went ?
B :  Um
D :  That went okay , yeah .
B :  Yeah , I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .
D :  Mm-hmm , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  To uh go uh reasonably well . Okay .
D :  I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything
A :  Bit bit arbitrary .
D :  Well , I mean I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . I mean , they've got all these sort of , you know ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  high definition D_V_D_ and
D :  portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , and uh I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . Surely they they should produ
A :  So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing .
C :  Well leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager . You were the leader . So our experience of leadership wasn't really
A : 
C :  as much as yours .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Now , I'd much rather be in marketing but I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked . However , um Alright uh means , so whiteboard um so really , it's uh equipment . Oh .
D :  Yeah . It worked . Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but
C :  Yeah , very nice .
C :  But I mean , I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these . I mean , they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? Where do you get the recording ? Do you plug the computer or something ?
D :  I think there's a little there's a little um chi
B :  So it's not just for us , it's for the experiment as a whole , so
D :  There's a little there's a little chip , I think you must plug it into something and it produces a
B :  Should we quickly look at the last slide ? Sh
C :  Right . I think you watch a video of it kind of .
D :  I don't know . Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something , and Page after page .
A :  Right . New ideas found , so one or two .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Kinetic powered remote control . Um ,
D :  what was the other one ?
C :  Voice um recognition thing .
D :  Vo yeah .
A :  um
A :  and uh
A :  uh , was it voice activated um
D :  Voice recognition , yeah . S
A :  recognition .
D :  Almost . To fill in these fill in these questionnaires
C :  Pretty much .
A :  Right , so , uh are the costs within budget , yes . Is the project evaluated , yes . Uh , don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . Then celebration .
D :  Oh no .
B :  . Is that everything ?
D :  Hmm ? I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Uh , so we don't re So really
A :  I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere . Mind you , the the figure last was was different , but it should be poss
A :  Alright , that did nothing . Okay . Welcome to the meeting everyone .
A :  Just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show .
A :  Sorry guys .
D :  You may have to do the function F_ eight thing . Oh , okay .
A :  I did . Twice .
A :  This'll just take a moment .
B :  Okay okay
A :  Or it won't .
A :  Okay we'll have to deal with it like this then . Alright . Um . This is the first meeting uh for developing our , our new product . I'm Heather , I'm your Project Manager .
B :  Okay .
B :  Hello .
A :  Okay . So um . So that was the opening . The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name .
B :  Okay . My name's Poppy . I'm the Industrial Designer for this project . Um , I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product .
A :  Nice to meet you Poppy .
B :  Okay .
C :  My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer . I will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design .
A :  Alright .
D :  Hi , I'm Genevieve . I'm the Marketing Expert . I'm an expert at marketing . Um , I'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product . Um , I'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase .
A :  Alright I'm Heather and I've
A :  I said I'm your Project Manager , um
A :  Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing . But um um
A :  Yeah .
A :  And uh tool training
A :  is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , uh Which brings us to our next subject , is , um , um , as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control .
A :  Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design .
B :  Okay .
B :  So this is a television remote control ? Yeah .
A :  Yes , it's a television remote control .
A :  Right . I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . So , alright .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um , yeah .
A :  Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um
A :  come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . Same with conceptual design and detailed design .
A :  So , um ,
A :  making sure that it , it's usable , that as a , um
A :  and that it's , it's feasible to create , and uh ,
A :  to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . Um , tool training . Is , is everyone , um
A :  Okay . Great . Great . Um
B :  Yeah . Got those notes .
D :  Yeah . Thank you .
A :  One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . Um , one of them is our whiteboard . And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . So , um , I , I'm assuming that we should do that now .
B :  Okay .
A :  'Kay . With our microphones still attached to our bodies . Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  Gosh .
A :  'Kay , what's my favourite animal ?
A :  Do come up .
B :  Oh , to go first . Oh , are we all doing it individually ?
A :  This is a team-building time where , um , , okay cool , um
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , let's stand up and support you
A :  My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay ,
A :  right now it is an elk . alright , so
C :  An elk ? A vicious
B :  Okay .
A :  And it goes like
A :  Yeah it's got like big antlers , yeah .
A :  Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head .
B :  Do you have elk where you come from ?
A :  Yes . Yeah we have moose and we have deer .
D :  We have moose too .
B :  You do .
B :  Okay .
A :  Do you have
C :  We have sheep .
B :  Sheep . Yeah , cows .
A :  'Kay , um .
B :  That's a great elk . Yeah .
D :  Uh-oh , we have a good artist .
C :  That is really good . I'm quite
A :  Thanks . This is my
D :  Oh , very shapely .
B :  Brilliant .
A :  Okay . That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , that um , that um In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh
A :  it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . Right .
B :  Very nice . Okay .
A :  Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals .
B :  Okay , I'll go next . I am a big animal lover . I like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently .
D :  Oh .
A :  Oh .
B :  It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , but never mind .
B :  Not as artistic as Heather's drawing . Bit more cartoon style . But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing . Uh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . They know what they want . Basically , that's why I like cats .
C :  Very good .
A :  Great .
B :  I'll rub that out .
B :  There you go .
C :  Okay . I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure how to draw one . I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw . Um ,
B :  Ooh .
A :  I forget her name .
C :  right it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog .
D :  or Tara .
B :  Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog .
C :  It's a cartoon dog I think . A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . It's a scary cartoon dog .
C :  That This , that does not look like a dog . I'm sorry .
B :  We can pretend .
A :  It looks kinda like a person .
D :  That's Pinocchio .
C :  How do you draw a dog ? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god . Right . Yous know what it's supposed to be . It's a dog . . Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . And , like they're more of a companion than cats . I've nothing against cats . Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them . But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , that don't look like that .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , that's true .
D :  Alrighty . I feel like a robot . Okay . Um , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . It was like , well it was a little pointier than that .
D :  At first I thought it was a dead leaf . And then it landed on the wall next to me . But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . And then it kinda there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this .
A :  It's kinda like a peacock .
D :  Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . So I thought that was pretty cool . And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . I wish I'd had my camera . So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . Yeah . There you go .
B :  Very nice .
A :  Great .
D :  Uh , what do we Oh .
A :  Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ?
D :  Yes I do .
A :  Yea
A :  Right .
A :  So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um
B :  Okay .
A :  we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um
A :  to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents .
D :  Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? Twelve fifty .
A :  I'm bad at math . 'Kay . Um , so now that , um , that is underway , um
D :  Okay .
A :  it is discussion time . So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um
A :  suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them .
A :  Does anyone have any initial thoughts ?
D :  I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing .
A :  Mm-hmm . So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Um
B :  I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . It's always , where is the remote control ? So maybe if you could have some kind of
C :  Yeah .
B :  tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . I dunno , some kind of alarm . You can press a button on your wall , signal , 'cause it always gets lost .
A :  Yeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea .
C :  Do yous not find that , um ,
C :  like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do . Yeah , I don't know what they do .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , that you don't use half of them .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . That's useful . So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's , that's Yeah , it is . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . Anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like
A :  Any ideas will do that you have at this point .
D :  Could be shaped like a conch , you know . Be like a shell-shaped remote .
B :  Mm .
A :  Can hold it . Yeah .
B :  A novelty . Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . Like , I've seen phones like a Okay .
A :  Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . So , hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . Um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right . Okay we have five minutes left . So , just to cover We have one more thing . Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . Or not present but bring to the meeting . Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Interface ? Oh , industrial .
B :  Industrial Designer . That's me .
A :  Industrial Designer . I have to remember these things . Um .
A :  You'll be beginning your , your working design . Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . And I'll see you in half an hour , okay ? 'Kay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Marketing Expert .
B :  Okay . Thank you .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . That's okay . That's okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Am I starting now ?
A :  Anytime ? Oh sorry . 'Kay , um . Alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . Um , and um , I'll be taking minutes on this one , and um Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself , because it'll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . Um , so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation . And , um
A :  So , sorry ? So , um , take it away Poppy .
B :  Okay . Um , do I need to plugged in .
A :  It's , it's plugged in . So , um
C :  F_ eight , w . Function F_ eight .
B :  F_ okay . Function F_ eight . Sorry about this guys .
A :  No problem .
B :  'Kay . is on .
B :  Right .
B :  Okay . I will take this time just to apologise . I , I only , uh , received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . But there we go . Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be .
A :  I'm sure it's fine .
B :  Um , from
B :  Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . A automatically , um lights up at first touch . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark .
B :  Um , also we could use um an alarm . So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . Um , so that would work . Um , oop . Go back there .
B :  Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart .
B :  So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .
A :  Right , um , one question . This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ? So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  And then
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? Or would we contribute to another group ?
B :  You could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . For a certain percentage at least . Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , but
A :  Alright .
A :  Okay . This sounds like a really great idea . One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well I the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed . Like , you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . Because of this , their properties are smart material . All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves . So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright . We'll still have to investigate the financial implications .
A :  Alright . I like the environmental approach . Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Um also
B :  there is um components . This'll be how it uh will actually work . But I haven't put this plan together yet .
B :  There we go . Sorry , should I go back .
A :  I'm sorry , could you Those were um
B :  This would actually show the circuit diagram . Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . So I just put all those components in .
A :  Okay .
A :  So those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote . Those are all the
B :  Yeah . I it just shows what sort of energy source . It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . Um , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . Okay ?
A :  Alright . Great .
B :  So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? Or escape ?
B :  There we go .
B :  Okay .
A :  Alright . Thank you very much .
B :  Thank you .
A :  And , um , the next presenter will be Tara .
B :  There you go Tara .
C :  Thanks .
C :  Can you see ?
D :  Oh ,
C :  Do you think
C :  Is it uh , function eight yeah ?
B :  Function F_ eight . The one at the top .
D :  Function F_ eight .
A :  Yeah . Function F_ eight . Sorry .
C :  Oh right . Okay .
D :  That looks right .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  I'm the User um
C :  User Interface Designer . Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . There're two functional design options . A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television .
D :  I'm sorry , what was that last one . Multifunctional and
C :  Sorry . Um , a single function just for the television itself .
D :  Ch Oh , I see .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing .
C :  A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .
D :  'Kay .
C :  Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable .
C :  Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . And less functions would have to be included .
C :  So it would be cheaper to make . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices .
C :  Does anyone have any questions ?
D :  So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?
C :  Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , yeah , other entertainment devices .
D :  Right .
D :  D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ? Okay .
A :  Right .
A :  Does everyone agree with this ? Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ?
B :  Um , I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . And limit the design . Do you think ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . So
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . That's true . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . We'll have more money to go into the design side of it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  Alright . Sounds great .
D :  Mm , 'kay .
A :  Alright , well , um , are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ?
D :  Yes I am .
A :  Fabulous . Except you're not hooked up to the Great .
D :  Oh , I'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Oh . I just lost my microphone .
A :  No problem , we can
D :  Just a moment . Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . Um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . And I'll show you my findings .
D :  Oh , and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . So I think that should be our priority here . Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . So that it's something that fits in the household .
A :  I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ?
D :  Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , um , to influence our remote control .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , so the findings . Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . Which is a , quite a significant number . Um , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .
A :  I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ?
D :  Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . Um , so it is something that people care about . It's not , it's not ignored in the household . Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . They're you know thumb-masters . Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . That A very small amount . Thought that was interesting .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button .
B :  Mm .
B :  the single function . Yeah .
D :  Yes .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah that's a good point .
D :  And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . And uh how important the uh users find them . So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set .
D :  Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . That's a huge amount . This is the most important button . Um , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . Relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . Uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . And it's used on average four times an hour . Not as much as channel selection , but still significant .
D :  Um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . Relevance is two . Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . Um , and relevance of one point five . We're getting to specific statistics here . Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . I don't know if you can help me . Flipping pages .
C :  It's um
D :  Is that
B :  It's like the news . Or like information .
C :  It has T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . No , li Yeah .
B :  The and what's on .
A :  Yeah . It's um No it's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up . I haven't used it before but
D :  So like a running banner , underneath
C :  Yeah .
D :  Oh .
C :  And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up .
B :  It's like
B :  It's like very basic internet . Sort of , um
D :  Okay .
C :  Very basic internet , yeah . But you have Yeah . But you have no interaction back with it , you know . Like the internet you can send emails and You've no interaction .
D :  Okay . Like tells you the weather , and Okay .
B :  Yeah , it's just information that um , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and
D :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright . Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . Um , channel settings . Zero point zero one times an hour . Relevance of three . Channel settings .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ? Tuning them in at the very start . You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels , do you th do you think ? Yeah . Yeah .
D :  P Sorry . Changing the channels ?
D :  Oh , okay .
B :  To get the right reception and picture , I suppose .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  Mm .
D :  Um , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . Okay .
D :  Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . Remote controls are often lost somewhere . So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . So it should be very user-friendly , you know . People know what to do very quickly . Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ .
D : 
B :  Repetitive strain injury .
C :  Repeti Uh .
D :  Ah . Is that what it is ? People with arthritis and such ?
B :  I think .
A :  That's rather sad .
C : 
D :  Um , maybe our
B :  Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . I'm not
C :  Yeah , yeah . I think it is .
D :  designers can look into that . Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . That's a problem .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . It is .
D :  Okay . Did you guys uh get that one down ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
D :  Um okay , here's some ideas for you . A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . So I'll show you some numbers here .
D :  Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount .
D :  Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . And if we have the budget for it . Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .
A :  I agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . Um , financially and and functionally . Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . Um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
D :  So that , that's a whole other field of research . I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . Um and depending on how many members you have in households . So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself . Wonder if it would have
D :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design . Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . If we're looking for a simplistic design , if We need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design . Um , because if , if it is then I think voice , um voice-activated
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
D :  It looks like
A :  Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  It'd be like the ultimate remote .
D :  Um okay . And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . Not practical . Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Um , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is .
D :  Oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . S Or like um
C :  Mobile phone . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Or Like an alarm clock . You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock .
B :  Mm .
B :  What , what would appear on the screen ?
A :  I have no idea still . I'm sorry .
D :  Oh just like an electronic screen . As opposed to just buttons . There would be like a little , like on Yeah . Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little L_C_D_ screen . Um , now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting .
A :  Oh , on the remote . Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Could it it It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . But that would probably be
B :  Like linked in with the teletext , or sort of like an
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . That would be good , yeah .
B :  teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Might be quite expensive to do that though .
B :  Mm , Yeah .
B :  Could be .
D :  Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research . Um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . Um , I think our priority really should be unique design . Um , we want something that people want in their home . Every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique .
A :  Right .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product Um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  stick to the basics .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out and , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Right . And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Early twenties , that's the kind of age group . Twenties .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm . Okay .
D :  Yep .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright .
D :  Okay . That's it for the market research .
A :  Okay . Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . Um , for one thing , because Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Um , for many reasons . So um we have that decision sort of made for us . Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . Yep .
B :  Can I just interrupt ?
B :  Would you like to plug in your Have you got a PowerPoint or not ? Okay . Thanks .
D :  Yeah . Maybe we can do the
A :  Okay , sure .
A :  Yeah I do . I'm looking at looking at it right now .
D :  There you go .
A :  thank you .
D :  Oh , come back screen .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ?
A :  Um , well , I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  Alright , and another thing . This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um
A :  more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , um , all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . So , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . Um , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company but , another thing is that , um
B :  Right .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Just
A :  we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .
B :  Okay . Work on that .
D :  It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  The little R_ R_ yellow thing ? Okay . Real Reaction ?
D :  Yeah , I think .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Um , yes , those are the changes . Um , so , now we need to discuss , um
A :  and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television . It'll It won't have teletext . But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay , so I Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? Yeah ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Is that how most people feel about that ? Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition .
C :  I think it would be annoying though if I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if
A :  Yeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , um , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous .
C :  You'd Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Never heard of it .
C :  So is it just Okay . Alright . Right .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ . Do you know if anywhere else has it ?
C :  I don't know .
B :  I don't know . More research required , I think . But if Was it a management decision that we're having Okay . So
C :  I don't know .
A :  Alright .
A :  It was a management decision , so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay then .
A :  'Kay .
A :  So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple .
D :  Um , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Um .
B :  Minimal
D :  And the What was the word they used ? F findability is important .
A :  Yeah . I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . 'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared
B :  Yeah okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . The same signalling . I mean
A :  the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . It's not that expensive to do .
B :  Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . Like you just a , a buzz or something . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Okay . I like that idea .
C :  Would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? 'Cause uh isn't our remote control for
C :  all T_V_s , so
C :  you'd ha
B :  If Do you mean the the link between the Well , if the button was actually on
C :  Yeah , with the button that you pressed . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . The button Oh .
B :  Oh , yeah .
C :  C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something .
A :  Minor detail there .
B :  Maybe Yeah , yeah . Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive . Obviously something small that's Yeah , that's a good point .
A :  Yeah , it would have t
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Would it need a battery then ?
A :  Maybe , um
B :  Pr probably . Unless it could be Okay . Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . I mean the power for the T_V_ . So , mm , more research into that one . Yeah .
A :  Probably , I mean . That's your department you'll have to sort that out .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , you'll have to Yeah , you'll have to investi Do some research on that , alright ? Great . Um , alright , and I'm sure that , um
D :  Mm .
A :  um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . Is everyone interested in that ?
D :  On the buttons ?
C :  I I like the light up suggestion . I think that would be better . 'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  it doesn't It could it could be a tactile thing as well . Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . And there's something on it . S you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . Um , and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . S
C :  I would go for
B :  Like a raised
C :  Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? Like raised .
D :  The numbers themselves . But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing .
C :  Yeah . Could be raised .
C :  Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah
A :  Hmm .
D :  I just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . I'm not sure .
C :  Yeah .
B :  That's true . And also y , uh Heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody . Um , so like big b um buttons , for people you are visually impaired . The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway . So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody .
A :  Yeah . But I mean
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That , I think that's good , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Could we somehow We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  No , it's not these days . I mean , it's quite easily accessible .
C :  No , I wouldn't say so .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , so if , if you're like changing the volume during a movie . I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . And you don't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby . Um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it . It lights up for
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  That's good Yeah that a good idea .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  That , yeah , that's a good idea .
D :  On self timer .
B :  So self-timed lighting .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Alright we have five minutes left
B :  Um , I
A :  um , for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . Um , what was I missed the last moment , reading that . What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ?
D :  Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it . Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . So
B :  So , self-timed
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so That's probably feasible . So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . And I think that's un unique as well . I mean , I haven't seen that . And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . For visually impaired , yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , yeah . And it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ? Yeah . Yeah instead of like hard buttons . Okay . Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? Like should we do both ? Or we can have one or the other ? Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with .
B :  durable .
B :  Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Repetitive strain injury . Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh right , the
C :  Yeah .
C :  If
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I was gonna say ,
D :  Exactly . It the it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . It's kind of like Eighties neon-style . Um , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . So
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , and we could Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , which could like link in with the company colours . Like it could be blue or green or yellow , or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right . Right .
A :  Alright . So we've decided on lighting up things .
C :  I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised .
B :  Yeah . Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . Or , or the , whate
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . But with the same thing , I mean . If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well . Is Are you okay with that ? Okay . Cool . Um
D :  That's true .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . So I think that um
A :  that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions . And now it's up to designing . And um making sure that this can be feasible . And do you have anything Do you have anything to say ?
B :  Is
D :  What um Oh sorry .
D :  Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . So I I dunno if there's something that
D :  diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Um
B :  Okay . Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . Yeah , or Okay .
C :  Oh yeah . Interchangeable thing ?
D :  Yeah ,
A :  Like an iPod or something ? Okay .
C :  That would be good . Yeah .
D :  Exactly , like an iPod . Exactly . Or , or like mobile ph . And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . Like a Bart Simpson faceplate . But
A :  Like a cellphone ? Yeah .
C :  Yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . Y Could buy extra
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Accessories .
D :  Mm-hmm . Exactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .
B :  Person
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Well , that's great .
C :  That's a good idea . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think that we should incorporate that .
B :  Interchangeable . Um , als
A :  'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all . You'd just get one mould ,
C :  No .
B :  Yeah . Interchan
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  throw some plastic in it , you know .
B :  And also possible I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah . But if we , there is Yeah . We could Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again .
C :  If w
A :  Right . We'll have to do more research . Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . Um , does it need to be reached a de Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? Because we need to investigate the financial implications .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um , I've
B :  Okay . Let's
A :  Okay .
A :  Is it Does it need to be uh decided on now ? Or should we
B :  I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then .
A :  Okay .
A :  Good . Alright then . Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ?
C :  No .
B :  No .
A :  Alright , well .
A :  Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later . Alright ?
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Thank you .
A :  Is everyone ready to start ? Okay . Great . Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
A :  Okay . Um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . The meeting will be forty minutes long . And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Thank you .
A :  Okay .
B :  Should be just loading .
B :  Okay . Oh , although I can't see it on my screen .
B :  That says go here .
B :  Okay . I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . Which is where all the main information is uh contained . Um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . Um , and all their positioning in the circuit .
A :  Um
A :  Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ?
B :  Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . We can go into that later . Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . A bit out of date . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed .
A :  Um
A :  What is a hand-powered dynamo ?
B :  Um , where you manually charge up the power . Like you wind up something . Sorry ? Yeah . Every once in a while I think . But it's
A :  Just every , every once in a while ?
A :  Just every once in a while or constantly ?
A :  Alright . It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think .
B :  Yeah . It would be like going a step back in time . I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way .
C :  Yeah .
A :  No .
A :  Right .
B :  Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . Or too small . Or too slidy . I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . Because you can't really see which way round it is .
D :  Mm .
A :  Right .
B :  Um , we also can choose what materials um , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . Wood . Um , again , stepping back in time again there . I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . But , would've been maybe for future projects .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um right our choice for buttons as well . We've developed some we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . I think that was brought up for , um , they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . You can just slide up and down . I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . It , it we would have to have an L_C_D_ um
B :  Yeah . That's true . And that would lead to an advanced yeah . If we have yeah . We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . It's the most straightforward . But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . . Got decisions to make there . And this is what I was just saying before . Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . Um simple would go with the pushbutton .
A :  display , and the glow in the dark thing
A :  might be difficult .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um , regular you could link with the scroll button . And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display . My personal preferences ? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . I don't , I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology . It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . You just give it a shake . Sounds brilliant to me .
A :  Right .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . Um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one .
A :  Uh .
A :  Yeah . Um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  like as the exterior . This is the one thing that's protecting its innards .
B :  I think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . And the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . Um , is it I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . It would work that way .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable .
C :  Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top
B :  Yeah . Like I can't think of what .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , b like a Nokia it is . It's yeah .
B :  Yeah . Or like an you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just it's protective as well . It , it stops it , I mean , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily . I think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Like the skin ? Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . So maybe the
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . Okay . And the buttons obviously are rubber .
B :  And then yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  That sounds good . I , um , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?
B :  As far as I know . It should be .
A :  Okay , we'll just say yeah . Yes , just why not . Alright . I like the kinetic energy source idea . Um , I don't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot . But I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um
B :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah . I thought that was
C :  Yeah , tha
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  energy source . It could make an we could have any kind of style . It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Just for environmental reasons .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before .
B :  Yeah .
D :  So it seems we'd have to do more research on it . Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack .
B :  Yeah . Like as a backup for something .
C :  Backup . Yeah .
D :  Yeah so there's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries I believe . So , if it was running off of one battery as a
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  That would be good yeah .
B :  Yeah . Some alternative just in case something went wrong .
D :  Right .
C :  Maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power . So maybe that could be incorporated as
B :  That's true . I just thought of that . Yeah . Yeah . May maybe that could be the backup . Instead of a battery . Like solar backup .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Although it needs some light , doesn't it ?
B :  Yeah . I suppose s but some
C :  Do , do those calculators yeah .
A :  Yeah , you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then .
D :  So , if we're doing yeah . If we're
B :  But thing is , it's not you don't need the solar all the time . It can be stored . It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . Like a few hours a day . .
C :  I don't know how it works .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think that might be a little impractical though .
D :  Yeah . I think sometimes it's just shoved under , under a cushion , and yeah .
B :  That's true . It could easily
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Like people don't wanna have to worry about that .
B :  Yeah . I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , I forgot to charge my remote today . Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . You don't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . And it works . Yeah . Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it .
C :  Yeah , I suppose .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . Cool .
B :  K okay .
A :  'S that the end of your presentation . Alright . Thank you .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  There we go .
C :  Thanks .
C :  Oh .
C :  It's not on my screen . Why ?
B :  it wasn't on mine either . I don't know why . I think , I just , I just used the mouse on there .
C :  You don't know why ? Oh okay .
C :  Is it that one ?
A :  Yeah . That's um
B :  Yeah .
C :  Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user .
C :  And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data .
C :  Um , there are two types of user interfaces . There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about .
A :  Oh . Okay . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . Or maybe it's
B :  Mm .
C :  the the buttons or pictures or something .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah . So I suppose sometime after you .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , 'cause I'm sorry ? Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . You're pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want .
C :  Do you think it's
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . Like an L_C_D_ screen .
B :  I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol . And if you wanted to go onto teletext or , I know we're not having that , but I mean a similar thing , you , they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which I suppose it's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button . But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that . It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , we'll be doing
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . It'd be more a command interface , and then
C :  Yeah .
B :  I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ?
D :  The infrared is like , that's considered a
B :  I
A :  Hmm ?
C :  No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per
D :  Okay . So when it says pointing device that doesn't include
B :  For inp
C :  Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen .
A :  Yeah . I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things .
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  But um
C :  I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic . But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points , as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  What do you mean ?
C :  Like I can't think of an example , but
C :  Sort of like little pictures rather than
A :  Oh yeah , like how the buttons
C :  Like a little sound . Instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something . Yeah , something y
A :  Yeah , as a button though . So , it's a keyboard in the shape of it , right ? Okay . Yeah . I like that idea .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah m perha yeah . Yeah . Maybe .
C :  Um , the co uh we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . As it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly .
C :  Um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . You know , make it more trendy and original . We'll have more money if we keep it simple .
A :  Yeah . I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  A bit more too , yeah .
C :  Seeing as it's quite a new technology . Um
C :  We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful .
B :  Yeah . That's true . That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things . It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And that all interfaces are different . So , um , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand .
C :  And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yep .
C :  Does anyone have any questions ?
A :  Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look .
C :  Mm .
D :  I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to . Just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , so and , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  But um
A :  But what about the lighting up effect ?
D :  You mean different colours for the lighting or
A :  Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh I see what you're saying .
D :  Well y
A :  If they were white they would glow , probably . If they were made out of rubber .
D :  Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .
B :  Oh .
D :  But , but I guess , you mean from the back . Okay .
A :  Oh . Where would the light come from ?
B :  I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  Yeah , and well rubber is a more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It should be able to mm-hmm .
C :  In the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the um covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber . So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . Do you know what I mean ? 'Cause it's just the wee control , yeah , thing that's behind it .
B :  Li yeah .
D :  Oh . Yeah . They , they insert over .
A :  Oh .
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  So
C :  I mean , we don't have to decide on one colour . Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well , if they're raised up buttons . So that you can feel them . We were talking about it being more
C :  Yeah .
A :  um , a lot more tangible . Um , it might be more difficult to do . If they're , if they're sticking up . If it's flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I think it would be possible . I don't think it would make that much difference . I mean , the uh the dimensions of it . 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . And then you get to the circuit . I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty . I'm sure that'd be fine .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Alright .
C :  Yeah .
A :  If it's do-able we can do . Yeah , sounds good to me .
C :  So that's everything , then ?
B :  Okay .
A :  Alright , thank you .
D :  Okay is that my turn then ?
A :  That means you're up . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright .
D :  I have a shorter report for you today . Um , it took a while to get this , uh
D :  Uh .
B :  You're not plugged in yet .
D :  Oh . That's a very good point .
D :  Okay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . Sorry . There we go .
D :  Um So , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris . And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote . Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed .
D :  Um , so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . Um , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it . Uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . Um , this should be our priority , as we've been saying .
D :  The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . So , I think we've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the
D :  face-plates . Um , so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that . And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use .
D :  So , pretty basic there .
D :  And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
D :  Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons .
D :  Um
D :  So , my personal preferences here ,
D :  um of course , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes . It could be one of the options . Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . And then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only
A :  area that I find rather jarring . Everything else we can really , we can really
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It is strange .
A :  um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control .
D :  It's , it's a little but it , it's everywhere . So maybe we I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know . But I I think , I think if we stick to T_V_ based , you know , maybe T_V_ shows , or
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But they still need to um fit into people's decor though .
D :  Or colour schemes .
B :  We
D :  Right .
B :  I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . Or a strawberry seed or a leaf . Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . Instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit yeah . It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme . But may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know . But initially , I dunno . I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit .
D :  Yeah . The
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  The essence of strawberry . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Tone it down . Yeah , like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product .
B :  Yeah and like not , not yeah .
D :  I guess , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Or banana-shaped .
D :  One thing I was thinking though is I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . So maybe there could be animal-based , you know . Because a lot of people have a house cat . Or , or a dog .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Um , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . But it's something to keep in mind .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And , did you have any questions ?
D :  Pretty straightforward ?
A :  Yeah um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Alright , given that information ,
A :  we need to start making some more specific decisions .
A :  So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again .
D :  There you go .
D :  Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the okay .
B :  I didn't for the first one . But I have now . Yeah . Uh , hopefully . Project documents I think .
A :  But it's still around right ? Okay .
C :  Where do you have to save it to ?
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  I'm just trying to make this pop up now .
A :  Alright . Here we go .
A :  Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . So energy , we oh .
B :  Okay .
A :  Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Does anyone know how to take it out of
A :  Um , yeah .
C :  Just escape I think .
D :  The PowerPoint ?
A :  Yeah . Okay . Um , so back to decisions . Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ? Okay , so that's good .
B :  Kinetic yeah . Are we going to have a backup ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Or do we just
A :  But would a backup really be necessary ?
A :  I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's ,
B :  I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , and
A :  if there is backup .
B :  be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and well hope that it works . I think yeah . I think no . I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . Go for it .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . There's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ?
D :  So
A :  Yeah . It could even be one of our selling points .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It could be fully kinetic energy . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Environmentally conscious or something .
D :  So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? Okay .
B :  Is everyone happy with that ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hope so .
A :  Alright , the next um decision is chip on print . I don't exactly know what that means .
B :  Um , it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so
A :  Right , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ?
B :  Yeah , it was so that was without the L_C_D_ . So that means we're not doing the advanced . So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ?
C :  Yeah . I don yeah .
B :  Uh , so that's the simple .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ?
B :  Yeah possibly . So , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need . So it's a medium . So regular chip . Regular sorry .
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Okay . That's called medium , or regular ?
A :  'Kay .
B :  Regular chip .
D :  Oh , is regular not simple ?
C :  Yeah . It's for the lighting , yeah .
B :  Lighting . Yeah if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well .
D :  Right right right .
A :  Okay , and cases . Um , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ?
B :  So th
B :  I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber . Plastic with rubber
B :  Rubber . Yeah . Plastic rubber coat .
C :  Yeah plastic coat .
A :  coating and interchangeable
B :  Interchangeable , yeah . Still going for that . Yeah .
A :  yeah , interchangeable plates . Okay .
A :  User interface concept .
A :  This is your time to shine .
C :  We decided on the component . I , I I'm sorry , I've lost my um
C :  PowerPoint thing , so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component
B :  Your screen ?
D :  Think it was called command interface .
B :  Was it
A :  Oh , yeah . Yeah .
D :  Command interface , .
C :  The command inter
A :  Command interface .
B :  Ouch .
C :  The command line interface yeah .
A :  Did you say command line ? Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Line interface .
A :  Alright , and supplements .
A :  What's that all about ?
C :  Um ,
C :  I think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about
C :  what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use . Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? You know how um different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have .
A :  Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  We haven't really decided what to do about that .
A :  Um , what are our choices here ?
C :  Well it's just um
C :  w where where shall we locate the buttons . What kind of functions wi shall we have ?
A :  You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ?
B :  The power .
B :  Volume .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um
C :  So pretty just just the basic button functions .
A :  Yeah . Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have
B :  May yeah . Tone , contrast , and things . That's a bit
A :  Um , yeah .
D :  That was on , um
D :  one of my presentations . About how often it was used . Do you remember that ?
B :  Yeah , it was minima well , it wasn't the l
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it was hardly ever used really .
D :  I w
D :  Should I bring it up ?
A :  Yeah . And most televisions will come with a remote .
B :  Yeah . That would be good . Yeah , and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , so
C :  Yeah , each television .
A :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay , well we know we want numbers .
D :  The ch t
D :  Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . So tw twice every once every two hours .
D :  Um , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . That's brightness , colour , tone , all that .
B :  Mm . I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself , doesn't it ? I'm sure it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote .
C :  You don't change that often , yeah .
A :  Yeah , it does .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , and different televisions . Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . So we're just going for power , channels , volume ,
A :  changes like that .
A :  Volume .
D :  The other one was audio settings . Mono , stereo , pitch . I mean I sometimes use that . Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . Like almost once an hour . Um , relevance of two .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Oh . We have five minutes to finish our meeting .
A :  Crap . Okay , um , let's do this fast . Um
D :  Well that didn't some up on mine .
A :  Should we have audio ?
A :  It only comes up on mine usually .
C :  It w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else , just have an audio button though .
D :  Oh .
C :  Do you know ?
A :  Yeah , I don't , I it's , it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . But we know that everyone has this and it's the same .
C :  But we
D :  Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing , 'cause it , mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . This one has channel , volume and your channe and your power .
B :  I've
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's it . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . Yeah uh I brilliant .
C :  That could be a sales pitch .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Simple and
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Alright .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Good . And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . Um ,
A :  you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design .
A :  Wait a minute . Is that right ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . And you'll be evaluating the product .
A :  Um ,
A :  Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay .
A :  And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen .
B :  Okay . Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that . Um , so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development . But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ?
A :  Alright . So , anyone else have something to say ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas ? Like f five different
B :  Y Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  five . .
C :  What I
C :  What I was thinking what do yous think of this ? Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Like grapes . Like that's kind of fruity or something . That's just
D :  Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  We can have a look at those ideas , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well . So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . Something that your granny would want on her remote control . Um , and international tastes as well , so
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Not easy .
B :  Tricky . A lot of things to consider . Hm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Lots of yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright .
B :  Okay .
A :  'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then . Alright . And , um , we'll reconvene in thirty minutes . 'Kay . Bye . I'll see you later . Oh , what did I just do . Okay .
B :  Okay . Thank you .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Here we go .
A :  Alright , the agenda for thi oh .
A :  Alright . Um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave
A :  gave it . And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . And um evaluate the product , as a group . And um
B :  Okay .
A :  So first we'll have the prototype presentation . Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ?
B :  Um yeah . I just got a few slides , so show them .
A :  Alright .
B :  Thank you .
C :  Um
B :  Do you want to present it ?
C :  This is what we came up with . It's a pretty simple design . It's um based on a mango ? Yeah . And we
B :  Yeah , here we are .
A :  On ? A mango . Okay .
B :  Mango shape .
C :  Yeah . And we have the company logo here and this will be the
C :  infrared here and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind yeah .
B :  The L_E_D_ .
A :  Oh . Okay .
D :  I'm sorry . What was the where's the L_E_D_ ?
A :  Oops .
C :  It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . And then the other one is the power . And uh we just have a simple design . We wanted it all to be
D :  Oh . Okay .
B :  So it's palm-held .
C :  accessible from your thumb yeah palm-held and all the
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  buttons are accessible from your thumb .
A :  Notice you have a number ten button .
C :  So you don't have to
C :  Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ? Right no , that's a zero . Take that one off .
A :  Okay .
B :  You just need the nought .
C :  Sorry . I was in charge of the numbers .
A :  No problem . Ah .
C :  And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or
C :  thirt the plus . You can go one , three or something . You press that first and then you go one three yeah .
B :  So one plus one would be eleven , or
A :  Oh . You press a plus button ?
A :  Oh okay . I've never heard of that kind before .
C :  Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and
B :  Yeah because if you on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Oh , there's no e okay .
C :  So the plus and then yeah .
A :  Oh .
D :  Okay .
A :  But
A :  Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ?
C :  No no , th all that's why we have all these numbers . These numbers um
C :  these numbers all work independently up to nine .
A :  Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Oh no . Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine .
A :  Yeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ?
D :  Sixty .
C :  You p
C :  Oh .
C :  No you press the plus first . I I well it doesn't we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler ? It's a
B :  Oh .
B :  Well I don't mind , we can further define that .
A :  I th
A :  Um
B :  I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . But I was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But I suppose it's not as snappy .
D :  Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think . Where you can have it it's like a five second input time . So as long as you hit them dada
C :  Oops .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah . If you don't put it
B :  Yeah . Yeah , that yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  it should be fine . As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . So
B :  Um
D :  Was there so on the top there is volume and
B :  And channel , which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like
C :  A channel .
D :  Channel up volume up . Okay cool .
A :  C_ and V_ .
C :  Just so we can flick
A :  Right , where um where's the power button ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  It's in the middle of one of the little R_s .
D :  It's the R_ .
B :  It's the bigger R_ .
A :  Oh okay .
B :  So it's just like . We deci
C :  Yeah , so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . Uh e ergonomics are all considered . Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Oh okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic .
C :  And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . Okay .
B :  It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . But yeah , no I mean it's a different movement so yeah . Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , and it just feels feels different . Would you like to feel it yourselves ? How it fits in the palm of your hand ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  The spon yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Bit of a stress ball feel .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yes . I would .
A :  My goodness . There you go . Genevieve ? Yeah .
B :  Thanks . And you ?
D :  Yes . Oh it's nice . Oh I think I killed the five . I did . I killed the four . Oh god .
A :  And something hmm .
B :  Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . Or the combination .
D :  Oh it smells good .
C :  Of Play Doh yeah .
B :  Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish .
A :  Oh right .
C :  'Cause it'd be quite subtle and
A :  Yeah . It looks more
A :  Think like vanilla and banana would .
B :  Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay yeah .
B :  So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the yeah , seasonal .
A :  Kinda Christmas , you know .
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
B :  Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki
A :  Yeah .
C :  The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor .
A :  Cool .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it .
A :  Alright , thank you very much . Good work everyone .
D :  Bravo
A :  Alright . And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . So , I have
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  something I'm going to
D :  You want the
A :  Oh wait a minute . Do you need to do a presentation first ?
D :  I don't know what order it goes in . I have one .
A :  Yeah . I'm gonna check that out for a second .
B :  Mm go
A :  What time is it anyw
A :  Oh yeah sorry you're right . Evaluation criteria is next in line . Yeah .
D :  Evaluation cri Okay . That's me .
D :  Hello .
D :  Oh there we go .
D :  Okay . Come on my computer . Come on .
D :  Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties . Should I press it again ?
A :  Just press um function eight again .
D :  Last time I did that it sh
D :  Okay . You're right .
A :  And then again I think .
A :  One more time .
D :  Oh . Still not there .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay now I think for this one I could Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen .
D :  Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do .
D :  Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . So basically the lower p the lower the points the better .
D :  Okay so question number one . Does the remote whoops . Sorry . Oh I'm not gonna be able um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once .
A :  Okay .
D :  I'll write down our scores up on the
A :  Ooh .
D :  Okay so number one . Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ?
C :  Mm .
B :  Feel I think . We've been quite successful with the rubber coating and
A :  Yeah .
A :  The look is a little bit more playful .
C :  Well
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . It's not your traditional yeah .
A :  Oh definitely different yeah .
B :  I think the colour has a lot to do with it . I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . It's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek red , black and yellow , and orange . Um
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Oh you were only given red and black ?
A :  Oh okay .
C :  Yeah so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . A metallic-y finish we were thinking .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well I know know it's for rubber . I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Polished . Okay
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . I kinda I like the potato look . It's very different . It's what ? Oh sorry the mango the mango look . Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg .
C :  We we were we were thinking about yeah .
A :  It's mango . It's mango .
B :  Potato's fine . Potato's fine .
B :  Yeah . Totally . It's really adaptable .
D :  So I myself would say a one or a two .
A :  Yeah . I would say two . Personally .
D :  It's a two ?
C :  I w I'd say two I think .
D :  Okay , and p
B :  For the
C :  Fanciness .
B :  fancy
A :  Yeah .
D :  One being true . So
B :  I uh two , three .
D :  Two . Okay , actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah and the use of the rubber .
D :  Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ .
C :  Yeah .
B :  For the anti-R_S_I_ .
A :  Yeah .
B :  The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . In some aspects it is , like we said .
D :  Isn't
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I'd say maybe three .
C :  I'll go for three as well .
D :  Yeah . And I think I mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . So I mean I we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal .
B :  Yeah . Though it was our specification .
C :  No . Wouldn't be simple , yeah .
A :  Yeah we want it simple .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  We didn't want it any more than that . Okay question number three . Uh , will it be easy to use ?
A :  I think so . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah very . I think one for that . Yeah . No .
D :  Yeah . Yeah . S
D :  Yeah I think it's you can't really get confused with that . I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system . But once that's figured out , it should be fine .
A :  Yeah . One .
B :  Yeah .
A :  The plus number thing .
C :  Yeah that's the only thing yeah .
B :  Yeah and perhaps the turning on but
D :  Number four . Is this a good-looking remote ? Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
B :  Mm .
C :  It's definitely
B :  Again I think the colour comes into this .
A :  Yeah colour will definitely be a factor .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think that the logo could be smaller .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And maybe not such a prominent way . Maybe like at the bottom , kind of .
C :  But the
C :  Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent .
B :  Not in
D :  Whoops .
A :  Oh it just had to be on there I guess .
D :  Should just not touch it . This time it's the three I killed . I was just wondering if it should be like flatter .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Don't worry .
D :  Or
B :  I suppose I've got quite big hands .
A :  I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand .
D :  Well
C :  Yeah . But you know what I've just thought of there now . What where's it gonna sit in your living room ? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ?
A :  Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like
D :  Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit .
C :  Yeah . But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand .
A :  round .
D :  Oh . That's true .
A :  It would still be comfortable I think . We c we could handle it I think .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly .
D :  Maybe , it could it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . Like that .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh that would be nice .
A :  Ah it'd fall over all the time though . It'd be annoying .
B :  Uh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I g
D :  If it's weighted maybe . Details , details . Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? Would we wanna show it off to our friends ?
B :  H it's got higher centre of gravity like that .
A :  'Kay we're done designing . Come on .
C :  Three . You would though , 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think , it was another colour and it was like I think it'd look okay . I think maybe a two .
D :  Yeah ?
D :  I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , but
B :  I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , so should we say two for that ? Yeah ?
A :  Sure .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . Uh , question number five . What's um will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy .
C :  I think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic . So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . We have to market it .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it .
B :  Yeah . And the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , ooh no .
C :  And the kinetic energy part . Yeah . Don't shake
A :  Yeah .
D :  Shake it and the buttons fall off .
A :  Durable .
B :  But you know , those'll be firmly on .
C :  Oh no the plus . You're use the zero . Make a new one .
D :  No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , but I know I am , aren't I ?
A :  But you're our Marketing Expert .
C :  I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? About ten pounds . Fifteen ?
D :  But you don't have to buy batteries . So in the long term this can actually save you money . So we'll market it that way too .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm , yeah , that's true .
A :  Oh . Exactly . Exactly .
B :  Yeah . Good point .
D :  So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll
A :  Yeah . I would give it a two still though .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Okay number six . Can someone read it out ? Or
C :  Mm .
B :  Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um yeah . So that was mainly that the statistics we said
B :  Yeah .
C :  I think it does very well .
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  Because yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . And it's just you won't have to think about it . You don't have to look down to find them . They're clearly there , easy to use . Simple .
C :  The zap yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah I guess the I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . But they're not you and I really . So . Okay so one ? Okay . Number seven . C Heather could you push it down ? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . Now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ?
C :  Uh
B :  Yeah . Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  We have the alarm system .
C :  Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra
B :  It
B :  Yeah l lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm .
C :  It'll be again in the marketing .
A :  I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up .
C :  Yeah . The light it will .
A :  Or or was it gonna make a noise ?
B :  Yeah . But when the alarm's not yeah . If you
C :  But
C :  But both
A :  You press the button it makes a noise right ?
D :  It turns into a duck and starts quacking . Here I am . Um
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  You could s Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Awesome . Awesome .
C :  Oh , that would be brilliant . I'd be tempted to
B :  Well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up .
C :  Yeah .
C :  It would have to be in the market
A :  I though w it was gonna make a noise .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . Alarm , but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself .
C :  Yeah but you still couldn't see it .
C :  It would just be a little speaker on the back or something .
A :  Okay .
D :  We oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . But yeah , it'll be there . So we can we could say that
B :  Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah . Sorry .
A :  Oh okay . Whoo . Okay .
D :  We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . Okay . Um
A :  Yeah , totally .
B :  Yeah . Sorry Heather . That wasn't very clear .
A :  No problem , mm .
D :  Question number eight . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . So it has to be yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . The plus thing needs to be worked on .
A :  Totally .
C :  So the plu the plus w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , won't it ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah I think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well
C :  Yeah .
D :  Do
D :  Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least .
A :  Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter .
C :  That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press I don't know why .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah but you don't have to press zeros .
D :  You could just press six enter , or one two enter . Yeah .
C :  Oh okay . Right .
A :  And then like twelve , enter .
B :  And or sixty six enter , y
C :  Alright , aye .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . Yeah . Good
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um , okay so we can we'll say yes it's uh one ? Okay .
C :  I'd say w yeah one . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Ooh . Mm .
D :  Question number nine . Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? Um , which affected over a quarter of users .
B :  Oh .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Injury .
C :  Hmm .
A :  I think so . It's like right in the
C :  But if you're zapping yeah . I don't think it will f
A :  Your thumb might get a little bit uh
B :  Yeah , that's what I was thinking . We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about .
C :  Yeah , the biology .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But it is soft .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  It's soft , and
A :  And that's kind of what the um
C :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ , so maybe it is but
D :  And people could
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I don't know what other options there are .
B :  I think we're getting that's true .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Could I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So , one or two do you think ?
C :  I I'd say t two . Yeah .
B :  I think yeah , I think too .
D :  Two okay . Okay number ten . Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? Is the yellow
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yes we did .
C :  Yeah .
C :  N We we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . It won't stand out . So n it's not always gonna be the same colour .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  It sounds like the colour's something that we
A :  Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . So it could be grey on the banana one .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Gray , yeah .
C :  Yeah , could be grey .
A :  Yeah .
D :  But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , depending on the
C :  Yeah that's right , we didn't even rea
D :  So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah . I think this is the
C :  Yeah .
B :  the factor that we've been least successful in confronting .
D :  Okay .
C :  Perhaps a metallic or or like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . No ?
A :  Mm , yeah .
D :  Yeah . And the buttons in the middle .
C :  That isn't rubber .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . So , do you think that's more of a three then ? Three , four ?
B :  Four I think . Well I don't what do what
D :  Four ?
D :  Well we have good reasons for it , so we but we can still put a
A :  Hum .
D :  a four ?
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay , and final question . Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess .
A :  I would say so .
C :  Following that briefing we did .
A :  But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Like um the colour scheme names and stuff .
D :  Yeah .
A :  With the with the colours .
C :  Yeah .
D :  No , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? I think I missed a few they are ? So you can have banana and kiwi and okay . Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It is .
C :  I think w yeah , I think one . Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . Well we haven't got a big banana but
B :  The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango .
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  Be like
C :  No .
C :  No .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe if it was scented . Yeah we have money for that . Um
C :  Oh that would be class .
B :  Oh yeah . There we go . That would be great .
B :  Um
A :  Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ?
D :  Yes we do . So I wh what was I gonna put for that ? A two for fashion ?
A :  Oh .
A :  I would say two .
C :  Yeah . Two .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven
C :  It's
D :  is
A :  One point nine or something ? I don't know these things . Um , between one and two .
B :  It's
C :  Yeah .
B :  Between one and two .
D :  Between okay . Um .
B :  So that's pretty fantastic .
C :  Close to two . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one .
A :  Alright .
C :  I got
D :  Does that seem right then ?
C :  Yeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
C :  Uh , aye .
B :  It seems like it should be more around two .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Uh , should've added five .
B :  Do we have an online calculator ?
A :  I'm attempting to do that right now .
C :  This is .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah it is one point nine . Ooh .
B :  Oh wow . Well done . Well that's excellent .
C :  Yay .
A :  Go Heather Pauls .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . And um my computer's frozen .
A :  And now it's not . Okay . So
A :  um in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , um
D :  Sorry . Are you gonna do that ? Okay .

B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh right .
A :  Um we're using a regular chip .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . That's another three . We're already at five . Um , we're using plastic and rubber , so

B :  I think we were pushed .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Pushed for creativity ?
B :  I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . So I think we could've done with a bit more time .
C :  The ma
C :  Or materials .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Ye Okay . So it'd be like
A :  need more time and
A :  materials . But you were allowed m creativity ? I think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah and the conceptual and functional . Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . So that did limit

D :  Um
C :  Yeah . Through discussion .
D :  I'm not sure , new ideas found .
