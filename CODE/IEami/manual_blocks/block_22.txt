D :  Is this okay ?
A :  Uh yeah . Fine now .
A :  Oh , it's not liking us , it went that-a-way .
A :  Computer adjusting . Oh .
A :  Uh .
A :  Okay . So .
A :  Right .
A :  You ready back there ?
A :  Uh okay .
A :  Welcome everyone . Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day . Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction .
A :  As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , um become acquainted with each other , um have a little training on tools , uh create a plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total .
A :  Okay . The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . The originality um is gonna take all of us . Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , Sarah . Um and we'll get on with it . Okay , so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design .
A :  Okay ? Right . Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess
B :  Uh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on .
A :  And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around .
B :  Uh right , so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? Um
A :  Uh I do not think so , I think it's just to try out the whiteboard .
C :  Are we all gonna draw a cat ?
D :  I know .
B :  Only animal I could thin I could draw .
A :  Ah .
B :  Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears . Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay .
B :  Right , yeah .
A :  Great . And the characteristics ?
B :  Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers I think , um because they're the easiest to draw . In fact , I'll give it some more
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  Oh , and the tail
A :  Okay .
A :  Fantastic . Since you're handy as well , why don't you do yours next , Steph .
A :  I think it's to get us used to using the pen .
B :  Yes . Um sure it's not to test our artistic
A :  Uh no .
B :  It's a mouse .
A :  A mouse-y ?
C :  That's not a mouse-y , no .
B :  No it's not a mouse .
B :  It's a wombat .
A :  Oh .
C :  It's a ratty .
A :  Argh . Rat .
B :  A what ?
C :  A ratty .
A :  Not a mouse , a rat .
B :  A webbed foot . Webbed f Oh right .
C :  It's clothes . That's it's clothes .
C :  It's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail .
A :  And your favourite characteristics of that animal .
C :  I love whiskers .
C :  Uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky and
C :  uh fantastic pets and very friendly . And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework .
A :  Oh . Okay . Kate ?
D :  Thanks .
A :  Oh , a fish .
B :  Gosh , why didn't I think of fish ? That's even easier to draw than cat .
C :  A shark ?
D :  Mm this is very representational fish . Um I like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups , so .
A :  Oh , okay . Fine .
A :  Favourite characteristics ?
A :  'Kay .
A :  So they have team elements .
D :  Do you have a favourite one ?
A :  I'm afraid I'm with Steph .
A :  And I think your pen's running out of whatever .
A :  But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out , and the cat's looking the other way . He's hiding .
A :  Um cats are sometimes very independent . My parents had cats . Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best .
A :  Okay .
A :  Now um we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . Um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item .
A :  Now if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , that's t uh can you do the maths and how many are we selling ?
D :  Uh yeah . I was just wondering if that's the um
D :  If fifty percent is normal
A :  Mark-up ?
D :  B yeah . Um I would think would be more like sixty percent .
D :  But um let me I have two thoughts . One hundred , fifty percent .
A :  Okay .
D :  And and your question is how many do we have to sell ?
A :  Yes , 'cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know , you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that .
D :  At twenty five .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , that's um
A :  To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking .
D :  So that's four million of them ?
A :  Something like that ?
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That's fifty million Euros . In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each
D :  And if we make
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  That's a lot of selling .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Two four
D :  Four million .
A :  To be fifty , be four million . You'd have to sell four million .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Okay ?
A :  Right .
A :  Experience with a remote control . Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? You're both nodding , all three .
B :  That that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a in a home environment , for a T_V_s and
D :  Yeah .
A :  I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another .
C :  It is true that you always sit around you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Y yeah .
A :  And they don't always talk to each other .
A :  Don't know .
A :  Okay . Are there any um ideas for the remote ? What would it be for and what group would be be for ?
A :  We have to think about that one .
D :  We could make a Hello Kitty
D :  themed remote .
C :  I think one in b bright colours would be good .
D :  Yeah . We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . Well I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products . Electrical their industrial design is very good .
B :  I think one that works would be good .
C :  I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . Like I've got one at home that has
C :  well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume ,
D :  Yeah .
C :  you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like .
D :  Well , that's a really good point , because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , you know , so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down .
A :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod , you know , make everything menus .
C :  Ooh , closing the meeting .
A :  Yeah . Um I know this sounds like it was very quick , but the
C :  That was quick .
A :  I think that's the industrial design is the first one , that's Kate , for the working design . And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification . I think there's going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group , and I think we all , you know , we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done . Uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time , so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . Do you all agree ?
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright . Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things . Alright , so this is the end of the first meeting . Thank you all .
D :  Okay .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Uh it fell off .
A :  One , two , three , four , yeah , we're ready .
A :  Okay . Welcome to this second meeting . Um it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting . This is a meeting on functional design . Um and I wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between .
A :  Um I did took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment . Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . Okay ?
A :  Is this ap everybody agree with this ?
B :  Oops .
C :  Yes .
D :  Yes .
A :  Okay . Um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . Um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting .
A :  And go to that one . Um as you can see it was this earlier today . Um Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . I opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting
A :  Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ?
A :  'Kay .
B :  Uh I think so , we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well .
A :  Did I miss something ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present , but yes , we did , and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures , but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . So um as a group I think we've are they're accepting the minutes .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay , I accept the minutes .
A :  And uh okay .
D :  Is that what we're supposed to say ?
A :  Yeah . Good . Um , then we'll move to the three presentations .
C :  Yeah , I do .
A :  Okay ?
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm we need to move this . Who wants to go f first ?
A :  That's as far as it goes .
C :  Uh not really meant to touch those microphones . Oh it doesn't have any on , does it ? That's fine .
D :  Excellent , thank you .
B :  Oy , big loop under the table .
A :  She said we didn't need to screw it in .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay , that looks good .
A :  It's doing its thing . There we are .
D :  Alright . Thank you very much . Um .
D :  One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um
D :  remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar
D :  of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . So um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to
D :  make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback
D :  from our well designed tool . So again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . Um fifty percent I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy .
B :  Could can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've
D :  Um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money .
A :  Now in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be um that teletext is outdated um and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well I think we can I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't um advertise for the I go everywhere line . So an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . So these market research uh uh questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology and s specifically wanted to
A :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
D :  find out information about speech recognition .
A :  Okay .
D :  the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know , the the designers , but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five
A :  Mm .
A :  Is that a large enough target market to target it ?
D :  Well , I I I think especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target . I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh
A :  In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  To
D :  Um yes .
A :  Or eight million .
D :  Yes . But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an that's a that's a very good question . I don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included , but I think it's an interesting I think that maybe shows more about uh
A :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um
A :  Mm .
D :  being open to technology .
C :  Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples , and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing .
A :  Mm .
D :  Shall I go back ?
D :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty , um is that a lot or a little ?
D :  Exactly . I mean I I I uh did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but uh some of the larger
D :  remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray . You know , it's I a and I think , you know
B :  Sh surely he's in the wrong age group . He must be w one of a s small population .
D :  No , no , you Kate , you're exactly right there . But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and uh they'll be
A :  Mm .
A :  But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , that's looking at age groups .
D :  Uh , mm .
D :  Exactly . I yes , and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . Or comfortable , you know , um so
A :  Leap .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay , you had the other power channel .
D :  I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh
D :  up to the designers .
D :  And this is this is also supported by the market research .
A :  Okay .
D :  Thank you . That's my contribution .
A :  Alright . And we'll turn to the next presentation .
A :  I think she said we don't need to screw it in , just stick it in .
A :  And then press , what ? F F_N_ and F_ eight . Next to the control button on the bottom , and then F_ eight at the top .
C :  Yeah , press them .
A :  And then w be patient .
C :  Yeah , here we go .
A :  Tada .
B :  And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there .
C :  Can I not just uh
C :  do each one in order ?
B :  I you can if you like , it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p no that one , that one there .
C :  That ?
A :  There we are . Yay .
C :  That ?
B :  Left , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep . And then you just press the click when you wanna go on .
C :  That ?
C :  Right , technical functions design .
C :  Uh well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions .
C :  So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions
C :  uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss .
A :  Okay .
C :  Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_
A :  T_V_ only .
C :  remote control . So these are two models of existing remote controls .
C :  Uh the one on the left
A :  Ugh .
C :  seems to be a fairly
C :  uh standard universal remote control . It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . It also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all .
C :  I think we just need channel selection ,
C :  volume up , volume down and
C :  I think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . Uh
C :  not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do .
A :  Mm .
A :  And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us .
C :  So it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , which
C :  is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons o I was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access .
A :  Okay .
A :  Alright .
C :  Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech
C :  um recognition possibility .
A :  Okay . Any uh thing else you wanna add ? Okay .
C :  No .
C :  But we could go back to the pictures of the
C :  uh , what're they called ?
C :  The pictures of the remote controls
C :  and possibly discuss what we think about them , but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first .
D :  Or if
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Let's hear what Kate has to say .
D :  Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a
C :  Okay then .
D :  basis .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Whiteboard session .
A :  I think the white that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered ,
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Definitely less cluttered and I mean but still it's
C :  Sorry I was just I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say . The the style of these is terrible . I I I really think we need to uh
A :  It's there but it's
A :  Yeah .
C :  not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours ,
D :  The ergonomics , the way it fits in your
C :  just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But
C :  So that's that for now .
B :  Cheers .
B :  Mm , I haven't actually got a display on my screen . Still , I'll do without that . Okay um , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work .
A :  Okay .
B :  Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . Um basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you .
B :  So , let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and
B :  which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . Now I would have hoped I think that's my only slide actually , yeah . I would have have hoped to um
B :  do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard .
B :  So we want an energy source
B :  which is there .
B :  And we've got to think about what that might be . Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . Uh typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions . Um and
A :  Hmm-mm .
B :  then we have the the user interface .
B :  Oops .
B :  And the main components in there are the
B :  the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then
B :  transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it
B :  and sends the message to the receiver . So those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty . Thank you .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right . But those things as long as we can get those components ,
A :  the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ? Uh what does it feel like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? Um is there any um because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . Um does it have to have a
A :  a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ?
B :  Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . We're trying to sell four million of 'em , um that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing , you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  Do we have um
C :  Whoop .
A :  Okay .
D :  ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? Because then
C :  Isn't that your job ?
A :  Oh .
D :  No , the chip composer marketing . Oh no , the chip composer sender .
C :  Oh right .
A :  Mm . What they cost .
D :  I I don't believe I know , um .
B :  Um ,
B :  I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , but
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the which is pretty much the same as these existing models , just maybe
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Inspired ?
C :  a little bit more inspired ,
D :  Mm .
C :  but basically just the same . Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all .
C :  Could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . You could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , which are
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well that has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place .
A :  Mm .
C :  You'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah .
D :  Yeah , but it also has a place , so exactly .
C :  And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not .
A :  Mm .
D :  That's a really good idea .
B :  Well I uh think that's a very interesting idea , but um I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . I'll do some research for the next meeting .
D :  Well it's better than my idea about solar , probably . Yeah , yeah . Depen
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh yeah .
B :  Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , but
A :  Mm .
C :  Well it is just so annoying how
A :  It would have to sor store up the energy
D :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I guess .
A :  and then use it . Solar can do that .
B :  We may be talking quite heavy then .
A :  M yeah , that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer and
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ?
C :  you know f
D :  Definitely , 'cause I'm thinking in terms of um uh
A :  Mm .
D :  the
D :  loss and breakage of um remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home , a um a nest , a place to live , exactly . So if you can dock it , um you know , you could s argue that this is
C :  Mm . Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent .
D :  Exactly .
C :  Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range .
D :  Mm . 'Cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ?
D :  Mm .
A :  Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end .
D :  Well I I brought up some exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? You know , these are the
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , I was wondering that , because I ag I agree that there there're people with uh how can I put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new , but
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , exactly .
A :  I I s usually put more money than brains .
B :  Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that , are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , I don't know .
D :  Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . Good , good comment .
D :  Yeah .
D :  It might be good to know um uh who , you know , who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh s
C :  Yeah .
D :  region where people have more than one television in a home ?
B :  Mm . I think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ? I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it .
B :  Right , good point . Yeah , yeah okay , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , good point .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That's probably more what it is .
A :  What would be a more efficient way of doing it ?
D :  Yeah , and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  to go for the the manufacturers .
A :  Okay . Right .
C :  We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , are we ?
A :  Probably not . Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current
D :  Mm .
A :  styles are just plain awful .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Do we need um let me
A :  Is that agreeable to everyone ?
D :  Br actually , um
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  the enter key I have a chart here that I didn't include . Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Do you want the gizmo ?
D :  yeah , which might
A :  Throw some light on that .
D :  Th yeah , th those are
D :  felt like had a lot of charts .
A :  Um actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing .
D :  Okay , I I my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining .
A :  Ah . Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
D :  Um
A :  Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key .
D :  Exactly . Again , you know , thinking of menus or
A :  Is that okay with you ?
C :  Sorry , I was miles away . I was re I was reading the chart to be honest .
B :  H how does that work ? How so so how does that work , how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ?
A :  Would that uh-huh .
D :  well if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter um so you press power after you've um well I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice .
A :  Then you'd have to have an off te off key .
B :  Okay , yep , mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  It's not getting a bit complicated ?
B :  Could granny do this , or are we just not aiming at granny ?
D :  Well
D :  Or y yeah . Or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . Yeah , I don't um I wish . Anyway , uh that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions
C :  Who's got an iPod then ?
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  people have made , what's most important . It's definitely channel , volume , power .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally
C :  do them on the actual television itself , like here you have a
D :  Exactly .
C :  you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control , so
D :  Exactly .
D :  Yeah .
C :  um I would say that they are definitely less relevant .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay , well . Thanks for looking at that .
A :  So I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . I just joined that set last week . Um first grandchild arrived . Um so are we agreed then of those things ? And let's go back to agenda and hook me up .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  We don't wanna outsmart
D :  Hmm .
D :  Congratulations .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh .
A :  Mm . This oughta be fun . It probably won't go the first time , it'll probably be like a g mess .
A :  Come on .
A :  Uh it lost it off here . Uh
D :  Oh you're fine .
D :  It's fine .
A :  No , it was up there , but I couldn't see it down here .
A :  Mm .
A :  This time it should be both .
A :  There we go .
B :  How do you do that ? How do you make it do both ?
A :  Um you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to five minutes to finish , thank you a lot for telling me . Um right , we're ready to close . Um will be completed q questionnaire , um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together . Um your individual assignments are for
B :  Ah okay , it toggles through , yeah .
D :  I think you have to cycle through .
B :  Yeah .
A :  um Kate to do the components , for
A :  you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching . Um and each of us will get help from our coach . Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch ? Okay . Then that's the end of this meeting . And I hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end . Okay ?
C :  Yes .
B :  Sounds good .
B :  Okay .
C :  We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though .
A :  Well I think I went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them . Um that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them .
C :  Alright , well that's fine then .
D :  Okay .
D :  Um and you'd mentioned I I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , because it they were it has to be for a T_V_ , just to keep myself
A :  Okay .
A :  Um the teletext is outdated , the internet is important , it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan um which I think is more in the user uh range , with Steph .
B :  So we're still in meeting , aren't we ?
D :  Yeah , I think I've
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
C :  Sorry , what what actually are these is that the yellow and black ?
A :  It doesn't tell me .
D :  Mm .
C :  From their I'll just use it from their website .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay ?
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Right . Thank you .
A :  Hi Kate . Okay , carry on . Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , I have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . Um and we should each have a presentation to make . Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . It's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . Okay .
B :  Just just carry on .
A :  Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the
A :  minutes of the previous meeting .
A :  Right um as we remember , I opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved . Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition .
A :  And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . I think all of us agreed with those things . Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . Um and the new requirements that it for be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . Um
A :  the corporate image .
A :  So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , but it still should meet those parameters . Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held .
A :  Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report .
A :  Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right . So we're ready to close that and go back to our
A :  That one .
A :  Right . We're up to the point of the
A :  Go back .
A :  Um the three presentations . So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah . Is that okay ?
A :  Is that alright with everybody else ? Especially since Kate asked to be last . Sarah , I'm sorry if I misspelled your name , I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or S_A_R_H_ .
C :  Yep .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I respond to either . No worries .
A :  You respond to whatever you get , huh ? Okay .
A :  Um , did you do your Hit
C :  Yeah ,
A :  Ah , there it is .
D :  Okay , first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up , which was uh current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding . Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market . But I'm going to move on to more interesting um more vibrant things .
A :  Ta-da .
C :  Right .
A :  Mm 'kay .
D :  So , I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my uh the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch .
D :  And
A :  'Kay .
B :  Sorry . I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on .
D :  I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research , so you know , I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . What's hot , fruit and veg .
D :  Spongy . And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . This is really interesting change from past years , because it is much more organic , um some would say approachable . And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics
A :  Mm .
D :  and some of the bold colours into a simple
D :  handset . So . I also did a little research on um
D :  what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . Fancy . Functional is out . And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . This is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . This is interesting , 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . Ease of use . Again , pretty low , I mean it's the top three , but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . So
D :  I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves .
B :  I think that's a good idea . Don't you ?
D :  Y yeah , you know
C :  Yes .
A :  It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone .
D :  Exactly .
D :  Exactly . I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . They could be ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . Um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it . They could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . So what we're talking about is changing .
A :  Mm .
D :  this concept . Everyone has a T_V_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . That's what's hot on the catwalks . So , this is my
D :  This is what I'm thinking .
A :  Hmm .
C : 
A :  Uh-huh mm .
A :  In most families , don't isn't the remote is a remote .
D :  Y yeah , but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .
A :  Mm .
C :  So when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this .
D :  Yeah . W and plus I think
A :  Mm . Well actually some households do have three and four T_V_s and they would have a remote for each one , so .
D :  Uh yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . So this is an idea and I I you know , this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This spongy fruit and veg .
B :  Yeah , I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid .
D :  Thanks .
D :  Alright .
C :  Yep .
A :  Hmm .
C :  And as for
A :  Hmm .
C :  as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable
D :  I I just have my ear to the market , guys .
C :  components . Is this to the market ?
B :  Yeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , yeah .
D :  Is spongiest , yeah . That would add
B :  I was thinking titanium myself .
C :  I was thinking titanium , I was thinking it's just I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , and they're also minimalist and shiny .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  They are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . I think many of us would associate those with fancy . Something else we could do is uh
D :  call it something that's fruit and veg
D :  oriented . We could call it uh
D :  The name .
A :  Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate
A :  product ?
D :  Well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So
A :  Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product .
C :  Yeah , but it's kind of pointless , isn't it ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  That , you know , that might be
C :  Let's delegate .
A :  Wo would that be agreeable ?
D :  And then we could keep it titanium .
B :  Yeah . W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit , because I think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do .
C :  Yeah , maybe . Or
A :  Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ?
C :  I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next .
A :  Okay , we'll move the
C :  Um
C :  You can even have them in different flavours as well . So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , yeah . Scratch and sniff .
D :  Yeah . Or s or smelly . Scratchy
D :  Uh well I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone . It's hot on the streets , guys .
B :  Right , well I I I think some of this um you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , but I'm afraid this is the real world . So um
B :  I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want um . Now this isn't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control um . I really need a pen or something but uh does my mouse work ? No . Um oh yeah , can you see my little mouse pointer ? Right . This is this is the a a a remote that's been opened up and that's the the back of the interface .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
B :  And this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . Um and we that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver .
B :  So um I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made , Sarah , but um doing my presentation in the order I wrote it . So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment .
B :  We can have a hand sorry a wind-up , yeah , which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device , which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . You have to it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work , but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , it'll work . Or we we had talked about solar power , but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark .
C :  A wind-up .
D : 
A :  Alright .
A :  Remember , we only have forty minutes
D :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium . Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , but um
D :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm .
B :  I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Okay , what does the interface look like ? Um well push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to
A :  Hmm .
B :  select something . Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it's it the technology is there . And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I'm afraid . Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display .
B :  And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . Now I don't know what that is , but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that's old technology . And well I I think we've got two options . We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um
D :  Mm .
B :  that may or may not be a good thing . Sorry . Um but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . So , thank you .
D :  That sounds good . Any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . Um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ?
B :  Yeah , I'm afraid I don't have that information available . Um
B :  manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm . Because , you know what , I'm being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot . But I think the important thing might be to choose one . You know , if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , Blackberry .
B :  Yeah mm-hmm .
D :  That's uh
C :  Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it .
B :  Banana ?
D :  Alright , well let's see then .
C :  But um
C :  I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing . That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But yeah , I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit .
B :  We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , which would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , we can't do anything fancier .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Shall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what well , my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
D :  Mm .
D :  Thank you , Kate .
A :  Thank you , Kate .
D :  Mm .
C :  You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . So so mine's a bit pointless .
C :  Right .
C :  F_N_ and F_ eight , did you say ?
A :  Yes .
A :  There we go .
C :  I don't have it on mine though .
D :  Oh I think um
D :  Florence resolved it by
B :  I If you do F_ uh F_N_ F_ eight again , it's it'll
A :  Do it again .
D :  F_ eight again .
A :  Keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there , you get it yours without that one , and then you get it with both .
B :  I think it yeah , you you will do an
C :  Should I do it again ?
D :  Maybe .
A :  Yeah .
A :  This time it should come up both .
C :  Right then . I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , just
A :  Okay .
C :  that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones ,
A :  Mm .
C :  um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual
C :  the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , which
C :  Well , I couldn't find a the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , so I couldn't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . It has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse . So I was thinking that uh um a really simple
A :  Hmm .
B :  Hmm .
C :  a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen .
C :  Like I guess an existing
C :  Sky or cable one does . Like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching
C :  the same channel on the screen .
C :  Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote ,
D :  Mm .
C :  um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . So
C :  what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have
C :  a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . If we're k trying to keep it
B :  Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea .
C :  colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too
C :  futuristic .
B :  It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Uh then
B :  And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , 'cause um otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting building the L_C_D_ in , but for the electronics as well .
C :  And it's a little bit pointless as well I think . Like when when when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy , just a little menu showing yeah , a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the
D :  It's a duplication .
B :  There is that .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  you know , your information about programme that's on at the moment . I don't think that's to taxing to uh
C :  s engineer . Um .
C :  But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the
C :  to the picture of the kiddie one .
C :  And I quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out , so something a bit like that with
C :  buttons arranged in a
C :  kind of circle . Up , down , left , right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ?
C :  I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but you know , a I can't quite d uh describe it . you see
C :  on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . Yeah , see where the mouse is , like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right .
C :  And enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that . I'm getting a bit uh specific here . Really we'd have to use something to show you , but
B :  Yeah . I think I think that's a g nice clean design , it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology .
C :  If I don't think I can get it up on the screen . Ah here we go . Right .
D :  To uh m make it .
D :  Oh nice .
C :  Well , the iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated . It does scroll , but it is hugely complicated . What else have we got ?
D :  Um Hmm .
A :  Huh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  Wow .
C :  Them , they're terrible . But they all have this this feature of this uh
C :  It's not quite a scroll wheel , but
A :  It's a selection wheel .
C :  it's a kind of selection in this circle , which I think is a really good idea .
B :  But we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper .
C :  Yeah , like up , down , left and right .
C :  Which is good . And then and then
C :  Yeah , so I mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down ,
C :  next appearing programmes up and down , uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  And that's it .
B :  In fact
C :  Look at look at this one .
B :  Oh that's really nice .
C :  Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . Might take up your whole living room .
D :  Do you think with um
D :  It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child's remote . Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ?
D :  And have it abstract . You know , we could call like a fruit name , but it would be a little more abstract .
C :  Possibly . Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy
C :  That also is possible .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Just
D :  I'm just just throwing out ideas .
A :  Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah . I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the
D :  design constraints are so
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? This is actually the volume up and down , but they both say V_ on them , which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , but it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume , so
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Nice . Good point .
C :  But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions .
A :  Mm 'kay .
C :  But then , that's complicated .
A :  I wanna thank you all for all your presentations . We have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . So let's
A :  Mm .
A :  Right .
A :  They want us to decide
A :  what form of energy are we going to use ,
A :  which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar .
A :  Um this is where Kate's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point . The
A :  You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um
A :  or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ . Um so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ?
B :  Mm .
B :  Oh unfortunately I don't have costing information . I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , but I'm sorry I don't figures on the difference in cost .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ?
D :  I've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy , you don't even notice
D :  um that it's there .
C :  It sounds great . I've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . Sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient .
D :  It's
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  It could tie in with the fanciful design as uh , you know , throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah . 'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought , isn't it ? It's like yeah , a good selling point .
A :  So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible .
C :  But it does depend how much
A :  It costs .
C :  I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  And and how much you do have to keep it moving , 'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm . But I could market that as a um as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know .
A :  Mm .
C :  Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ .
B :  Yeah .
B :  True , yeah , m more more environmentally friendly .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah , that's what I was thinking as well .
D :  Mm-hmm . You know , kind of the
A :  Yeah .
A :  Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . Um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision .
B :  Oh right , okay , I'd that that's something I maybe should have covered . Um
B :  chip on print is just a manufacturing technique um and I would certainly recommend it , I think , because I'm not sure I have an alternative .
A :  Oh .
A :  Okay .
B :  I i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper .
A :  What about the ca yeah . Oh , the way we uh-huh .
A :  Oh , okay .
A :  Um what about the case ?
A :  I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , and I think we've discussed not having titanium . One , it's too expensive , um and second , it won't do this double um curves . Um we've sort of eliminated wood . We said plastic or rubber . What's the pleasure ?
B :  Well if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , so it's yeah .
D :  That's exactly what I was thinking . I'm sold .
A :  What about you ?
C :  Do you not think it might need
C :  like a kind of
C :  a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy
D :  Mm .
D :  Kind of like an internal egg .
A :  Cover . Uh-huh .
C :  Yeah , s thick spongy cover , so it feels like the whole thing's spongy , but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it .
A :  Plastic inside .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac
B :  Yeah . I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but I agree , it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is .
C :  Yeah . Well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them , and
A :  Hmm .
D :  And with sports on television .
A :  Okay .
D :  You know . I su
A :  Um the next part they want is the user interface concept . I'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to finish with .
B :  I should I should r
D :  Then I'll just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that .
A :  Okay , and it says interface . What type and what supplements ?
C :  Just copy the one on the left . No um a scroll
C :  Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen .
B :  Which I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on .
C :  Yeah , I'd like push buttons with
C :  So push buttons
A :  Okay , um
A :  that's that .
A :  Um this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Whew . And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . Marketing they want product evaluation . Oh . Oh my , I'm sorry .
C :  No , it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually .
D :  No we can't , actually .
D :  That's why I was looking over your shoulder
A :  Oh , okay . Sorry about that . missed that one .
A :  This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . Ah , ta-da .
C :  Now it's gone again .
A :  Ah .
B :  You know , I think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately .
A :  Yes , because I can't even see mine . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes , these are the individual actions . Yeah , right . Um the look and feel design is for Kate , uh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product evaluation . Um the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . Anything else we need to do ?
C :  Oh yes .
D :  Mm .
C :  Great .
D :  Sounds good .
C :  I don't think so .
A :  Go to it .
C :  Play-Doh .
A :  And that's the end of this meeting .
A :  That's for her benefit .
D :  That's really all I got , guys .
A :  Um almost , there's one more thing I have to get out of the I have to make sure that this attachment will open .
B :  I keep forgetting whether I've done this . .
A :  Ah-ha .
A :  Okay .
A :  We'll open that when the time is right .
A :  In the meantime
A :  Closing things down , okay .
A :  Let's see what this thing does .
A :  Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? Ah , we came up together , we're good .
A :  Okay .
A :  Are we ready to start ?
A :  Okay . It's now quarter of four . This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right . Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . So we're going to make a very fast track . Okay .
A :  Um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to
A :  Where is it ?
D :  Red .
A :  I need to open mine .
A :  Not the agenda .
D :  Agenda three .
A :  No that th I want the minutes from the previous minutes . That should be there , minutes . Yeah . Okay . Uh from meeting three , is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 'Cause this way I can more easily flip it . Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations .
D :  Mm .
A :  Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . Um we decided chip on print would be used . Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling
A :  um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us .
A :  Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . And uh we closed as it ran out of time . Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? Okay , back to this meeting . Um we're down to the prototype presentation .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yep .
B :  Ta-da . Right .
C :  Alright .
A :  Over to you .
C :  Well .
A :  Ooh , two .
C :  Yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough . This is the one
A :  Ah .
C :  that I made .
A :  Uh-huh .
C :  It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . This is
C :  like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus . Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television . I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television . Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , but I'm sure it will work . Uh this is on off switch , 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance . And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . Um as for what it's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  Uh position , I presume that just means
C :  right right on it , easy to see . The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . Right ? Form
C :  curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold .
C :  Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . Also with on off switch and infrared uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So like uh well , I dunno , what's it like ? I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth .
C :  Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons .
C :  So we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . And what we
C :  well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it .
C :  Uh material yeah , that's what I have to say about material . Can I scroll down on there and see what else
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well colour , I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well .
C :  So , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm yeah , maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them .
B :  Um well I don't have very much to add . Um the the case oops , that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . We have the technology to do that . Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . Um so that's for material . Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that .
B :  Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really .
C :  I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . This one has n banana , yeah . This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded ,
B :  A banana .
C :  it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and
B :  Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ?
C :  Hold them , you see , you know . Curvature , is it to your liking ?
A :  Oh I see , the on-off's in the back .
B :  Yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it .
C :  If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all .
A :  And then you can use your thumb .
B :  And it was partly we thought the design looked better , but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in a different place .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the
C :  Breaking , oh right . Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid .
A :  you know yeah .
D :  I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role .
A :  Hmm .
D :  It's really kind of a
C :  Yeah , we really like we really like that design , I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . Like a c like a compass point , you know , just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel , but better . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , I mean it that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , I was try I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? It's texting .
D :  Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah . But it's also like texting , you don't
B :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  And it's a very simple design , there's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make .
D :  It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different . You know , I I d I have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know , this is really identifiable .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , but we do definitely think that it's a viable option .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . The next item is evaluation .
D :  No , okay .
A :  Uh if that's if you're finished .
D :  Um
C :  Uh yeah , we're finished .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  shall I take your uh power ?
A :  Oh sorry .
D :  Oh .
A :  Try again .
D :  Okay . This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers
D :  a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board .
D :  Okay . So um
D :  fancy ,
D :  technologically innovative ,
D :  easy to use , trendy ,
D :  buttons ,
D :  excess buttons , good buttons ,
D :  ugly ,
D :  sellable ,
D :  and other . And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap .
C :  Yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials .
D :  Mm , yeah , price .
A :  Hmm .
D :  We'll put price up at the top .
C :  Not that we actually know anything about it , but we can we can pretend .
A :  Well we will soon , unfortunately .
D :  Okay , so
A :  Come on .
D :  Did you say ? Uh okay , so
A :  No , .
D :  wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ?
C :  It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like
C :  baroque curliness and which
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I'd call these quite uh minimalist ,
B :  Yes , a plain , simple , clean design .
C :  simple and plain , but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , so in that respect it is quite fancy .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I yeah , so in that respect I think we'll go with that respect .
C :  I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I'd say maybe aesthetic .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Well we have got s trendy further down , but
A :  Elegant .
A :  Elegant .
D :  Elegant .
B :  Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant .
D :  Yeah , no these aren't the exact terms that the um
C :  like stylish or aesthetic .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Stylish , yeah .
D :  Elegant . We're gon let's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is
C :  Fancy .
D :  Yeah . N that um
C :  Did you just break the pen ?
D :  yeah uh the uh is fancy . So let's let's take it to the next level .
C :  Well d we'll just call it fancy then .
D :  Well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy .
D :  we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ? Should we go with the yellow in terms of I think that's a really superior they're both
C :  Yeah , I think we n we need to they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , so .
D :  Yeah .
D :  As a banana .
D :  I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , but I I do like the chunk .
A :  The chunk .
C :  So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it . Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two .
D :  No , but I mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them .
D :  Unless do you guys wanna evaluate both ?
A :  I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true .
B :  Yeah , I'd
A :  It's more true than false , about a two .
D :  Okay .
D :  So we say true . Um
D :  technologically innovative .
B :  I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative .
D :  Yeah . So we'll say we'll say uh false .
D :  Easy to use .
B :  Very .
C :  Yes .
D :  One , is that inappropriate ? Okay . Oh , pardon me . Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Trendy .
C :  Oh yes .
D :  trendy , s and I say specifically spongy fruity .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific
B :  We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . I think yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , but
D :  Okay , so two ? Um
B :  Yeah .
A :  Excess buttons . No .
D :  are there excess buttons ?
B :  No .
C :  No .
D :  That is false . Um good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons .
B :  So that's false .
A :  Better , more intuitive buttons , yes .
D :  True .
D :  Ugly .
C :  No .
B :  No .
A :  No .
D :  People don't respond well to ugly . Sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people like oh , yeah . Yeah , I do too .
B :  Yeah , I think they're different , aren't they ?
C :  Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think .
A :  I like it .
C :  It could be quite a good brand , like
D :  Oh yeah .
C :  a good little object .
D :  And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ?
D :  With the
C :  Oh , we also need tho think about the energy . Is it the kinetic energy ? If it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy .
D :  Yeah , with the energy .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
D :  It is going to be kinetic ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro .
D :  Uh so yes .
C :  Yeah , but we haven't
C :  completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that , but yeah .
D :  Well you're still in the Play-Doh stage . Anything else ? Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yes , the instinct says true .
D :  So true one or should I go to two or three ?
B :  I'd put it at one I think , but I dunno , what do you
D :  Okay .
C :  I would say maybe a two , 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus
C :  and things . I mean it's not just like I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . uh we need somebody to develop that .
B :  Yeah , true , it might be the yeah , yeah , true .
A :  Yeah , that's not a cheap thing to get .
B :  True .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah , that's a good point .
D :  other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ?
D :  And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that 'cause I have to do an average . And then um excess buttons .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
C :  Just putting no excess buttons .
D :  Exactly .
D :  Wow we're doing really well .
D :  Yeah , be you know , so it doesn't ruin the polarity .
C :  As for see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  but but we are at the upper end of the push button market .
D :  Or L_C_D_ .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those .
A :  I think we're good .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
A :  Okay . We're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance .
D :  So
A :  Okay .
D :  Um okay , how about if I uh pass this back to you and I'll uh figure out the average here .
A :  Yep .
A :  Right .
D :  Thank you for everyone's help with that .
A :  Right .
A :  And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . Um
A :  it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device .
A :  Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells .
A :  Okay .
C :  Well , just kinetic then , .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  what's a hand dynamo ?
C :  It's the wind-up .
B :  That was the crank , wind-up crank on the side .
A :  Oh shoot , forget that . Kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one .
B :  Just one .
A :  Okay . Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those .
B :  Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple
B :  Just checking that .
B :  Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest .
A :  Okay , and we only need one of those . Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . It looks like it single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . It's that's uh uh one .
B :  Yep .
B :  Yeah , that that one is single curve , isn't it ? Um do we have
C :  What does double curved mean , I don't understand .
A :  And that's
B :  I I think you it means you reverse the curve .
A :  uh that's the the one that goes like this .
C :  Oh no , we don't need that . No .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them , you can do a banana in single curve , yeah .
A :  Right .
C :  Single-curved , I'd say .
A :  No , single curve .
A :  Okay , case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . We had the special colour .
C :  I just wanna say plastic .
A :  And did we say plastic ?
B :  Yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , but it depends on the cost , I guess .
D :  One , two , three , four , five , six .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . Interface button push button interface . That's what we're using , isn't it ?
C :  It's just button .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep . Do we need to say how many buttons , or
A :  Whoops , don't want that , not yet . Um
B :  or d is it just one ?
A :  No , it just says push button interface . Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black .
B :  'Kay .
A :  And the buttons
A :  Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ?
B :  Uh they'll be rubber , yep .
A :  So we need one of them .
A :  And are they any special form ?
C :  Well yeah , like the compass point one .
B :  Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 'Cause I think they can be plastic .
A :  'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top .
B :  Yeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got a double curved case .
A :  Oh .
C :  Yeah , they could be plastic .
A :  Okay .
A :  let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement .
B :  It's just one , isn't it ?
A :  Uh we only need one of them .
A :  Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed .
B :  What , we're in .
D :  Yeah .
A :  We're in . That's us .
B :  More profit .
C :  Great .
A :  Okay , I'm going to save this into our
A :  desktop , project documents . Okay .
A :  As our project document bit .
B :  Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  There we are .
A :  That's the only Excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? Yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide . Right . Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity .
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , leadership ,
C :  Yeah .
D :  Sure .
A :  teamwork ,
D :  Yes .
A :  means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things .
C :  And Play-Doh .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought .
C :  Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . So much better just to go and ,
C :  you know , this is it , this is what we want .
B :  Yep .
A :  Okay .
A :  So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above .
D :  Yep .
A :  Um did we find any new ideas ?
D :  I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes .
C :  Yeah . Spongy .
D :  I I only speak for myself though .
C :  And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , so . Good work as a design team , because we
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I think we're a good team actually .
B :  I'm not sure all the wires are really great though .
A :  So we actually worked well as a group .
B :  I thought so .
A :  Right . Are the costs within the budget ? Yes . Is the project evaluated ? Yes .
C :  Oh yes .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yes .
D :  I can give you a number , um it's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two . I would say that's ex excellent
B :  Yes . Oh hang on , we haven't heard .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place .
C :  Yeah . And the the only false one is because we've chosen
D :  To maintain old technology , exactly .
C :  to keep a simple old technology , which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , so .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Absolutely , and it's kept us within budget .
D :  Yes .
C :  Yeah . So we do count as I think excellent or one .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright . And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , um and then we're done .
C :  .
D :  Okay .
C :  Bring on the ice sculptures .
A :  We done good , and we're finished in time .
D :  Nice .
B :  And then we get the product launch party . Product launch party ? Absolutely .
D :  So we might have to wait .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That's what I said , ice sculptures .
D :  Um I one thing I want to do is oh , I think the meeting's done .
C :  Is that the end of the meeting ?
A :  I believe that is the end of our meeting . Thank you , Melissa .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files , because I don't think everything is saved .
D :  The right files . Final meeting market
