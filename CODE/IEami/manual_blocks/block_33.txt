B :  Good morning , Flores .
A :  G good morning .
B :  Marketing Expert .
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  Right .
A :  Are you ready ? You should put the laptop uh right into the square . For i for the cameras , yes . Good morning , Sebastian .
B :  For the cameras
B :  Alright .
C :  Good morning , Mister P_M_ . How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ?
A :  I'm fine .
A :  Um well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . So Do you want to open it as read-only . Um I guess I should close it here .
B :  Geez .
B :  You have the same message of uh Windows cannot um
B :  sen oh stand-by . Close the the window .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud . Um project kick-off .
B :  So
B :  That's right . Ruud .
C :  Is there a schedule for this meeting ?
A :  Yes , there is actually . Um I will li list the agenda for today . For this meeting .
A :  Good morning , Ruud .
D :  Good morning .
A :  Uh it's important um yeah , great . It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras .
C :  I shall close the door .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Um we're here to develop uh a new product . Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it . Um and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . Um you are here in a specific role . Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . Is that correct ? Okay . Um we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That's correct .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Alright .
C :  Okay . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ?
A :  There is ? Yeah , there is .
C :  Okay .
A :  No problem . Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um
A :  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . The market , we should have a look at the market . Um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages .
B :  Okay .
A :  Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions , yes . Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific uh specification of that . Um the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .
B :  Progressions .
B :  It's for the vision . Yeah .
A :  Um and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . So we'll kop it keep it with the functional design . Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . Um as you see now I can give a presentation . Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um
A :  to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system . Um
A :  yeah , I will show that now . Um
A :  you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . Um
B :  Sensors .
A :  well , it it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button .
A :  Okay , so not too fast writing . Um
A :  you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . It's quite the same . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file . Just use this one uh during the day . Um you can use the eraser to
A :  make something go away .
B :  But we all use the same white-board file
A :  Yes .
B :  So we can work together on it while we're or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings . It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard . Um you can choose the format , um sorry . Uh
B :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah , alright . Yep .
A :  Let me see .
A :  Um
A :  Well
A :  I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected .
A :  Yep . Current colour , you can choose another colour . And um for example
A :  black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different
A :  line width and uh colour . Okay . Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . Um to um oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . Um as a little training um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected .
D :  Okay .
D :  Um green .
D :  An animal . Okay . Um
D :  Uh a wee rabbit .
B :  It's a bunny .
A :  A rabbit . Okay , well great . Um Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width .
C :  Alright .
B :  But of course , Flores .
B :  Blank .
A :  Sebastian is thinking about the animal .
C :  I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , I'm think about it too . Format .
B :  Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , right ?
C :  Well , I'll give it a try .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It it should be a cat . Okay ?
C :  Mm .
A :  I'm guessing a horse .
C :  Very good .
B :  With a very small legs .
C :  I was very good in drawing .
B :  You should feed that uh that animal .
C :  Well , I guess you uh get the idea .
A :  Yes , okay .
C :  Beautiful .
A :  Beautiful .
A :  Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions well , just just let me know . Um okay , back to our project . Um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros ,
A :  which is quite a number . Um we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , um because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation .
C :  Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh influations influences . Okay ?
A :  Limitations .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay , great .
C :  Okay .
C :  Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . Uh I also will propose some uh um
C :  uh some implementations for that , but well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .
B :  Okay .
C :  I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .
B :  And for a cell phone ?
C :  Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
B :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh
C :  is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .
B :  But
B :  Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But it's cost-effective .
C :  Yes .
C :  Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all . So that's the point . So
B :  y you you can
B :  Most of them . Or you shou sh use a you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .
C :  Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability , and
C :  Yes , so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments .
A :  Okay , and and uh
A :  Okay . Okay , good . Um that was your presentation ? Okay , okay . Um okay . Great . Um
C :  Okay .
C :  That's it .
A :  I'll go back to my own presentation . Um
A :  Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things . Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you . H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um
B :  Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?
A :  Yep .
B :  Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , right ?
C :  Yes , I think it should be something like that .
A :  Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , not we're we're it's not a
B :  Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh don't have the information for it .
C :  We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? No , we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .
A :  No . No .
B :  No , okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh Ruud , y do you agree ? Okay . Okay .
D :  Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .
B :  Um
B :  Well , the techni fu technical function uh what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function . So that was my really my part for uh this session . Um
A :  Yeah .
A :  So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device . It just should change the T_V_'s state . So that's it . Um but furthermore
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? Or are there any o other controls ? Are there only any other cont
B :  Yeah . Yeah , with buttons . Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or
C :  Well , I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords . You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch w yes , to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea , I don't know .
B :  But
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  They're very vu vulnerable .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , so you must point everywhere , so maybe infrared is
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
A :  Maybe not even pointed . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .
C :  Mm-hmm . Uh is that uh are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .
A :  Okay Uh
B :  Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or yeah . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think
B :  the range should be a problem to that , but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh
C :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting um okay .
B :  But
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Two more things . Um
B :  You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand . You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think . And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um in dark too . So when it's dark
A :  Okay , s yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Those are two really uh user interface
A :  Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . Is tha Okay . Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting . Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?
B :  Yeah . That's perfect .
C :  Okay . Do do you
D :  Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .
A :  Because ?
D :  Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  we'll probably have to implement that .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?
C :  Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago , but I've seem to forget them forgot them . Um oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark . Um
B :  Yeah .
C :  uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ?
C :  Which makes it easier to operate it .
B :  Yeah . Well , maybe I um but it it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . The uh the the digits in black . Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy well , it can be for design , of course .
C :  I I don't know .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . So
C :  Yes , but there's a cost limitation too . Well , that's more
A :  Yeah , twelve Euro fifty , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . The cost price is very low . Um
A :  Okay .
B :  Just remind something . The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade . You have a m uh
C :  Okay . Very good point . Yeah .
A :  Okay , okay .
B :  Always have s the soft buttons , always uh
B :  clear the the the paint on it . The marks .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .
C :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  So um
A :  maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or yeah . I dunno , it's uh that's more Sebastian's uh um
B :  But um
B :  Necessary , yeah .
B :  Yeah . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem . 'Cause I think Bluetooth uh
C :  Hmm .
C :  It's use uh a lot of uh well Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work uh quite okay . So uh technically it will be possible .
B :  Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .
A :  Well does it ? I'm not sure . Uh
A :  Yeah .
B :  But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . Does it
A :  Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time . Um
C :  No , you cannot .
B :  It's over ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so
A :  this was it . See you in thirty minutes .
B :  Okay .
B :  Great .
A :  Welcome back .
B :  Hello .
D :  Hello .
A :  Uh let me see .
B :  There's one of mine .
A :  Okay . Roo , welcome back .
B :  Hello , Flores .
A :  The waiting is for Sebastian .
B :  .
A :  There he is .
C :  Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? Can I get a cup of coffee ? Okay .
B :  We have a slight problem . I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys .
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Uh no . You can't , sorry .
B :  So just cancel it .
C :  Well , during my work I have no time either . So
A :  Well , this is life . Sorry uh , Roo .
B :  Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . Accidentally . But it's alright .
A :  Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting .
A :  Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it . Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I think so too .
A :  Roo ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Ruud ? Almost , okay . Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m
D :  Almost .
B :  But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe .
A :  Um we will figure that out . Ca can you try to
B :  Okay .
D :  Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the .
A :  Yeah , w we will see .
B :  I don't think it's wireless here . Or it is . Yeah ? Okay , great .
A :  Um it is , yeah .
C :  It is . It is .
D :  Uh okay .
A :  Yeah . Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um
A :  we have forty minutes . So
A :  it's now
A :  Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product .
A :  It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w uh uh we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with . Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um
B :  Yeah .
B :  Time , yeah .
A :  then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .
B :  Yes .
A :  Is that clear ?
A :  Any questions on these
A :  requirements ?
A :  No ?
A :  Okay . Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?
B :  Yeah , I'll start .
A :  Uh uh yeah . Okay , great .
C :  Yes .
B :  Um
B :  Oh , how can I uh
B :  Geez , and sli and show .
B :  Um
B :  Just uh press it . Uh yes .
B :  Alright .
B :  Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . Uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .
B :  So that was
B :  the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um but um yeah .
B :  My personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old . So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh Ruud , did you get that ?
D :  Yeah , uh b uh most .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so the important thing here is
B :  And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic . Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know .
D :  Oh , user-friendly .
A :  In the market , yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh
B :  Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Sebastian .
C :  Okay .
C :  Excuse me .
B :  Scusi .
C :  Um
C :  Okay , it's still the right thing .
C :  Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here , but it's hardly readable .
B :  Energies and uh
C :  Can you see it ? No ? Well
A :  No , it's not visible .
C :  Um , there's a energy source here . And um basically there it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . It's almost every piece of equipment um
C :  every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w yes . In the and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .
B :  Yeah .
B :  The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before , and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . So
A :  So it's fairly easy .
B :  Succeed in it also .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , good .
C :  Okay , so uh personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear . Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them .
A :  Okay .
C :  Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .
A :  Okay .
B :  And what's the um if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or
C :  No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . So we can use them . So that's no problem .
B :  Okay .
B :  For the same costs , it's can be uh in our
C :  Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making
B :  Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh
C :  We can we can make its I think .
D :  Well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .
D :  Or
C :  Okay .
B :  But I think
C :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm , true .
B :  Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , and not for
C :  Yes . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . No no no , no . That's right , that's right . So well , this uh should be it .
B :  Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  Um have a think about it .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , Ruud .
D :  Oh , mine is already outdated .
A :  Okay well , we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .
D :  Since uh
A :  So any income is welcome . Input .
D :  Okay , make
D :  Well
D :  Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units .
D :  Of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .
B :  Could you step a little bit more to the right ? Yeah , thank you .
A :  Okay .
D :  But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .
D :  Uh well , skip this .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Well , it's this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them .
C :  Mm .
D :  Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . Or
A :  Okay .
C :  Or a find a finding function , you know . That's quite a yes .
A :  Well , that's interesting .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's definitely interesting . It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . Okay , go on .
B :  Sound signal .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
D :  Well , I just said that . And uh well , this obvious , and he also said it .
A :  Okay . So that's what the market tells us .
D :  Uh that's about it , yes .
A :  Yep . Okay .
B :  The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . So
D :  Uh mo uh zap buttons most . Volume , they are uh use a lot . But
B :  Yeah , well it should just have a design
D :  more than all the other buttons . So
B :  The perfect design for those only those buttons . And first um
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . Well , the technical uh there I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
B :  Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? Another device is not a solution . It should be uh uh
D :  Yeah , that's uh a problem . Yeah .
C :  Yes . Th that's a bit of that's a problem . Usually
A :  Well maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , like um turning on and off the the the lights .
C :  Oh yes .
B :  Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .
C :  Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep . And um
A :  Reports rep respend response to it .
B :  Yeah , just like uh the phones the
C :  Yes . Yes , that's it .
C :  Yes , same thing .
D :  Yeah .
A :  But uh th
B :  But but T_V_s don't have all uh
C :  No , so we we should use something else .
B :  uh buttons . Uh
D :  And you
D :  Yeah , and usually
A :  Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um
B :  But I believe you will have an
C :  We do not control the T_V_ set so well .
D :  And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ , and it's
C :  Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , so we should think about
A :  Okay . So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se
B :  I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .
C :  It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .
A :  Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh
D :  And b
C :  Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time . But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .
A :  Yeah , a peak . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .
A :  Yeah , that's true .
C :  Yes , so we don't want that .
B :  But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something . Well if you lost th I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . Uh that's just uh
C :  Maybe we can
C :  Something like that . Well , is there not something f something more easily
A :  Well uh
C :  Well , I don't think uh .
C :  No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , so w we should use have uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .
A :  Yeah .
B :  just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .
C :  Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think . So that's not a good idea .
A :  Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , because that's his his field of expertise .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I will .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated um and it will become more costly also . Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
B :  And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh
C :  Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . So
B :  function ?
B :  It's a unique item uh
A :  Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . It's a different exactly . It's an uni an unique feature , and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .
B :  It will be an a unique feature of our remote control .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . What should we choose in in design ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . So
B :  Well , the extra functions .
D :  I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .
A :  Okay .
D :  Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function .
B :  Used option .
A :  Okay . Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that .
C :  Okay .
D :  Uh well yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .
A :  Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . Well , we skip that .
D :  So
D :  Yeah . Yeah . So
B :  Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff . So
A :  Okay .
C :  No , no . So that's out of the question . So
A :  No .
D :  Nope .
B :  Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . So
A :  Yeah .
A :  Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .
C :  I think also . Yes . Well , we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface and
A :  No .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple
D :  Uh well if we um include other uh innovative
D :  functions uh then they uh might , 'cause young people uh like new features . So
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's right .
A :  Okay , so this is is kind of uh
C :  Mm .
B :  Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .
C :  Okay . Well , is it maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions . Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless
A :  Yeah .
A :  But but are we not in in the in the manual uh I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh
C :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
C :  Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise .
B :  Yeah , I don't know yet .
A :  But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? Because we do not implement uh a user history .
C :  Mm-hmm . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . W
A :  I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that .
D :  And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .
A :  Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .
C :  Yes .
B :  But does it uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , should we just use a
A :  Yeah , draw draw it on the board .
B :  Um it's already uh oh , we have a blank .
B :  Oh .
C :  Oh yeah , something like that .
C :  It's not really a stick , but
B :  It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable
C :  Yes . Yes .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah , it can break down .
B :  when it's falling down or uh just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .
C :  Yes , yes .
D :  Yeah .
C :  And
C :  Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . I think it it will attract uh
B :  Yeah .
C :  more uh uh public , I think . But you're the marketing man .
D :  A younger uh Huh .
D :  And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .
B :  Geez .
B :  Well , volume and
B :  something uh
B :  like that .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  The programme up and down .
A :  Okay , yeah .
B :  And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want .
C :  Okay , that's good .
A :  Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that ,
A :  Um well , for we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah . We need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um
B :  I think .
B :  Yes ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
A :  uh our target audience .
C :  Okay .
B :  'Kay , but teletext is so uh is just scrapped .
C :  Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ?
A :  Um well , I do not want a full uh it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .
C :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  The ten digits .
A :  Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but
B :  Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm . Yes .
A :  Yeah .
A :  A bit of a split mode . Uh l like Yeah . Dual channel watch . Okay , well um m maybe I should write that down . Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ?
C :  Change . Yes , yes .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well you're the secretary .
D :  Mielsen .
A :  Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um
C :  Mm okay , but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already .
B :  Alright .
A :  Yeah , that's that's if you want to do it , Sebastian .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Sure .
B :  Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh
C :  .
B : 
A :  Okay , um
A :  Okay , so so um uh
A :  Volume . Programme .
A :  Uh dual channel . Uh
C :  Yes , that's important .
A :  And and do we want um
A :  the ten digits ?
B :  The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so .
C :  Well , are are you sure ? I'm not so sure .
D :  Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well , that's complicated , but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should uh shou you should know that .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I wouldn't buy it personally .
C :  If it were so .
B :  A remote control without the ten digits . Uh and I think the most
C :  Okay , I can imagine when
A :  I agree actually .
C :  I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough .
B :  Just elder elder people would would buy it , but
D :  Well
A :  But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .
D :  But
B :  Yep .
C :  Well , but how how often do you watch all these channels ?
D :  Yeah , and if if we
B :  The older people only use five of them .
D :  And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . So
A :  Often .
C :  No , you're probably right .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ?
A :  Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the
C :  The design . Okay . Well , y then there should be should done be done something specific with it .
B :  On the design .
D :  Well
A :  You c you can d make them very fancy by um
D :  And
A :  I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . So I'm I'm I do not agree
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh
C :  Okay , so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . Okay .
A :  Exactly , exactly .
D :  And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh
A :  Okay , speech .
D :  for
C :  Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . And it's very easy uh to find your remote control .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  To find yeah .
C :  So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . But maybe when we uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh
A :  If if we would um drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume , because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay , okay .
D :  Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but
A :  Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision .
D :  Yes .
C :  Okay . Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that .
B :  So we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So that's that's a big advantage , I think .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , g good .
A :  Okay .
C :  There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . But maybe can we we can think something smart about it . There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . You have to do nothing for it .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay . But
A :  But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?
B :  Twelve dollar fifty .
C :  Maybe , maybe not . I'll have to find that out .
A :  Because it seems like a very
D :  And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge ,
C :  Yes . So
D :  then there wouldn't be uh a big problem . 'Cause when
C :  No , that's very cheap .
A :  Is a cradle very cheap ?
C :  It's Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .
A :  I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well .
C :  It's
C :  Yes , but they're they're mass production . They're very cheap . So it will cost us p practically nothing .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um
A :  I would like to hear um maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?
D :  Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh
D :  want to sell to .
D :  So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people . But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  I don't think that's a big problem
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh
D :  Yes . Yeah , profitable .
C :  Profitable .
A :  Profitable . We we yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . Okay . O okay .
D :  Yes .
A :  Um Roo .
B :  I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think .
A : 
A :  Nothing to add .
A :  Sebastian ?
C :  Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Great .
C :  so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one the those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that these kinds of things .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons .
A :  Yep .
C :  If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . And this even uh makes it more cheapy . So
A :  Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board
A :  Yeah .
B :  But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? The circuit board .
C :  Mm-hmm . The circuit board .
A :  The board .
B :  The fewer buttons you can use on it .
C :  The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .
A :  No , it's th yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
A :  It's the other way around , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's
C :  that's another advantage .
A :  It shouldn't be a big issue .
B :  Well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition .
C :  So
C :  Yes , because I don't know
C :  Yes . I d I really don't know . So
B :  No .
C :  It can be costly . Maybe not .
A :  Okay . I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . Maybe you will get some information on that . Um I'm not sure how how that
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh have a lo uh look at it .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay , great . Um
A :  well , I think we're qui quite done . Um for now we will have the lunch break .
B :  We're done , I think .
C :  How nice .
A :  Um I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . If you want to look at it um well , just do . Um the Interface Designer , um I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept . Uh Roo , um from you I would like to see
B :  Me neither .
B :  Interface industrial .
A :  Uh
A :  I'm sorry , yeah , I'm sorry . User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . And um
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well , we understand .
B :  Uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition . Well
C :  Well
A :  Well , i it should be easy , that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um
C :  Mm yes .
B :  Yeah .
A :  um yeah , some some fancy lights . I think that's what we decided .
C :  So we drop the voice recognition ? Or Oh .
A :  No no no , we didn't but it shouldn't be integrated yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the
C :  Okay . Well um do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting ?
A :  No .
A :  We can decide the next meeting . Yep .
C :  Okay .
C :  Because I'll have some updated info on that uh
A :  Yeah . I guess all of you have i updated info . I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching . And I'm sure the market will um uh
B :  Yep .
D :  Hmm .
A :  uh will change , adapt and um so we will see that . Um yeah , that's it for now .
B :  Adapt .
C :  Adapt .
D :  Left .
D :  Hmm .
B :  That's it .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Any other questions or can we have the lunch ?
C :  We can have the lunch .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay . Good .
B :  I'll take the lunch .
A :  Do you need to change anything on it ? Because otherwise I will already open it .
D :  Um
D :  Mm , don't think so .
A :  Okay .
D :  Unless uh things have suddenly change again .
A :  Is it much changes ?
D :  Uh don't know . Maybe uh you've got new information , like uh last time .
A :  Uh I didn't No no . I do hot have
A :  Only the same information .
D :  Okay .
A :  Hello , Sebastian .
C :  Hello hello Mister P_M_ .
A :  I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room .
C :  Well , that's where the thinking goes on .
A :  Oh , it's that Roo again , always late . Bongiorno .
B :  Bongiorno .
C :  I think you should punish him . You're the P_M_ .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Punish .
A :  I see some interesting okay .
C :  Possibilities , yeah ?
B :  You wish .
A :  People , welcome back .
B :  Welcome . Uh
A :  The third meeting . Um I have some points I would like to uh some some issues I would like to point out . Um first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ?
D :  Oop .
A :  If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down , so I could uh can uh um use that in the in the report . Um the second thing , um
B :  Yeah .
A :  I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared .
A :  That's quite strange .
C :  Yes .
A :  Okay . We'll come to that later , I g I think . Um the agenda for now uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ?
C :  So
B :  No .
C :  Not at all .
D :  No .
A :  Okay . Um we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this . So um I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made . Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation .
C :  Okay .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Hmm ?
B :  Alright .
D :  Oh .
D :  .
C :  Just press the okay button , it works .
D :  Yeah ,
D :  Okay .
A :  Um yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  My method ?
C :  How surprising .
D :  Well , findings . Uh
D :  Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables
D :  in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they want spongy material .
D :  Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .
D :  Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes uh m material . But we since we are concentrating on uh
D :  the younger group
A :  Uh w wait a sec wait a se uh could you go to the previous slide ? Um because I'm taking minutes and it
C :  Oh wait uh wait up .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Um were the important themes enclose . Yeah okay . The feel of to be spongy
C :  Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?
D :  Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .
C :  Not something dull .
C :  Okay .
B :  But they like dark colours , you said in the p
D :  No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful
B :  Okay .
D :  objects . But
B :  Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow . I had
C :  But can you can you go back to that slide ? The uh just one slide back , no no no .
D :  Which one ? This ?
C :  Yes .
C :  Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .
D :  Yes .
C :  Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ?
D :  Uh well , it might . But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . But
D :  Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .
A :  Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . It it maybe it rubber or or yeah . Okay .
D :  Yeah , exactly .
D :  Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials , but that doesn't mean we should use wood ,
B :  Or we could make oh .
D :  So
C :  Okay .
D :  Well , this this is an example of what they would like . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group ,
D :  I think we should use soft materials
D :  and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So we could provide
D :  both for the young and the old what they like .
A :  Well , that's interesting .
C :  It's quite interesting .
A :  You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .
B :  Yeah , o o
C :  Yes .
B :  I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone . It's the it's the rubber uh
A :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah , it is , it is i yeah .
B :  cover . And it's uh colourful . It looks likes a banana . We have the fruit , we have the colours . We have the simple design .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Do you know the phone ?
C :  I don't know the phone , but I can imagine it .
A :  It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five , I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away , the very
B :  Um thirty five .
C :  Oh , that one , yes . Now I kn uh oh , I know , I know .
B :  And the b the light blue and it's also in yellow .
C :  Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it .
A :  You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th
D :  I've seen it , but
A :  Okay . Okay . Um uh okay . Do you have uh thit that was Okay . Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group . And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials . Okay .
D :  'Kay . Uh that's about it .
D :  Yes .
D :  Uh soft material .
C :  So So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ?
D :  Uh the fancy look and feel .
C :  Okay . So that's the most important thing for our customers .
D :  Yes . Apparently .
A :  Okay , Roo ,
B :  Yeah .
A :  could you do your presentation ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh
B :  the previous uh discussion .
B :  Um
A :  Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .
B :  Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um , well , a weird um
A :  Shape .
B :  shape . So I suggest I couldn't uh I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper . But it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um
B :  PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .
C :  Mm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .
A :  Yeah . And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control . Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery , s because um
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
C :  Slippery .
B :  But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber . So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed .
C :  You have to grab it .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , exactly .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier . So m
A :  Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , okay .
C :  Yes . But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .
A :  Okay , good .
B :  Great .
B :  Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal , yeah .
B :  So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty uh um
A :  Okay , b but I think we'll yeah .
B :  thirty c uh controls on it .
C :  Okay , but I'll I'll go into that , because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing .
C :  We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape . Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that . But it's quite uh advanced and it's
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
C :  it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source . Which brings me to the different energy sources . Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls . You really have to imagine like winding up your uh I d
B :  Great .
A :  Well , it would be very new to the market , but
C :  It would be very new , but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think . Uh Well , this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish . It have it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Like the watch .
A :  I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny . I mean solar is of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel . Um hand dynamo
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  It's very funny indeed .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Indeed .
B :  But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also . You you walk and uh but uh you you're sitting on a couch .
A :  Well , maybe m
A :  Yeah , I know .
C :  Mm-hmm . Yes . But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something , well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And wha
A :  Okay .
C :  So , but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power . Yeah .
C :  Uh yes , it does . I'll come to that later . And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it .
A :  Okay .
C :  Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .
C :  Yes . That is possible too . Yes .
B : 
B :  But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too . I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels . I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well
C :  Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions .
A :  This will be the remote , right ? Um with uh maybe a channel selector .
B :  Yeah .
A :  What about
A :  integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?
B :  Yeah , uh that's a possibility , but
C :  Uh it's do it's done before . Yes . It's quite quite good , yes .
A :  Because this is how you keep it
B :  But Flores ,
B :  think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for
A :  Volume ?
C :  Well , it's it well , i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel . There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel .
B :  A volume , okay .
A :  Well , what about mute ?
C :  About mute . Well , yes .
A :  Thi i i m I guess uh th this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um
C :  Okay .
C :  Yes .
C :  Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .
A :  And click it to muten the device .
C :  Well , okay . It's quite goods .
A :  And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to
A :  uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . So maybe um I guess that that's something you two uh need to think about . Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel .
C :  Mm-hmm . Yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Um
B :  Wheel .
D :  Uh well , it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers .
C :  Hmm . But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this . And
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now . So maybe it's not no
A :  Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . Nokia has a well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .
C :  .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .
A :  Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah .
C :  It doesn't use a . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here .
A :  For you too , yeah .
B :  Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .
C :  Wi within reach . Yes , you have to .
C :  Yes .
C :  yes .
C :  Yeah , yeah . Okay . Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved . There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation .
A :  Okay . Sebastian . Um
A :  Yeah .
C :  About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .
B :  Yeah yeah , you can um I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute . Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . So that's the sample sensor . So if you say mute , it says mute again , and then it's um well , I believe it's uh
C :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
C :  Okay . So so okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It performs the action . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is . So you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .
A :  Okay . Uh well uh d did we already decide on the display ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here
A :  To
B :  Yeah . Well , I don't have um I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information uh y I don't think you need it on a display . Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh 'cause uh uh all any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen , yeah .
C :  to think about .
A :  No .
C :  I I don't think either .
C :  No . I don't think you need it .
A :  On screen display . Yeah . Okay th
C :  Okay . Okay , well my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper . So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries . Otherwise it will not too advanced , uh well . It's in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries . But
A :  Okay . Good .
A :  Kineti okay .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy , too yeah .
A :  Yeah , but that that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different .
C :  Yes . And I think it's more robust . It's more uh
A :  Yeah . Okay .
B :  But what about um the markets
C :  Uh it's more functional .
B :  uh wants colourfuls
B :  uh designs ? So if you use titanium
A :  No no , but the uh um that's what Sebastian said . He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different . So um
C :  The titanium thing uh
C :  we have to skip it .
B :  Okay .
B :  Oh , sorry . Yeah .
C :  So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff , and we should uh use wood or something like that .
B :  Yeah .
D :  And yeah , the yeah , the older people liked wood .
B :  And I would think
A :  No , r rubber with colours .
C :  Oh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber .
D :  No the
A :  Colourful and
D :  Yeah , the younger people liked soft material .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay , spongy materials . Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy . So
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?
C :  Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple
B :  Okay , but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker oh , evalu
C :  Well , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh a different
A :  But but do we want the curved uh uh design , or
C :  I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull . I don't think c our customers will like it . And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . So I think this is the best of two worlds .
A :  I it's too dull . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Okay , what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour
C :  Yes .
C :  It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . It's very unlogical .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .
C :  Well the there has to be some pointing at . But
A :  Well
A :  It depends also on your on your
B :  Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just to the other wall . Yeah .
A :  Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably you're probably right . But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .
C :  All lights get absorbed , yeah .
C :  Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light . So it has an it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker .
A :  So
A :  Yeah .
C :  Um with a with a regular chip .
B :  And the regular chip .
C :  I think uh it gives us the advantage of
B :  And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yeah .
C :  Yes , yes . And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part . I don't think it it's any uh value added thing . So
A :  I like the scroll wheels uh idea .
A :  Yeah .
B :  No . Think so too .
A :  Well , it looks uh yeah , well um according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology , and I mean L_C_D_ is well , ok I know , but it's m it's less um s standard than than
C :  Okay .
C :  Technology .
C :  Yes . It's not very flashy and new .
D :  Standard ?
A :  Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . That's the problem . Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it , because
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .
C :  Yes .
B :  But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber ,
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Uh I think our customers will go insane . It's it's too much .
B :  the fancy colours .
A :  Okay , okay .
A :  Yeah . Okay , I I agree . I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to
A :  um add or or maybe thoughts or
D :  Nah , um n no , I don't think so . M
A :  No ? Sebast uh nee , Roo ? Roo , do you have any other
B :  Um no .
B :  Nothing more .
A :  Nothing more . Um
C :  Okay .
C :  Uh the n the next phase will be um
C :  the um not the what is the next phase f Flores ?
A :  Well , we we need to describe uh decisions now . So um on the energy , well , we decided . Chip .
C :  Okay .
C :  So i
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve . User interface um
C :  Okay , okay .
B :  Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? Yeah , okay . Sorry , yeah .
C :  Yes , they can work . They cannot work with double-curved . That's that's problem . I'll check it for you .
B :  Oh , sorry . Yeah .
A :  Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Keep it in mind . And um the buttons , well we talked about it now . The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design . And for you , the product evaluation . Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that . Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .
C :  Yes .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
A :  And I'm going uh to plan my holidays .
C :  Okay . So you will be on the Bahamas . Uh
B :  The project drawing is for the next
A :  Yeah , it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready .
B :  Yeah , right .
C :  Okay . So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?
A :  Yeah ? I can . Um maybe one of you could write it down . Great . Um
C :  I'll do .
A :  Uh you you need to help me . Um
C :  Okay . W start with the casing .
A :  The casing is curved , single-curved .
B :  Single-curved .
C :  Okay , single-curved case . Okay .
C :  What about the energy source ?
A :  Traditional batteries uh and solar .
B :  But can there be uh wor can they work together ? Or do we have to choose between them ? 'Cause if we have to choose yeah ?
A :  No , they can be complementary . Uh al al I uh
C :  I I think they can . Yes .
B :  Okay . What if not ?
C :  Well , uh
A :  Every device
C :  It it should be . There should be really no problem . They can be supplementary . That's no problem . So
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Okay , um th
C :  So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar . Okay .
A :  Battery and solar , yeah .
C :  What about uh the finishing of the case ?
C :  We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?
A :  Yeah , with colourful rubber . Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . uh black and yellow .
A :  Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah .
B :  Grey and yellow .
C :  Grey yellow , okay .
B :  Yellow case and grey buttons , I think .
A :  Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course , but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Oh , I think it's uh it's not very dull . It's quite modern actually . Don't you think ?
A :  Well , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .
B :  I believe the
B :  But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button .
B :  And um
A :  Well , it it doesn't have to be red .
B :  Well well
A :  Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image or or I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Okay .
D :  Or black and yellow .
A :  Black and yellow , yeah .
C :  Okay , but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But
B :  Well , there is . Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print , with and uh
C :  Oh , I've read . Yes .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . They're actually very slow in its techniques .
B :  No .
A :  Okay , so we have to deal with wh what's possible here .
C :  So
C :  So I'm afraid it's not possible .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Um more f more more decisions we made . Um
A :  Um
B :  A scroll-wheel .
A :  The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided .
B :  Voice recognition , of course .
C :  Okay , so scroll-wheel . But there will be some additional buttons , I guess . And th the they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two .
B :  What what did you say ?
C :  Well uh you can use well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too . So it has th the spongy uh feel also . So I I think that's okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons .
B :  In the rubber .
A :  I think rubber is nice . Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i
B :  Yeah , b
B :  But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .
A :  .
B :  What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .
A :  Uh is that uh does our our supplier say so ?
B :  It is not uh something uh it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from
D :  Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ? 'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .
B :  No , but but uh it
A :  Yeah . You could place a um uh this this would be the button .
D :  There the icons .
A :  The scroll-wheel , I mean . And you could place
B :  Yeah , b yeah .
A :  the indica th th the signals the
C :  Yes .
D :  So you don't touch the icons that much .
C :  That's okay .
B :  Yeah , that's possible , but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case .
B :  So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .
A :  No no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or
B :  Yeah .
A :  But it's into the rubber .
B :  Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus .
C :  Yes , the signs .
B :  You have to draw the
A :  Yeah , but this is on the pla yeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean . What about um making this rubber
B :  Yeah , it's on the cover . So if you uh
B :  You just move the problem .
A :  and making this plastic ?
C :  Uh I see what you mean .
C :  Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two .
A :  Yeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel . But the front ,
C :  Yeah .
A :  on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber . I mean
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well , I'm I'm not so sure , I think it c should be
B :  Y uh can you separate these uh these
C :  Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .
A :  I know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ?
C :  I think both .
A :  I mean , I I never touch between the buttons .
B :  I do . Or the s uh the sideways . Or the the back . Or the back .
C :  I do .
C :  I think
A :  Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , but do you touch between the the these buttons ?
B :  I think
B :  Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . So you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it .
A :  Okay . Well , we do not have very much time uh left . Um I guess you two have to figure that out . I'm going to leave the decision to you , um because you have to make its prototype , and um yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh so I'm going to leave it the decision with you . Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Um not quite . Um what about
C :  uh the chips ? We use the regular chip ? Okay .
B :  Regular .
A :  Yeah .
C :  And
B :  Use with .
C :  Well no , I think that's about it .
C :  Yes .
A :  Okay . With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . The chip is is not really
C :  The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . That's all . And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ . So
A :  Okay , well .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Um okay , then I think we are uh quite finished .
A :  Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um
B :  .
B :  For the finishing touch .
A :  Yeah ? Yeah , um if you write wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  Uh yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But um
B :  Sebastian has everything .
A :  I know , but well
C :  I'll put it online .
A :  Great .
A : 
C : 
A :  Right .
B :  That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . But uh we don't uh we don't uh we do think it's um well what if with ease of use , w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers .
C :  Like this one .
C :  It's important .
C :  Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . But other users who are new to this device need something like that . They n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them
A :  Okay .
A :  Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ?
C :  Yeah , maybe so . Yes , it's
A :  A a and the voice recognition as well , th maybe you could uh could uh
C :  Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um . There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . It's it's quite easy .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Okay , good . And and the case is is rubber ?
C :  Yes , rubber ?
A :  And the buttons ?
B :  Plastic or rubber . Well , yeah .
C :  There are plastic or rubber .
A :  Okay , and uh the colouring ?
C :  Uh yellow with uh
A :  with with grey or black .
C :  grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least .
A :  Okay , we'll we'll come to that later . Um
A :  okay . Anything else to add or
C :  No . Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . But
A :  Yeah .
D :  Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels .
C :  Yes , but it but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think . Or not ?
A :  M uh yeah . M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .
D :  You
C :  Well okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that .
B :  And a button for disabling the voice recognition .
A :  Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and but o okay , that that's not really really important .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
B :  That's the basic idea , yeah .
A :  The basic okay .
B :  Of our prototype .
A :  Okay . Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?
D :  Yes .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh my name is not name but
A :  You are nameless .
D :  Uh well , I used the the uh documents .
D :  And these uh
D :  were the most important criteria .
C :  Is it spongy ?
D :  It should be . yeah , that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . Fancy look and feel . So
B :  So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything I believe uh
D :  Uh well appar
B :  I believe it's fancy .
C :  I believe it's fancy too .
D :  Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . So
A :  No .
B :  Oh , sorry .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , so this these are the cr uh the criteria .
D :  Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria .
A :  Okay , well
D :  So uh that's about it .
A :  the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um
A :  The production costs . The costs are not under
A :  Can I
A :  Um this is the
B :  Twenty two .
A :  Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty . And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . So I guess we should skip that , because it's not that important .
B :  Yikes .
C :  Well it's very expensive .
C :  Okay .
B :  Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa yeah .
A :  Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um if you would if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um
B :  The number of uh yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  And and does it
A :  to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I
A :  did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price . Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , I believe
A :  Uh , push-button , well
A :  It makes it the thirteen yeah .
A :  Push-buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . So um yeah , th this design is not um
C :  Hmm .
A :  within our price model .
C :  Okay .
A :  Um
C :  But I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So it's c way too expensive .
A :  It's still too expensive , yeah . Um
B :  But that's that's only for the buttons . So the button we can use plastic .
A :  I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out , um oh .
A :  And uh maybe not use the special form .
B :  And the pla uh
B :  And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .
C :  But it
A :  It becomes a very dull remote control , I know . But it's the board decision . Um
C :  Yes .
A :  And um yeah .
C :  Well , b basically it when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . So
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh
C :  Type of m maybe another market segment .
A :  Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic and uh m maximise the profits and um
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
C :  That's maybe that's better . Maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple , but that's not what uh has been asked .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I know , I know .
C :  So we should kick the board's uh Well
A :  Yeah . Although I think we yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yes .
A :  Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no .
A :  It's not that innovative . Or however you s pronounce that . Um so , okay .
B :  Yeah , too bad .
A :  Um
A :  Oh , this is the wrong one .
A :  So uh that means redesign .
A :  We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . Um but we can evaluate the process and um uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first .
A :  I guess
D :  Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's true .
C :  Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . So
A :  We l we can learn .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I agree . Well
C :  Is it fancy ?
A :  I d it is it is
D :  Uh
D :  Yay .
D :  Is it ?
D :  Is it fancy ?
A :  Yeah , I think so .
B :  Um the yellow rubber , I think so .
C :  I think so .
A :  You like the rubber , uh Roo .
B :  I'm into it .
D :  So uh one ?
A :  Yeah . No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two .
C :  But it's not that fancy .
C :  I mean
C :  I think uh I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing . It would be even more oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it .
A :  You like tita
A :  That's a flavour as well .
C :  It has flavour . Yes , that's right . You should taste it .
A :  Right . Um
D :  Is it uh
A :  Yeah , I know , but but it but that's fancy in the way um
A :  I mean fancy has has a lot of
C :  It has to do with fashion , I guess . So do
A :  Yeah .
B :  It's trendy trendy , fun yeah .
D :  And w yeah , w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials . So in that way
A :  Yeah .
A :  It applies . It yeah .
D :  It it's fancy .
B :  Well , just give it a two .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yes . I think I th I think it would have been I would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . So
B :  It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but
B :  Yeah , but that's sti that's uh
B :  Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three .
C :  Yes .
B :  So I believe uh we are close uh to two .
A :  Yeah , I I agree .
C :  Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did yes , we did good .
D :  Okay , and uh was it
D :  innovative ?
A :  Well , with the voice recognition feature and uh
B :  But that's not in it . Ov or can we
D :  Yep .
C :  Well , let's let's this product .
A :  No , we are evaluating this this uh design now .
B :  Okay .
C :  So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative .
A :  This prototype .
A :  Yeah .
B :  And the scroll uh wheel . The solar not many remotes
B :  have the solar , I think .
C :  No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too yes , but
D :  Yeah , and uh
A :  That would have been a thrill .
D :  So uh also a uh two ?
C :  I think uh it's a two .
A :  Yep .
D :  Is it easy to use ?
A :  I'm not sure .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I'm not sure .
B :  Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think .
B :  Well , hard it's not for the for the e for the elderly .
C :  Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions .
B :  They won't use it .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So in that in that way it is advanced ,
A :  Yeah .
C :  and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .
B :  I think
C :  So uh
C :  It's maybe it's not very uh easy for
B :  I think a three . Wouldn't give it more .
A :  Uh I'm doubting doubting as well . Um
D :  Well the p the most important function is easy to use .
A :  Yeah .
D :  The the zapping , channel switching , volume .
D :  But the more advanced functions are probably
D :  a bit harder .
A :  Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,
A :  Yeah .
C :  because he is already he or she is already an advanced user . So
A :  Yeah .
C :  After all , I think personally I would give a two . But
A :  Um
A :  Okay . Uh Roo , a three ? Ruud ?
B :  Yep .
D :  Good question .
D :  Uh I'll go uh for the two .
A :  Okay .
C :  So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten .
A :  So I could make it e easy ?
B :  If you make it a four it will be three in general .
C :  So that's w
C :  No , two and a half .
B :  If he makes it a four .
C :  Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half .
B :  Not a three .
C :  So
B :  Darn . Nee .
D :  Hmm ? Huh ?
C :  Yes .
A :  Roo .
B :  A seven , a three No . A four and a three together . Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? And a three ? Nee . I know .
D :  Yeah . I yeah .
C :  Four ?
D :  Yeah , two , two , three
C :  Two ?
A :  No , I haven't said anything yet .
D :  No .
A :  Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five .
C :  Divided by four .
B :  Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four
A :  But I'm filling in a three . Does it will so it will be a two point five .
C :  That's not even
C :  But that's not possible to fill in , so we have to round it .
A :  Yes , it is . I have a veto . Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about okay , um is it easy to f
D :  Is it easy to find ?
A :  Yeah , definitely .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .
C :  It it most definitely is it's very easy .
A :  Yeah , or beeps or yeah .
B :  Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh
C :  Yes .
C :  Maybe Uh I I think I think something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . So , I th
A :  I'm here , I'm here .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But even without it
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well , I uh we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . Um Sebastian ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , me too .
B :  Me too .
D :  Yeah , I agree .
A :  Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh it can't be more spongy . So
C :  Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . No , it's not one of our option , but when you look in the market , when you look
B :  Was it one of our options ?
D :  No . Uh this this was a most spongy option .
A :  No okay , but but
B :  So , in the in
A :  for the options given , it's the most spongy one .
C :  Uh yes , but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market . So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . Yes , but it's not good enough , so it's a two .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  They're out there . Yeah .
B :  But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could .
A :  I'll give it a one .
B :  I wan I'll take one .
C :  You take one ? What do you give it ?
D :  Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could but yeah .
A :  Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number .
A :  Because we need to go on in for the time .
D :  Well , if I give it a one
B :  It will be a one .
D :  there'll be one hell of a calculation . So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .
C :  No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four .
A :  You are okay . The remote control offers enough features . Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?
D :  Well , the basic layout doesn't offem offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So
C :  Basically it's it's completely programmable . You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .
D :  Yeah , depends .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I know . What what we didn't talk about is um uh
C :  So it's quite advanced .
B :  Yeah , but it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's
B :  If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think
B :  it is it has all the features um a normal remote has .
A :  I think it has .
D :  Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat
A :  Yeah . Bec because you can um we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So , you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um the the signals . So you could uh uh uh
C :  Yes .
C :  Has uh the signals sent to it .
D :  Signal .
B :  Yeah .
A :  enter any comment you like , as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal .
A :  So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .
C :  Absolutely .
C :  Yes .
C :  But that that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple . You can use your voice to to programme it . It's
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
A :  Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .
B :  I'll give a two .
C :  Yeah , I'll give it a one .
D :  Um I think think a one , 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um
C :  Yes . I I've I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . So
A :  Yeah . So high quality , low acceptance .
C :  Hmm .
A :  The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But
C :  Yes .
A :  whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure . D do you agree ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yes , I agree . I
D :  Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .
A :  Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh function .
C :  Yeah , okay . But
C :  Yes .
B :  But we could couldn't uh what what's the selling price ? Fifty ? Uh twenty five .
A :  Twenty five Euros .
B :  And costs were twelve fifty . But even now , if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double ,
A :  Yeah .
B :  Think . Production cost was were t uh was twenty two ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So uh selling price uh would be uh yeah .
C :  M about fifty Euros .
C :  That's quite ex well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
B :  That's price , but w w
B :  No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh
C :  Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes .
B :  Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .
A :  Bu but well yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros .
C :  Yes . Yes , but you can you c
C :  Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions . And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does . So I think it's worth its price .
A :  Yeah .
A :  .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um
D :  Yeah , but uh with these ratings uh
A :  That's counting .
C :  Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that .
D :  should be about one point s seven , yeah .
B :  Four six seven eight .
A :  Okay .
B :  Nine divided by six .
A :  Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation .
A :  About the project itself , not about the product .
A :  Um
A :  What did you think about uh
A :  the process , the project process ?
A :  Ruud ?
A :  Try to translate that .
C :  Well
B :  Hmm .
A :  Any any other Uh , Roo ?
C :  Well , I think
B :  Yeah , I think uh
A :  Roo .
B :  The process was good .
B :  But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made the the choice between what yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
C :  Actually , we had
A :  Better decision .
C :  Yes . We had we had too little information actually . So And uh um the the the well , looking at room for creativity , there was
A :  Yeah .
C :  w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow . So there was not really a process of uh
A :  Less .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So we could we we could be we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .
C :  Well
C :  Yes .
D :  The prices .
C :  Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative . We we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . So
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  We're tempered by that , yes .
A :  Okay , Roo ?
A :  Any other thoughts on that ?
B :  No , no .
A :  Ruud ?
D :  I agree .
A :  You agree , okay . Uh leadership . Okay , Roo's on for his promotion .
B :  Fantastic .
C :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  I think we're a good team .
A :  I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh . Um
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well , I tried once , but that was not allowed .
A :  Yeah . So um
A :  Yeah , but but si uh w w w when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well .
C :  I think so too .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Um the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ?
C :  Uh . The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad . It it's
B :  Yeah .
A :  Because of the response or
C :  The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited . It's not accurate .
B :  Response and
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh it it has yeah . Yeah , it's not accurate . The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its um uh where it uh
A :  Uh
D :  Draws .
B :  Yeah , where it draws . It's uh the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen .
A :  Okay , so it it had to be um
B :  So uh
B :  You to take in account that your you m yeah uh
A :  better aligned , or what's the word ? Uh yeah .
C :  Maybe it's it needs to be calibrateds .
B :  It's too slow
A :  It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting . So uh it's not the calibration , it's the thing itself , I think . Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ? Not at all .
C :  It is ? Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  Hmm .
D :  No . Not really .
A :  Okay . I thought it was quite a handy uh thing , although I would like to see um O_C_R_ .
C :  I I think so too .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yep .
C :  Yes .
B :  If it has O_C_R_ , uh I think uh I would use , but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it . It w it w yeah . It was necessary for me to uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  To digitise them .
B :  Yeah , because if I want something on the computer , I just type it . I type faster than I write . So
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way . I think it's a good product . I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big . It's not quite uh ergonomic .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Economic .
C :  Eco ergonomic .
A :  I know .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Um
A :  What w Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ?
D :  Oh , I only use it to draw a rabbit , so can't say much about it .
A :  Yeah . Okay , you can't really decide . No . I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or
C :  Yes .
D :  No , or the other way around .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Or the other way around , that you could show but m
C :  Yes , yes .
B :  But y you can if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . So it's almost yeah .
C :  That's quite what PowerPoint does .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I know .
A :  I know , but
A :  I know , but we couldn't use that feature , so I missed it .
B :  Yep .
A :  We weren't able to do that .
A :  At least the um I wasn't explained how to do such a th
B :  Mm-hmm . . A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object .
C :  An object , yes . Yes . The drawing cap capabilities are very limited .
B :  I it's not possible yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  And and uh w you were when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing . And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . So it's
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh it looks like paint actually .
A :  Okay , so y it it's not even as advanced as paint .
C :  Not not uh n not way . It's quite uh limited .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh no . Yeah , the project is evaluated . Um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product .
C :  Okay . Oh , very good , celebration .
A :  Celebrate .
C :  Pop uh pop up the champagne .
B :  Great .
B :  It was a privilege working with you .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um you're dismissed . No , I think we are uh ready .

C :  I see some action over there .
A :  Private room , Roo .
A :  That sounds quite scary .
C :  Okay .
A :  No , let's find uh the way to
A :  . .
C :  uh we're done , we're finished , I believe . So ,
C :  are there any more cycles in this process ? I think not .
A :  I don't believe so . Well , maybe we'd
A :  get an email .
A :  Thank you for your
C :  But um how much time did we get for this meeting ?
A :  Forty minutes .
C :  And how much time is left ?
A :  A minute or or ten maybe .
A :  M Yeah , ten or five .
C :  Ten minutes .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  So , we can uh
A :  redesign our uh
A :  Uh I would like to
C :  Well , I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box .
D :  And no added value .
C :  No , it's it's just the same product that is already on the market .
D :  At all . So
A :  Oh . Yeah .
B :  But you see the problem , y you can't continue your uh your line .
B :  Well , it's fluffy alright . Spongy .
