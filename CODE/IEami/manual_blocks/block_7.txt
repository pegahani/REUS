B :  Oops .
A :  So , hello everyone . We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control . I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov and okay let's begin .
A :  So
A :  I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting .
A :  So um we want to to do a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy and user friendly .
A :  Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design .
A :  and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day .
A :  Um , so let's try the whiteboard . Um so any of you who want to go .
D :  Wow .
B :  Yeah , for favourite animals . It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw . And it's gonna be you'll try to guess .
D :  Wow .
D :  Complex .
A :  Wow .
D :  Huh ?
D :  A cat .
C :  No .
B :  No .
D :  No . Darn .
D :  Uh .
A :  A rabbit .
B :  Yes , that's a rabbit . That's my favourite one .
D :  A what ?
A :  A rabbit .
D :  A r a rabbit , oh oh yeah , where is the carrot ? Okay mm-hmm .
C :  Rabbit .
B :  That's it .
A :  You want to go ?
D :  I am not very good at uh this kind of stuff . My favourite animal is
B :  Hmm .
C :  You wa
B :  Wow .
A :  A human ah .
D :  Guess . A human , yay . It's a very complex animal and um yeah . Characteristics of this this animal is dangerous .
B :  No .
A :  Mm I think you're supposed to , yeah .
C :  Is the white okay .
A :  Hmm .
C :  I guess you can .
B :  Wow . That's cobra .
D :  Ah , a kind of uh snake ? Cobra ? Exactly .
C :  Yeah uh not really . Small cobra .
B :  No , it just small cobra , yeah .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  Is that a worm ? Or
B :  It's co c quite recognisable .
D :  What about you uh Christa ?
A :  Uh yeah Christa Pavlov Mm .
C :  Chris .
B :  Christa Christa .
D :  A fish .
C :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Smiling fish .
C :  Smile fish .
B :  Okay .
D :  A smiling fish . Mm-hmm . So , w whiteboard is working ? Good . Next .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Next . Let's talk about money .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer . According to the drawings . Okay .
D :  Yeah , well .
C :  Yeah , you're
D :  Not me .
A :  So .
D :  So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control .
A :  Yeah , mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control . We aim to do this profit .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Okay .
D :  'tis big number .
B :  On the international market .
A :  Yeah . Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , we're to sell two million then .
B :  Wow .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum .
A :  'Kay .
A :  So any of you have experience in remote controls ?
D :  Uh yes , we have plenty at home . In fact , my daughter likes l remote controls . To eat ? Yeah , mainly , and to break .
C :  Mm yeah .
A :  That
B :  Mm . To eat ?
A :  So that could be a great um application . Remote controls children proof . Mm mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Yeah . Ye ye yeah .
B :  Children proof .
B :  Hmm .
D :  So she likes uh buttons which make click , so it has to click .
C :  Yeah , pret
A :  Okay .
A :  So they have to be waterproof maybe ? 'Cause they eat she ate it .
D :  It has to be uh wha baby proof yeah but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Ah .
D :  So it has to be very robust .
B :  Okay , unbreakable .
D :  Unbreakable , yeah .
C :  Yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah .
B :  Uh-huh .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And uh
D :  it has to be nice looking ,
C :  Yeah .
D :  colourful , maybe
A :  Colourful , yeah mm .
B :  Colourful ? That's not practical .
D :  colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control , they're always black , yeah , but this one could be I dunno , purple or b
C :  Yeah .
A :  No , that's a good idea .
C :  Yeah , it's always black or yeah .
A :  Mm mm-mm .
B :  No .
B :  But how gonna okay , just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  No , because you think , why not .
C :  Yeah .
D :  One colour .
B :  Otherwise you will never find it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah even we can change colours , no ? Like the uh like the phones and these things we c yeah . At least for children like one colour and .
D :  Oh like the phones , yeah , it could change colours , yeah .
B :  Cool .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Good .
A :  Good idea .
C :  And it should be really small and .
A :  Small also ? Don't you think
C :  Huh not so big like yeah .
A :  No uh , not too much buttons or mm .
C :  Yeah , not too much buttons and
D :  Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator whatever I dunno if it's
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's
D :  Or if we should have a targeted re remote control .
A :  Okay .
D :  So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , yeah , size matters , yeah .
A :  So , I think there's
C :  Yeah . Colour , size , sh
A :  So you you think it's better if small
A :  than bigger .
C :  Yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess .
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . Okay .
A :  No , not too small , yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah , like a palm sized .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  Just to hold it .
A :  Okay .
D :  But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if
C :  Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame . Mm . S so then it depends you are to
D :  Yeah , at least the colour would be different .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame .
D :  I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , I dunno .
A :  Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no .
B :  No , no screens , it's too complex .
A :  Okay .
D :  Too expensive for twelve Euro ?
C :  Mm . Too expensive , yeah .
B :  And n maybe not too expensive , well it's not my problem , but well okay . But no screens on remote controls .
A :  And too expensive .
D :  Ah .
D :  Mm-hmm . I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user .
A :  Mm .
D :  So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , if you if you like .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Ye yeah .
C :  Hmm .
C :  I mean it it's like it's like two types no ? people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on yeah .
D :  I don't know if it makes sense , but
A :  Mm-mm .
D :  Yeah , for instance , mm .
B :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm mm mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  So adaptable yeah something yeah .
B :  Adaptable . Alright , good , so how many actions do we need to implement in it ?
D :  Maybe , if if it's possible , yeah .
C :  Mm huh .
B :  On off ?
C :  Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working .
D :  Yeah .
C :  We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations .
B :  I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a
C :  Two .
D :  Three buttons you mean ?
B :  like three mental states , yeah you know what I mean , we can just make it uh
A :  Three option .
D :  Ah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
B :  controlled by a brain , huh ?
A :  Mm-hmm . Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside that ask you three
D :  Mm-hmm , yeah , sure .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D : 
A :  Hmm . If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may
A :  may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah .
B :  Sh sure , sure .
D :  Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time .
C :  Mm yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .
D :  Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five .
B :  Mm-hmm . You do this ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Uh no . Because I'm only using three or four channels but
B :  I usually just change channels .
C :  Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah , you can only have one bit .
A :  Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah .
C :  Dash .
D :  And then back to the one I was before , so there's whichever it was .
A :  Also we can be here yeah , that would be cool .
B :  Uh-huh . Go back button is good . I once had it .
C :  Yeah you can yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Uh uh we had that in in other countries . Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous .
C :  Yeah yeah , the previous button is .
A :  Mm yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh , okay .
B :  History .
C :  Oh uh .
D :  Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions , that becomes more complex , but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls . Yeah maybe it's a
C :  Uh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah , what the which channels the viewer
A :  Mm-mm .
A :  Okay . So I think we have full of idea .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm
A :  work on these ideas and try to make a
A :  uh the ones , make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want .
A :  And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do .
A :  Um .
A :  So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes .
D :  So what does M_E_ means ? M_E_ the user requirements ? Or that's uh that's for us ?
B :  Market Expert .
C :  Marketing yeah .
D :  Uh that's me . Oh , of course yeah , the user requirement specifications , uh-huh , yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay . I'll think of that .
A :  Mm okay .
A :  So .
D :  So ?
A :  I think that's all .
D :  Meeting's over ? Great .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Thank you .
D :  Thank you .
B :  Thank you everybody .
A :  See you in thirty minutes .
D :  So
A :  I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .
D :  Of course .
A :  Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation .
A :  Um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um
A :  third part uh I don't remember which is not very good .
A :  Ah of course , how to to design this uh this yeah .
D :  Nice stuff
A :  um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .
D :  Who starts ?
D :  Oh . Ha . okay . So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ?
A :  So wait a minute . Mm .
D :  So it's being modified . Do you want yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . So , um yeah , this is my name .
B :  Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh . We met before .
A :  Sounds uh
D :  So as you know , you I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please .
D :  Uh-oh .
A :  Mm uh .
C :  Yeah , it is put F_ five .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Hmm .
C :  The full page presentation , yep .
D :  Yeah maybe in the full page because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .
B :  F_ F_ five .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . Yep .
A :  F_ five .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Uh-huh hmm okay .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm .
D :  So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful .
D :  Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey .
D :  And next please .
D :  Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls .
D :  First of all , they find it very ugly . Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking .
D :  Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um .
D :  And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls .
D :  For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another .
D :  And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using .
D :  Um next please . Now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance uh they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please , where are you ? Like uh something to to like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your your remote control . But why not ? Yeah .
B :  Agree .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  You can you are .
A :  Why not ?
D :  And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls .
C :  Hmm .
D :  And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ . So I think they are bad . Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my
A :  Okay uh tha that's look great .
B :  R_S_I_ mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .
D :  Oh , okay , I think it's a technical thing which our
B :  No , I don't think so .
C :  Yeah , because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , and those waves have high
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay . But twenty six percent , do you know
D :  So , it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know but we have to take this into account .
A :  Or something we don't know . Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh .
B :  Twenty five .
C :  Uh .
B :  Every fourth , you know . Every four some of us knows .
C :  Yeah it's
C :  People really
D :  So anyway that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um
A :  Okay .
B :  One of us
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  what else do I have ? Next slide ?
D :  Ah yeah . So we've listed a couple of uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Functions .
D :  s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant .
D :  People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant .
D :  Ah now I remember what is R_S_I_ it's repetitivity stress injury .
D :  We have to be careful with that word but uh anyway I continue my presentation so yeah , channel selection is um very important , very often used .
C :  Uh .
D :  Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings .
D :  All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .
A :  I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .
D :  I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were had I think ten I think .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two . Not very relevant , so
C :  Hmm .
D :  if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think net next slide .
D :  One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want .
D :  So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant .
D :  And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down . So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider .
C :  Yeah .
C :  'Cause
D :  If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so now this is of course , depends on that .
A :  Mm-mm . Okay .
D :  And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?
A :  Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review .
B :  I got one question , uh you are a Market Expert so should we aim at the young people or not ?
D :  I can go back . Yeah one question , yeah ?
C :  Thank you .
D :  I am .
D :  I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device . In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than more than
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay , then teletext is used less .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Then teletext is useless for them I think , yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah . But yeah . Nope .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay . That's good point .
C :  Mm , yep .
B :  Mm . Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  'Kay ?
C :  Thank you .
A :  So um now I think it's the turn of the
A :  the I'm not sure um
A :  Of the technical function , so
A :  uh
D :  So I think it's you , huh ?
C :  Uh it's
D :  No ?
B :  That's me .
C :  techni function of
A :  what effect
D :  No , user requiremen
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Wait a second . Argh .
C :  I have to do working design so uh .
B :  That's but this but number three , yes .
A :  So you're
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design . However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design .
B :  Uh , as I'm a more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . So next slide please .
A :  Okay . Let's go .
B :  And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .
C :  Mm .
B :  'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .
D :  Makes sense .
B :  So , make a click , please .
B :  So here is this remote control .
B :  It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much
B :  easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily .
B :  Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one
C :  It's
B :  which one would you prefer ? I guess this .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .
B :  Sure , sure .
C :  Yeah . Maybe it can be yeah middle of like , between those two li
B :  Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple
A :  Oh sorry .
B :  simple desires into simple actions .
D :  Nice . Nice sentence .
B :  Findings .
A :  Okay . Oh sorry .
B :  Our question of the style , we should remember that our company
B :  puts fashion into electronics
B :  and we should never forget about it .
B :  Concept . Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market . Market is a of remote controls you know it better , it's very
C :  S you should yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  well , it's
B :  it's not an easy field to to play , you know ?
B :  So be simple . For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .
B :  It's a really good style , it going to be look like like this .
B :  It is unbreakable and it is very universal .
B :  W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours ,
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen .
B :  And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So
B :  Press
B :  I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium
C :  Mm .
B :  I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume .
B :  And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic .
B :  When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ ,
D :  Hmm .
A :  It's off . It's on .
B :  the T_V_ turns on .
D :  And when does it turn off ?
B :  When you don't touch the control but you go out of the
D :  Oh so you have a
B :  For for enough time like uh you
D :  sensing sensor machine that uh knows
B :  It's a question to our technical design , our two engineers . And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you .
C : 
D :  Tech
B :  Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .
A :  Or you want to go to the kitchen .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It's easy to do , you just control the
D :  According to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .
C :  Distance .
B :  According to the distance . Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?
B :  So
B :  I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .
D :  So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So , its main purpose in fact is a back light , which change colours , which makes it easier to find ,
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
B :  and each can it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ?
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
B :  So basically that's it .
A :  Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .
B :  Can be easily done , 'cause
A :  Yeah .
B :  you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions . Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Just few actions , a few actions for everything . All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .
C :  Mm .
A :  Hmm . S
A :  Mm .
A :  Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah .
C :  Mm . Yeah and it mm .
B :  Okay , okay .
B :  Okay , but it's quite universal you know .
C :  Mm .
B :  We can just extend it to any device .
C :  Mm .
D :  So for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would I do can I do that with this ?
B :  Uh twenty five .
D :  Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels , that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . Or is it ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  In fact I would propose another solution . Basically you use just four or five channels , right ? Yeah . So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .
D :  Most people yeah .
D :  In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button . I uh
A :  Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  B yeah .
C :  But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number and then it go t because
D :  Go to channel twenty five . One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But still
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And it's only next . Yeah so but you have to
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next . Or say this can be back .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah. .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then
D :  So it would be
D :  Okay .
A :  Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm . Alright . Listening more .
A :  uh current chan
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls so we can have more functions for T_V_ uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?
D :  Well I could could uh have a look at that maybe . I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Although I don't know .
B :  Alright ? Thanks for your attention .
A :  Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now the technical aspects of this new device .
A :  Mm .
C :  Two .
C :  Yeah , if
C :  Sorry . Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators . So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control .
A :  You prefer it .
C :  Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera .
C :  So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ .
C :  So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device .
C :  And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that .
C :  And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device .
C :  It's generally in the form of infrared or
C :  some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want .
C :  So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control we need few components , mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want ,
C :  and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format .
C :  And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device .
C :  Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .
C :  Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
C :  So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes .
A :  Okay .
C :  Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device .
C :  Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface , so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , so we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just yeah , so that we just use simple recog no but but
A :  On
A :  Uh train it , okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Too complex .
D :  But uh very very good to sell .
C :  Yeah . No , even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .
D :  Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , and ha ha you cannot use my remote control , because it's targeted to me . Whatever .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . And what about the price of this component ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  So
C :  Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that , because we want to have uh millions and in bulk , so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like then we'll have something like this um
A :  It mm okay .
D :  Hmm . Cheap .
D :  Millions .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  Cheap .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  we'll have volume
C :  and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .
D :  The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume , up , down .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  With a keywords and yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Couple of words .
A :  Mm-hmm mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Um .
C :  And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number , we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else because
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Of course uh it has to be
C :  it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , it's it it will be take care of our main mm .
D :  Okay .
B :  No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , and and he's coming you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down .
D :  But then I think you
D :  you
D :  First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . It's on top of using the button .
A :  No , in no not only speech , yeah .
B :  Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros .
A :  I it's an option .
D :  Well , I dunno .
C :  Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this processor and
C :  This really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key .
C :  So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control so and we have only few things here
B :  Okay. .
D :  T_V_ .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
A :  Sho to to train , okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ? Like , if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like
C :  Um uh uh this point we didn't consider because it's it's very expensive because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros and
B :  roll 'em up or roll 'em down .
A :  Mm .
D :  Very expensive , no ?
A :  And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .
B :  Mm why ? That's just
C :  Yeah , even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off and
D :  And volume control .
D :  So but uh
D :  Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .
C :  Yay yeah .
C :  Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I
D :  Hmm .
A :  Wouldn't that make uh arguments ? I want uh
C :  They can make
D :  Yeah , of course . That's no problem , we will sell more . Yeah exactly .
C :  Yeah we can have
A :  And we can increase this the strength y you can buy one with
B :  We got a really good Market Expert . Let's send more , let's sell more .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .
C :  Uh , not very much , like yeah .
A :  No .
D :  Okay . Thanks .
A :  Okay , thanks .
C :  Thank you . Yep .
C :  Thank you .
A :  So
C :  Can you just yeah .
A :  mm I think , okay , we're just on time .
A :  Um mm mm .
A :  So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .
D :  Mm great .
A :  Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um
A :  we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to
A :  to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so
A :  uh
A :  you will focus on the component concept um
C :  Yeah yeah .
A :  uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching .
C :  Mark will
A :  So um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach .
A :  Well I think that's all .
A :  And we have um maybe we have to we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .
C :  Uh it's in current price , yeah .
D :  Difficult .
A :  Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But speech recogniser can be possible .
A :  Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And um
A :  do you see something else ?
D :  No .
B :  Uh , should it be equipped with the
B :  uh , with uh speakers ?
D :  Speakers in the remote cont
B :  Like , you want to find it , you shout
D :  Oh yeah .
A :  Uh yeah that's
B :  control , and it answers is I'm here ? Or
D :  It just beeps . That would be enough . Something very cheap .
B :  Just beeps ?
A :  Or maybe you want to phone him .
D :  But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .
C :  Yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Since now all yeah ?
C :  Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes because it should be all the time on and
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . You can't whistle . Uh-huh . Or a clap .
A :  And uh
A :  And it's answered .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .
B :  Mm .
D :  You can clap . Can you ? Clap is good . Tak
A :  Clap clap clap it's a good I I think it's universal .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Just a suggestion . With only one hand ? These are not our target people .
B :  Okay .
A :  What about people without hand ? Yeah .
C :  Yeah I think it's good .
A :  Mm uh okay .
C :  But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh that's e that already exists okay okay . Oh yeah , you do have . Wow . You're trendy .
C :  Oh .
B :  Yeah , I got it at my home , like . Oops .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Ah it's
A :  Mm-hmm , so let's to think s so that yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .
D :  Think about it . Yeah , okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  It yes .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Good we're done ? Right , thanks .
A :  So , yeah , let's go to lunch .
C :  Yeah . Thank you , thank you very much .
A :  Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh y getting close to the last is the penultim meeting .
B :  How was lunch ?
D :  Thanks Don't be sarcastic . Mark .
A :  Mm great .
A :  So um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy . Um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .
D :  Uh Rama .
C :  Ramaro .
B :  Mm .
A :  So what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing . It's
A :  So , let's go . First
A :  with Rama .
A :  Participant two .
C :  Yeah , participant two .
C :  Component .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yep .
C :  So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then uh titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some , moving kind of thing .
D :  Ah .
C :  So , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control .
C :  So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .
A :  Mm-hmm , okay .
C :  So uh we discussed an
C :  Excuse me .
C :  So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  What is a double-curved shape ?
C :  Like you can have two curves .
D :  Uh-huh .
B :  Why ?
C :  Uh it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic .
C :  So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .
D :  The cost .
C :  Uh
C :  Uh
C :  And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and
A :  Okay . You m titanium it's more uh
C :  Yeah .
B :  W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know
D :  Mm like this ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yes so mm
C :  Like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and yeah . But full assembly
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay .
C :  We'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . And this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh yeah so
A :  Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .
C :  S S
D :  Speech
C :  Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , so
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay , and still we have mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ .
D :  L_C_D_ .
C :  Uh l
D :  Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button .
C :  So uh it's like a
B :  No , it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus .
D :  Ah .
C :  Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter
B :  Okay , so let's try it , let's t
D :  The L_C_D_ would
D :  The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . Just uh for output , yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that can we we can consider , because like it won't take much money I guess , because
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  Okay , yep . You have any further questions or ?
A :  Mm .
D :  I guess no um . So the batteries uh are going to be very light .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
C :  really light batteries and with uh good price .
D :  So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be ask .
C :  Yeah , that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology and so
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , for the location .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah , if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  So let's now go to the you don't have more question ? Um mm thank you mm .
D :  No , it's okay . Puts less of constraint on what we can do but
B :  No more questions .
C :  Yep . Thank you .
B :  Mm yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  it's always like that . We have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible .
A :  Yeah , but mm .
C :  Oh . We have uh some limitations .
D :  Anyway .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice , L_C_ I'm an artist , sorry . So uh , that's not I hope that's not too much . Okay . Uh participant number three .
D :  L_C_D_ . L_S_D_ is something else , and it's quite nice as well . So , go on uh artist .
A :  Okay . Um yeah . Now let's talk about uh interface .
A :  Three .
C :  Three .
B :  Uh
A :  Which one ?
D :  Hmm .
B :  mm uh have a look at this no it's yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh so the concept of the interface . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for
B :  possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let's start with this . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here
D : 
B :  and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I don't remember so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no ? I can see nothing . So that's our concept . It's called the millennium remote control .
A :  Mm .
D :  Let's change millenniums .
C :  So maybe you can use in the end and
B :  Yeah .
D :  doesn't make sense . This is very ugly .
B :  Really ? I thought you like it . Ah okay just press the button , please uh .
D :  Oh no , too much concept .
D :  Ah .
A :  No .
D : 
C :  Uh
B :  Yeah , we will not use this . We will not use this . But instead of this I will devise That's our concept .
D :  Ah , back today .
B :  And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already
B :  we already discussed . And uh what will people say ?
A :  Mm-hmm . 'Kay .
B :  They'll say it's perfect . Or what will say ? Uh they will say it's splendid . And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it . And everyone's gonna be satisfied .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Do you think it can come in several colours ?
D :  Or did the
B :  I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours .
D :  Um but not the case .
B :  Not the case .
D :  Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , like
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ?
D :  Yeah , well they like uh something which is uh
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels .
D :  Mm yeah , okay , so that would be the option . I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone , but
B :  Do you like it ?
C :  But it's uh
D :  I don't use that but again , uh I might
B :  That's why you don't have it . That's why , 'cause it's nasty .
D :  Yeah , bu but
C :  But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ .
B :  No .
C :  Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  uh the shapes and they can have different assembly .
B :  Um , I am here .
C :  So users have different I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so
A :  Okay .
A :  So ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So we can just if they want they can just pay another
A :  Uh-huh , okay , so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_ , yeah .
B :  'Kay .
C :  two Euro .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah yes . If they want like uh so that we can yeah .
D :  Kind of upgradable uh remote control . Wow , wow .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Just they'll get few more
C :  things and few more colours .
B :  Okay , what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours
C :  Lights , yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  And thermodynamic also . Mm-hmm .
B :  depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Like a chameleon .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah yeah .
B :  We can make it in fact . If if if the okay .
A :  Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah . But uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version , but
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , so
C :  Yeah .
D :  Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . Those for which the remote control is uh
D :  is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature . My remote control is pink . Nobody else than me has a pink remote control . And that makes me special .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is
D :  I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that .
A :  Okay , so
D :  Those who wanted to have it pink .
A :  so i it's not uh a s base service it's a
C :  Uh
D :  No mm no .
C :  Mm .
B :  So , be an option , yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  It might be optional , yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  But those people will be really few , no ? So like we can those
D :  The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink
C :  Ah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So m so maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base .
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time .
D :  Mm . Yeah .
A :  And you'll be different . Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . Want to change my neighbour .
D :  Yeah , yeah . You always have your remote . Oh , you don't ? Yeah . You don't have your remo
B :  And it makes you different , you know ? Anyone has their remote controls here ? No ?
D :  Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control . Uh it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere . It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Uh-huh , uh-huh . Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Seems important .
C :  Hmm .
B :  That they can use it in darkness , like .
D :  Mm glow in the dark , so
B :  Hand light , yeah .
C :  Yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  radium chips or something so that like at least um yeah . Yeah , that
A :  Iradium ? Ah sorry . Mm .
B :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay . S well , let's go on maybe with the presentation . And um the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?
A :  So mm
D :  Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Oh .
B :  And uh
B :  I dunno that's a question to you and to mm to
D :  Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing . Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay , okay .
D :  I dunno .
A :  Mm , that's a nice world .
B :  So just just just just think about it um .
B :  Thank you .
D :  Don't touch the remote . But yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want . Like with some
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart .
D :  Maybe fingerprint recognition or
B :  Voice recognition is quite tough . I say don't use it , and the control just looks .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um
B :  'Cause I ordered jus
D :  Mm .
B :  To l to l lock it .
C :  Uh that mm that could be feasible I guess , like
D :  Okay .
C :  So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah .
D :  So it could be
D :  smart in that way .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , I dunno , that might be expensive but
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , sure .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh it's
D :  that might also be a good sales pitch again . The remote that knows you .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay , thanks .
A :  So it's yeah , Marketing Expert .
D :  My turn ?
D :  Okay , it's alright .
A :  Participant two ? Four , sorry .
C :  Four .
D :  Four , I think . Trend , yeah .
D :  No uh yes .
D :  Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to
D :  to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired .
D :  Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you're not following the trend , you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . So anyway uh next slide please .
D :  Uh to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy .
D :  Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours .
D :  And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . Next slide please .
A :  Mm .
D :  Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel or so . And I think of course uh i it applies to everything . That's the thing with trends . It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea . Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , yeah . Well this so so I think uh uh i
C : 
A : 
C :  Mm .
B :  What is spongy ?
C :  Yeah kind of um maybe
D :  When we were talking about rubber , I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .
C :  Yeah it
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So maybe titanium it's not a good idea .
D :  Seems not , seems not .
C :  We need to think about mm mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So
A :  Um sorry Mark . It seems to be
D :  Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh
C :  Fruit .
C :  Even shape ?
C :  More yeah .
D :  more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean
A :  Mm-mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
D :  So that's what people seem to yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought but that's that's fashion and
A :  Hmm . You're old-fashioned . Sorry .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay that's all I have to say .
A :  Mm you have questions ?
C :  So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it's
D :  These I'm sorry .
C :  This you you so did you
D :  Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends that are also well .
C :  Where ?
C :  Oh . Oh , okay , mm-hmm . It's not from mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . It's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control .
D :  No , it's not it's not this this is very general , yeah . But it seems that trends travel across things . The what we
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah but some materials n they're to be
C :  uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or yeah yeah .
D :  Sure . Yeah . We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside , so of course . This is your problem . This is not mine .
C :  yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that's
C :  Yeah yeah that yeah yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , looking yeah fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . We can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay ?
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  No more question ?
A :  Okay .
D :  Yep . Thanks .
A :  So
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design , um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay .
C :  Look and feel de
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Mm sounds interesting .
A :  Mm-hmm um
A :  and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Thanks .
C :  So , can we highlight the specific features of our yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend .
A :  Yeah you're right , you have to
A :  So you say s
D :  Spongy .
A :  S do we agree on that ? Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  We have to .
C :  So , do you think
D :  No , we don't have to , but seems it's the trend . Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . So there's no
B :  So we have to uh for
A :  No .
C :  Hmm . Yeah .
B :  yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Well , that's you t can try to convince us .
B :  Well , we can make it smell like fruit . Yeah .
D :  Okay . that's a good idea , I
A :  Okay , that's a good idea . So titanium smell like fruit . Mm-hmm .
C :  That's
C :  So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? Or they really like
D :  Uh
C :  They more want these fancy features like
D :  I think i yeah i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us because we have it and others don't . It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Feature
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I I agree with uh this uh
C :  Yeah .
A :  Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy
A :  uh fruity-like
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah .
D :  Maybe you could explore the two option .
A :  Mm . Yeah , yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ?
C :  Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or
B :  I mean fruit-shaped .
A :  Don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape yeah .
B :  But
B :  Doub double-curved .
D :  Mm . Seems to be .
C :  yeah it's it's yeah that's a we're to look for and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive and d
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  Okay , okay .
B :  In fact I just agreed to make uh
B :  to make the like titanium panels
B :  on a whole
B :  rubber body .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Well , okay w we'll see .
A :  Mm-mm . Okay , so you explore now that you're going to work together these these two . Or or spongy an yeah .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or
A :  Mm .
B :  We'll see . We'll see .
D :  If you have time .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose .
A :  If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it cannot be both .
C :  Uh .
B :  We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for I dunno uh yeah um we'll look .
C :  Yeah .
D :  For creation .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium .
C :  Even design .
D :  You can paint it afterward . No problem . We have a very large department of paint . You will do it .
B :  Okay , okay .
A :  Yeah , do don't worry , you you you speak with mm mm .
B :  Alright , alright .
A :  Okay . So explore a shape .
C :  So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or
A :  Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information . Not uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , then we can
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  yeah , yeah , that user friendly or
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  That's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or yeah yeah j yeah , because
D :  Yeah . Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel . Anyway it's very in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control . So . Because the trend goes faster than the life of the
A :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So it's very
A :  Okay .
A :  So are we mm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  We're done .
C :  Yeah , we're done .
A :  Okay . So see you in thirty minutes .
C :  Yep .
A :  Mm .
D :  So , Hi Christa .
A :  So , uh now it's the Hi Sammy . It's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . Then , w we
D :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
A :  And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . And that's all . Okay . So first , let's uh
B :  And chocolate ?
D :  Mm .
A :  see the prototype .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , here we have our prototype model .
A :  Okay . And you have some slides then ? Yeah . Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides .
B :  Yes , and place some slides .
A :  Okay . Uh so in which uh
C :  In
B :  Uh , participant three .
B :  Prototype .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm okay . Mm .
C :  Five .
B :  Uh , so
C :  Him .
B :  this is our
B :  remote control .
B :  It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications . That's well , so that's that . Please , next slide .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA , and uh made some real good Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that . And um ,
A :  MASA ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  s society will accept that . For sure .
B :  And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide .
B :  But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m
B :  the modern material we can p select .
B :  And it's practical .
B :  And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something .
B :  And as I said , it's perfect .
C :  .
A :  Okay .
B :  Please press it . Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an
C :  Experience . Explanat
D :  Such a nice thing .
B :  s such a r such a device . So you can touch it with your hands . Sure . Yes .
C :  See this .
D :  Can I ? Ho-ho .
C :  You can
D : 
A :  What do you say ?
D :  It says
B :  You must say it .
C :  Spongy .
D :  I will uh
A :  One day . He
D :  I'll buy it . If I if I need so . Hopefully my daughter will like it .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course . , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and
D :  Yes , of course . Of c course .
D :  Ah .
B :  That's all I wanted to say . Now it's technical specification by our
C :  Hmm .
B :  colleague .
A :  Hmm .
C :  So
D :  Oh , there is a button missing . Okay . It's in option .
C :  Yeah . This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons . Yeah . So function , mm
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .
C :  And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button . And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . And it can also do the action .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Hmm .
C :  And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control . Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby . And then , it will say hi .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Hey , babe . Bob . Hey Bob .
A :  Bobby . Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , hi , and then you can use it .
D :  Okay , that's good .
A :  Hmm . 'Kay .
C :  So , um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can have And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches .
A : 
D :  Oh , these are strawberries .
A :  Are colourful . Yeah .
C :  Material , we want to stick to titanium .
C :  We will send , we want to
D :  Fruit smelling spongy titanium . I didn't know it exist , but that's great .
A : 
C :  Yeah , or s
C :  So , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .
D :  Ha .
A :  Ho-ho .
D :  You mean we can change the colour uh of th
A :  That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ?
C :  For the L_C_D_ .
D :  Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ .
C :  With titanium it's it is silver . Yeah .
D :  Tit titanium is
B :  We are still working on titanium . So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ . You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday .
A :  Mm-mm .
D :  Uh , okay .
C :  Mm , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , Bob , please . Tuesday colour .
A :  Hey , you know you're theme today .
C :  Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or s
D :  Okay .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Black for Sunday .
C :  And you can have many colours on weekends . Or
A :  And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ?
D :  On the L_C_D_ ? Oh .
C :  Huh ?
A :  Wh wh
C :  Ah , these are like sensors .
D :  Of course . What do you think ? Strawberry sensors .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  That's location sensors .
D :  Very useful .
A :  Okay . Strawberries .
C :  So , after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for
A :  Ah .
D :  Lounge meeting .
C :  So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know .
B :  Yeah , and we can just some strawberry first . Um
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright . Good .
A :  Okay . Mm-hmm .
B :  Oops .
D :  So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm .
C :  So , any specific questions for
A :  Uh we'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into
D :  It makes sense .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Let's make a party first maybe .
C :  Yeah . Then we can discuss We can
A :  W
A :  Who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in ?
C :  Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left .
D :  So uh , this is
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay . Uh , so
D :  What a design .
D :  It's my turn . Mm-hmm . Let's see if this Yeah , if you meet
A :  Let's uh , yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium .
C :  Yeah .
D :  the evaluation criterion .
A :  Oops .
C :  Fudge .
D :  Yeah . So , evaluation please .
D :  So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that . So mm
D :  Uh , next slide , please .
D :  As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can .
C :  Yeah .
D :  To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . And we're all l going to list all the criterion . I'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ?
A :  Okay .
C :  Fancy .
D :  So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  from one to seven
D :  with four in the middle .
C :  Huh .
D :  So ,
C :  Yeah , what's is really
D :  what do you think , is it fancy ?
C :  Uh , it's really
A :  Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy .
D :  It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ?
A :  Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . Uh what do you think ?
D :  Yeah , of course . What do you think ?
B :  Feel the weight .
D :  Is it
D :  The weight is later . Now we're We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy .
C :  Yeah . Oh .
B :  Really .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , yeah . We can give at least five or six , seven .
D :  It's uh
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , so No it's it's one . Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . So it's one or two . What do you think ? Two ? Okay . So here , two . Up . Then we have uh technology .
A :  It's in the other . Yeah .
C :  Oh , Oh . So Oh , okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So
A :  Two . Let's say two , yeah .
C :  M maybe two .
B :  Two . Two .
C :  Technology .
C :  Yeah . Um
D :  So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based , we have L_C_D_ .
C :  And we have L_C_D_ .
C :  So you change colours .
A :  Change colour of t
D :  Change colour , I mean that's very
C :  Useful .
A :  Yeah , I think it's a
D :  Quite d I think it's a one for that , at least . At least a one , yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Uh
C :  Yeah , yeah . It's silly .
A :  Mm-mm .
D :  Robustness , uh-huh .
C :  Uh , still we need to cha
D :  So let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away . Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype . Let's try .
A : 
A :  Um
A :  The strawberries Oh .
C :  Yeah , it Maybe strawberry .
D :  Oh my god . Okay , we just lost one strawberry . So Not at all ?
B :  No . No . How can I say this . It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . A strawberry .
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah , we can easily plug it .
D :  It is
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  So it's not so bad . I um uh I would say three .
A :  Mm-mm .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah . But it's too . It's um robust , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ?
C :  Useful ?
D :  Useful . Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? So I don't know . These buttons are uh It not clear . But you have at least uh next produce .
C :  Yeah ,
A :  Oh , yeah , lets me try .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  What is uh next , please ?
C :  Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main
D :  Uh , it depends on the Okay .
A :  And you can uh do di two sites ? Yeah .
C :  You
C :  Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . So if you don't want
A :  Okay , also .
D :  So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly .
C :  Yeah , um yeah .
A :  You can , by using the
C :  Yeah .
B :  You can .
D :  Directly .
B :  You go you So , the basic mode Yeah . So that's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down . And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this .
A :  You c push here the the yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Oh , it's a jog dial , okay .
D :  Uh-huh .
C :  And channel .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  You can select .
B :  You select twenty , you select five . That's it .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah mm .
D :  It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? Don't you think so ? May not okay , we can go . That's uh You're right .
B :  No .
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah .
D :  That's it's less uh Yeah . But it's it's nice , because people anyway don't go there . But
C :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm .
D :  So what do you think for it , usefulness ? Seems to be useful .
C :  So , d Yeah , we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So
A :  Let me understand well , because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . Yeah , two
C :  so
D :  Both .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Up down or left right . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Up .
A :  Yeah . And which what is that ?
D :  That
B :  It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . Like , selecting the menus .
C :  This is jog wheel .
A :  Okay , okay . It's a kind Oh , okay okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Um , see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one .
D :  Cool .
A :  Oh oh okay , great .
D :  I would say then uh
A :  Now it's looks us useful . Yeah .
D :  Two or three ? Two or three ? Two .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Two , maybe .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , two .
D :  So size and weight .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or Because it Size is going to be that , yeah ?
C :  Yeah , it's size al almost
C :  Yeah , because it is The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium . Yeah .
D :  Uh , and and
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  Sure , without titanium alloy , it's going to be light .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  It's going to be lighter , because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , for my daughter , for instance . Not sure if uh she can use it .
B :  Of course .
C :  Heavy . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But sides uh , the sides should be okay . . Yeah mm .
D :  So , should be okay .
D :  Up to three for that , because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh Colour and shape .
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Oh .
A :  Uh-oh .
D :  Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case . It's a it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . That's nice . I think it's good . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  The case is silver titanium , no ?
A :  Yeah , it's .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Let's imagine .
A :  And what about the strawberries on the top ? I'm not convince . But maybe I'm not trendy . But , uh
D :  Yahoo .
D :  Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . So
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but uh uh they're not useful . I I mean it that's uh
C :  So maybe , I think
D :  Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . Whether it's fancy or not now , it we have to decide . But this If it's
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah , well
C :  Yeah . Um
A :  Hmm .
A :  I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful .
D :  Uh-huh . So , that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead .
A :  Yeah .
D :  .
C :  Yeah , well then it's bit difficult to use . Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . So it's Even
A :  Mm-hmm . But the n Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh
C :  These buttons
A :  No , I'm not sure uh why uh if it was like this
C :  But it looks really not really good . I mean , the f Yeah . So these are kind of rubber things . Even if you lose one you can just put whatever . Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and
D : 
A :  It's n no , it's not fancy any more .
A :  Okay .
B :  And
A :  Uh-huh . And different routes . Okay , I see what
B :  Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded , but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here , so we just Yeah , so even if you don't put , it works . But this is really fancy .
A :  Also .
A :  Okay .
D :  I suggested three . Because uh , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince , although it's quite You have good arguments . But
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  And uh the last one is adaptive . This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Sure , sure , just look at it .
D :  Great . Fully adaptable . That's Yeah . So you can fit into your palm , okay . That What else can we need ? You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ?
B :  It's full adaptable .
A :  Wow , that's a
B :  Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know .
C :  Yeah . You can Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it's fudge titanium . You know . Right , yeah . And uh
D :  It's fudge , yeah , yeah . Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . Well , I if if this is if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one .
B :  Mm ,
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Let's go for one .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Now we have to do the average .
C :  Three , three , six , eight , eleven .
D :  Who is good in math ?
B :  It's two point one seven .
D :  Okay . Two point one seven . That's nice . Two point one seven out of seven . I think we have a good
C :  Hmm .
C :  .
A :  Yeah .
D :  good thing . Well , that's all I had to say about the evaluation . So
A :  So it's a good evaluation .
D :  It seems to be good , yeah . We have uh
A :  Yeah . Mm .
C :  Yeah mm . Yeah , two one one seven , we have . So
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-mm .
D :  Yeah . Okay . Thanks .
A :  Okay . So now , it has to fulfil the financial criterium ?
D :  Ah-ha .
A :  So , I have an Here . Um
A :  .
D : 
A : 
C :  Energy . Uh , we use bat
D :  So so how many batteries do we need ? One battery ?
C :  One battery . Yep .
A :  Okay , so two .
D :  Good .
D :  Why two ?
C :  Oh , we just need one , I guess .
D :  Say no . No , ne never install .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Two batteries or one ?
A :  Oh .
C :  No , number is one . We need only one battery .
D :  Only one .
A :  Yeah yeah , but the price is two . Oh , number . Sorry sorry sorry . I'm sorry .
D :  No , no . But no , no . No , no way .
B :  No , uh you just Number . Yeah .
C :  Number , number .
D :  Yeah . You never use uh Excel ? Good .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Oh .
A :  No , never .
B :  How What what's the limit ?
A :  H
D :  It's twelve bucks .
B :  Uh , it's it's okay that I don't know , 'cause uh it's not my field . Twelve bucks . Okay , now Mm-hmm . Check that number also .
D :  Twelve bucks . Twelve and a half , I think .
C :  So we
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay , electronics . So
C :  We have sample chip . Uh , like simple chip , yeah . So , yeah . Yeah . Four buttons at least . And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition .
D :  It's a simple chip ? Simple chip , okay . One .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  And for the
A :  One also .
D :  One or two ? One ? Okay .
C :  Yeah , one to one . Yeah , one .
D :  So the case , which one uh is it in the end ?
C :  Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve , no ?
D :  Let's do a single curve .
C :  Oh , is
B :  It's it's flat .
D :  It's flat , and curved .
C :  Oh . Oh , okay .
A :  I thought you can curve somebody .
B :  It's flat .
B :  But it is flat , you Look . It's curvable , but it's not curved .
D :  It's curvable .
D :  Maybe there is a supplement for that , no ? It's only curve ? Okay , let's go .
A :  Mm-hmm . Oh see , I I think that the the price is this one .
C :  Yeah .
D :  This Okay , you d We tried , we tried .
A :  Yeah , yeah . Don't chip on me .
C : 
C :  Oh .
B :  Oh , okay .
D :  So , what is it ? T titanium ? Mm , that's expensive . Mm-hmm .
C :  Titanium .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . But she wanted u the fudge titanium . I think it's five , but you don't say .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , well
D :  Let's stick to s titan . Special colour ? No because uh
B :  Well , n Why three ? Why three ?
C :  No , only one , no ?
A :  Mm .
A :  Oh , sorry . Again , I'm See it .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Um
A :  Special colour , or it's only on the
C :  Interface .
D :  Oh .
C :  Yes , in L_C_D_ display . Ok
A :  Yeah , but there is no colour here . So I put it here .
C :  Yeah , an Yeah .
C :  Push-button .
D :  So the L_C_D_
A :  How many push-button ? Three or two ?
C :  Uh , two .
D :  Two .
A :  Is there The scroll-wheel , okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  It's going to be expensive .
C :  One scroll wheel . One L_C_D_
C :  displayed .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um
D :  That's all ? No .
A :  That's that's not We choose this one , and not this one .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Oh , I think , no it's Uh , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ? Or only only scroll wheel , okay .
C :  Yeah , it's cheaper .
A :  Or only a scroll-wheel .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Only scroll wheel . Yeah mm .
C :  So
D :  You are trying to make make up make us up .
A :  You try to s No , no , no . Because how do you do to y select ?
C :  It's already
D :  No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons , no ?
C :  Ah .
C :  Y ye
A :  Yeah , I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you
D :  That's true .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes . And it will activate Um , plus , yeah , it's price is really
D :  Yeah .
A :  Stay longer . Okay . Oops . Okay , okay . Um
D :  It should stay . Yeah .
C :  Special colours , yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  For buttons .
C :  Yeah , buttons and strawberries . Yeah .
B :  No , buttons just normal .
C :  Special form .
A :  You you have all of these , no ?
D :  She's very hard on this . Special colour ?
A :  Mm maybe n not this one but
D :  Yeah . No . Special material ?
C :  Uh , we have titan
B :  That's for buttons . But buttons are standard .
D :  Yeah , buttons are the standard buttons . Yeah . It's only buttons , these .
A :  Yeah , so
D :  Nothing special . Okay . So we are at seventeen dot eight .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Not special colours an interest in ?
D :  No , the colour is in the L_C_D_ .
A :  And buttons are not colourised ?
D :  I no .
A :  They are m
C :  Mm , hmm , I think uh because you can just go for a good colours . Yeah , and uh
D :  We can just use this red . It's
A :  Boo-hoo . It's already too expensive . Apparently .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So what is Are we supposed to cut things out now ? Uh , until we get twelve fifty .
A :  Yeah . Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm .
C :  Oh .
A :  So think of what we can cut uh here .
D :  Well ,
D :  if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker .
C :  Sample speaker . Yeah .
A :  Apparently , we have to choose one or the other .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Well , as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy .
B :  So , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy
A :  But you don't need a battery ? Mm .
B :  to make electricity . Yeah , that you don't need a battery . So , it's something like hand dynamo robot .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  A real high-tech version of it .
A :  But um it's like the hand dynamo , no ?
D :  So that would
C :  Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand
D :  So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , we only We we win one . That's already that . Okay , let's do that .
C :  is
B :  Okay , but l
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uh it's a it's a beginning . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Why not . Let's do that .
A :  So
C :  Yeah , just remo
A :  One here and here .
A :  'Kay .
B :  And I propose to So uh , about chips . Advanced chip on print , right ? So , put minus one there , please .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I'm not sure if this is legal .
A :  Mm . That's right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Why not ?
C :  Uh , no .
B :  And ?
D :  And ?
A :  M maybe minus uh three , no ?
D :  No . Okay , let's see .
C :  Yeah .
C :  No , no . It's not
B :  So , was there result ? Let's have a look .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm .
C :  It's not changing , no ? It you don't
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah , if Click somewhere , you'll see features . Yes , it does .
B :  Why ?
B :  Oops .
A :  So Oh , sorry . Mm-hmm .
D :  Maybe put minus two , so it looks uh more reasonable .
B :  Yeah . Why not .
D :  Yeah , anyway No , minus two .
B :  Minus .
D :  Nobody will know . It's not recorded , is it ? Okay , we're on time . Good .
A :  Mm .
B :  Good .
A :  Okay .
C :  So now on , we can increase our Still you have two more . Maybe we can use it for our party .
A :  Oh , we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want . Oh . Both its it's cool .
B :  And a battery and a battery , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  No , now we are exp exceeding I think . It
B :  Now it's fancy , let's add one instead of two .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , that
D :  Is it ?
A :  Yeah , yeah y
D :  I think we're exceeding now . We have to remove the
C :  No , but point five point three .
D :  Uh , it's better . I think they are counting uh We would prefer , yeah . Maximum is maximum . So , remove one of them . Yeah . Okay . Okay , we're uh on target .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Mm . It's maximum and don't have to Yeah , yeah . Uh
C :  Is really strict ? Oh .
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  Uh , mm-mm .
A :  Yeah . Mm . Okay . Mm . So target reached .
D :  I'm just curious to see this uh my address chip on print .
C :  Ho
A :  It's um English uh Yeah .
D :  Trick . Uh , I would say it's the Russian trick , but Anyway No , they may have some their origins , strange origins
A :  Yeah , but uh is uh English . So Mm .
C :  Oh . Uh
B :  Well , I don't know . I don't know .
B :  I am not sure who was programming this calculator , you know .
B :  'Cause uh
B :  I wonder if we put A_ or B_ somewhere instead of a number .
D :  No , no , no . Let's finish this meeting instead .
A :  Mm , let's try . Okay .
C :  And we can discuss all these things in our party .
B : 
A :  I save it uh
D :  What else ?
A :  Okay , so next mm
D :  No . This is right .
A :  No , that's yours . Sorry .
D :  Okay , so finance , that's done . Are the cost under twelve ? Yes . Project evaluation , good .
A :  'Kay .
C :  Mm yeah , very much .
A :  Okay . So now
B :  Next slide .
D :  Project process .
A :  We have to make um
D :  Safe uh asse uh safe assessment .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Mm . See mm how Are we a good team ? Mm .
D :  Yeah , I think we've listened to everybody . Everybody could say what they thought .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  And uh
A :  Is there enough room for creativity ?
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm . And you .
D :  Yeah . When we see the results , there is no doubt there Maybe a lack of leadership ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's really
A :  Mm . Oh . Okay . Well , project evaluation .
C :  Yeah .
B :  M maybe not , huh ?
D :  Team-work , very strong , I would say . Team-work , no problem .
C :  Yeah , our team-work is really strong .
D :  Means .
D :  Whiteboard , digital pens .
C :  Oh , we still , I guess .
B :  What was the Oh yeah , what was good ? Everything . What was bad ?
D :  Yeah , I think white-board is useful . Digital pens , useful .
C :  Hmm .
D :  New ideas found ?
A :  So , you say , is there sheep ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Luck . Okay . So luck , but good . Which imply good uh team performance .
D :  But uh
D :  Yeah , but uh then I I mus
B :  Yeah . A good leader , you know , a good leader is somewhere in the shade and
D :  That's true . And there's uh one very important point . We're on time .
C :  Don't really .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Meetings finish when they have to or even before .
C :  And we also
C :  Mm . We made Mm .
D :  The for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing .
B :  Of course . Uh
A :  Okay . Mm .
B :  Not to waste time , that's important .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , we have other uh remote controls to create .
B :  We need time f
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  Ah , we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding .
A :  A lot of uh
B :  New materials .
D :  Mm . .
C :  New materials , new s uh this fancy strawberry design .
A :  Yeah , uh new ways of doing financial
D :  Mm , yeah .
D :  Hey , just wondering if my uh what about the the pink the pinkness of that uh
C :  And new tricks .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm . They're working on um pink titanium .
D :  . They are working on a Okay , good .
C :  Ah , very .
D :  I think we are great . There's no no other words for that .
B :  Budget .
C :  Yeah .
D :  We are probably the best . Real Reaction is uh Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Alright .
A :  Mm yeah . Yeah , we're really nice . Yeah . Mm . Okay . I think it's
D :  Finished ?
D :  Ah , celebration . Are the costs within the budget ? Of course they are . Yeah . Is the project evaluated ? Yes , it is .
B :  .
A :  Yeah . Uh How Yeah . Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , yeah , it's We got two Good score .
B :  Yeah , it is .
