A :  So welcome . The first kick-off meeting . What shall we do ? First the opening , then the rest . What are we going to do . We m have to make a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy and user-friendly .
A :  So we will get back th on that . First we have to make a functional design . After that we have to make a conceptual design , and then after that a detailed design . So we'll discuss that later .
A :  First we have a look at . So first to we have to make a small painting . What have do we have to do . First you can save the documents . We have to do that every time we make something . You can print it . No . And we have to use the pen and the eraser .
A :  So Now . We all have to use this one . You have to make your own favourite animal . So I'll make an example . First don't touch that things .
D :  Yep .
A :  You can use the pen . And then you can make um
C :  Nice .
A :  something .
A :  Um you can change some things . Um format ,
A :  line , and
A :  change it .
A :  And you can change the
A :  colour .
C :  An elephant .
A :  So that's it .
A :  So
A :  So and after it you have to save it . Now we can make a new one . You have to paint now . So you're next .
D :  Okay .
D :  Oh .
C :  'Kay .
D :  Well we will try .
D :  Where it going ?
C :  .
B :  Hmm .
B :  That's uh strange .
C :  .
A :  What is going on ?
C :  pop-ups .
A :  What are you What ?
D :  Hmm .
A :  .
C :  What is this , Pictionary .
D :  Uh
A :  Um
C :  Uh a bird .
A :  Is a It is a It is a
C :  Bird .
A :  A duck .
D :  Mm .
D :  So
D :  Now save ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yes .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Now uh blank ?
A :  Blank , yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay next one .
B :  Okay . Let's try this . Uh
C :  Whoo .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Um . Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Oh .
C :  Oh not . Oh .
C :  Okay . Okay . Yeah . No problem .
C :  Shit happens .
D :  I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now .
D :  Okay .
C :  A parrot . Ish .
D :  Wow .
D :  Oh .
C :  He did it before .
B :  Uh
B :  No , no . Yeah . Okay .
D :  Nice .
C :  Oh .
A :  Very good .
B :  Uh blank .
C :  Thank you .
A :  Okay . Very good . So um you can always go back . So
A :  That's it . So that was two . Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it .
A :  So now we have to think about what we will make . First I wanna hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So
C :  Uh I will start . Uh Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think . And uh g big buttons , m uh that's easier to use than uh I think .
A :  F first .
B :  No .
C :  Not all the small buttons , you don't know
A :  Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ?
C :  Big buttons , positive . All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for .
A :  Positive .
A :  Okay . What are your experiences ?
B :  Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And that it controls the channels and the the volume .
A :  Mm .
B :  And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working .
B :  And uh yeah . Uh
A :  So and do they always have that ?
B :  Yeah , but
B :  No no no . But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that . Yeah . Yeah .
A :  It's easy to you . Okay .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . That's not really ea easy . So it would be nice if we have one for all .
C :  Thank you .
C :  Help also . Thank you .
D :  And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v not easy to use . So we n barely used it .
A :  Okay so they have too much . So next . For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ?
B :  Hmm .
C :  The weight . Not not too heavy .
A :  Not too heavy .
A :  Yes .
C :  Not much buttons .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic .
C :  Uh buttons not too small .
C :  Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some uh some sort of bleep . And then you uh , hey there there's remote control .
A :  Yes .
A :  Like a phone .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So , that's .
C :  Next .
B :  Yeah well that's that are good ideas . Uh
B :  Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um
B :  Yeah .
B :  And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it .
A :  Yes .
D :  And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .
A :  Okay . This is It has to be compatible with other things . Okay .
D :  Yes .
C :  I have one more idea . Just popped up .
A :  Yes ?
C :  Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .
A :  No battery use .
A :  So more ideas ?
B :  Mm no .
A :  No okay . It's only the first ideas . So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour . Uh
A :  Okay . Next meeting , half an hour . Um , what you have to do .
A :  Well look on your . And
A :  Next instructions you'll get in your email . So
A :  This is the first meeting . See you later in half an hour .
B :  Yes .
C :  Okay . Thank you .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . So welcome back . What do do we have to do ?
D :  .
A :  So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your in the map in the
A :  From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there .
A :  Then
A :  I wanna hear from you , what you've done .
A :  And after that I have some new product requirements . So And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the
A :  Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So
C :  That's my task . Okay . Uh I've
C :  Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ?
C :  Hmm .
C :  I've save it on my computer , my presentation .
A :  Yeah on your computer , or the
C :  But where ?
A :  What's the name ?
C :  Uh uh uh
A :  What's the name of it ?
C :  It was about the working of the remote control .
A :  It's the technical function or the functional requirements .
C :  Nope .
C :  Not a of
C :  Wait .
C :  The working design . But I've saved it .
A :  Working design .
C :  But now I don't know where it is .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Working design . What is this ? Product documents .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And I import this until
A :  On the desktop .
A :  Up .
A :  up .
C :  One more .
A :  Up . Up .
A :  Up . Yes . My Documents .
A :  Nope .
C :  What the fuck is this ?
A :  Gone . Well you Um Nah . Nah , nah , nah .
A :  PowerPoint . Working design .
C :  Yeah that's the empty one .
A :  And
C :  I had one .
C :  Uh-huh .
A :  of working design .
C :  Open it .
C :  Okay here it is .
A :  Save as .
A :  Uh it's
D :  Desktop .
C :  Project .
A :  Project .
D :  Yeah . Okay . Well .
A :  Save .
C :  Okay .
A :  Very good .
C :  A little later but here it is .
A :  Okay .
A :  So
C :  So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it and I don't get it .
D :  Make it .
A :  Now have ten minutes to tell it .
C :  Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it uh of it .
A :  Okay .
C :  Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it .
C :  First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it , um because its uh not so expensive .
C :  And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it .
C :  Now And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery .
C :  And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult . And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television .
C :  That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all
C :  we all don't get it .
C :  My preferences ? It's uh it won't be uh We shouldn't make it too big .
C :  Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it .
C :  We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . That's I think it's easier .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it .
C :  This is uh just uh Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Oh oh . Two questions . The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ?
C :  If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two .
A :  Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer .
C :  Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . Just
A :  Okay so it's the size of the remote control . Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you've you need the television , wh which can use it .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But uh I think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? Or is it also for other company uh for other televisions ?
A :  Okay .
A :  I think we have to use it also on other televisions though .
C :  Then this is an option . Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the
A :  So
A :  Yeah but I don't I think it They are two different things though . We have to choose one .
A :  It has to work on o uh all televisions .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions .
C :  And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . But Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers .
C :  So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . And also different things .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah . Good idea .
C :  Yes .
D :  Will this will this add to the cost ?
C :  Uh then it won't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers .
D :  Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ?
C :  I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Not much . 'Kay .
C :  Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . Just one .
A :  Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones .
C :  Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it .
A :  Yeah but are their
A :  profits bigger than their cost ?
C :  Uh a p a a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think .
A :  Yeah but there are also design cost .
A :  I don't think When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ?
C :  Maybe . I wi I won't . But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh
A :  Would you change the cover ?
A :  No .
A :  N yeah but
A :  I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  And the other people ? What do you think about it ?
D :  Um
B :  Yeah it's a good idea . But
B :  If if it Yeah , I don't I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it .
C :  Okay . You're the Project Manager . Yes . That's it .
B :  No .
D :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
A :  That's clear . Okay thank you . So now the User Interface Designer .
B :  Oh . That's me .
B :  Uh
B :  Come on . .
B :  Ah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set .
B :  Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting .
B :  Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television .
B :  And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that .
B :  Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh
B :  We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more .
B :  Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ .
B :  Yeah well that's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ?
B :  Basic or multifunctional ?
A :  We'll got back on that later .
B :  Okay yeah . Yeah well the that was just on my mind . So uh I didn't know what uh
D :  Yes .
B :  what way we would go .
B :  Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk .
C :  'Kay .
A :  'Kay , thank you .
A :  Then it's your turn , the marketing expert .
D :  Okay .
D :  Uh um m
D :  Yeah .
D :  Um yeah okay . This bit too far .
D :  So
D :  So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls .
D :  Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not .
D :  Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls .
D :  Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy .
D :  And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings .
D :  Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection .
D :  And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important .
D :  Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings .
D :  Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups .
D :  Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I I think the younger will be most interest in it .
D :  But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it .
D :  Now you can clearly see young users say . I will that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think . And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it .
D :  Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here .
D :  And um they are more critical on their money spending .
D :  Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent .
D :  So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at .
D :  Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use ,
D :  remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested .
D :  And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um well th uh that's my second point . Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It's about discussion we had earlier . Um
D :  You can find most functions on a T_V_ set .
D :  So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness .
D :  And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one .
D :  But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that .
D :  That were my findings .
A :  Okay thank you . Yes .
C :  Yeah . I have uh one question . If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . Uh I think we don't have that in our budget . Do you think ? Like
D :  Yes .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  No .
D :  No .
B :  And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . So it's
C :  No . No .
B :  Yeah , it's hard to uh
B :  get the younger
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  group .
A :  I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Just the L_C_D_ ? Mm-hmm .
A :  Yes . Only the L_C_D_ .
A :  So But we'll come back on that .
D :  Okay .
A :  Now
A :  Oh , go on .
A :  What d d d um
A :  Um
A :  Uh we go back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So
A :  not necessary . Next .
A :  Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . Third .
A :  We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff .
A :  Fourth point .
A :  Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site .
A :  Next .
A :  Um no .
A :  We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So like
A :  you said , we need the . Maybe it's good to put it in a document .
A :  Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us .
D :  Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .
A :  Sorry ?
D :  The the requirements you just said , maybe we should first have a discussion about that . I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .
A :  Yes .
A :  Yes , it's okay .
A :  Yeah but we don't use it . It's a new requirement . So , it's not my requirement .
C :  'Kay , we'll just have to do that . Okay .
A :  We have to do this .
D :  Okay . Okay sorry . Then uh
C :  No discussion about it . Okay . Unfortunately .
A :  No .
A :  what controls do we need ?
A :  Who first ?
B :  Well a power button ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh power .
B :  Uh the well um I think separate channels . So
A :  Uh mm channel .
B :  But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something .
A :  Channel
A :  Zero to nine .
B :  Uh volume .
A :  Volume .
A :  Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ?
D :  Mine ? It's the functional requirements .
A :  Okay .
A :  We had w uh no no no no .
A :  Where was that example of the
B :  Oh mine .
A :  Johan . That was the the the the the technical
B :  Technical .
A :  Hallo .
A :  Okay . What do we need ?
A :  On-off . Zero to nine .
C :  To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down .
A :  Yeah that's the channel .
D :  D Yeah . Do we make a menu ?
A :  Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus .
A :  Uh
D :  Uh
A :  M Menu . I think um
A :  only one or
A :  two numbers .
B :  Mm yes .
A :  And
A :  Hello ?
A :  That's ch
D :  I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection , and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .
A :  Yes .
A :  On the L_C_D_ screen ,
A :  you mean ?
D :  Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .
A :  Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions .
D :  Yes .
C :  But then we come to the costs .
A :  we need
A :  N Yes . But if we
A :  have this
D :  'Kay .
D :  But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um
D :  remote control .
D :  And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .
A :  So now we don't have a lot of buttons .
A :  Is this enough ?
B :  Mute .
A :  Mute .
A :  Maybe in the menu ?
B :  Um
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh
A :  Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  thing to do .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe more ?
A :  No .
A :  Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons .
A :  And
A :  I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to
C :  But now we have only the buttons . And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or
A :  Yes .
A :  No that's for the next phase . Um
C :  Okay .
A :  Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  That's for the So uh next point .
A :  Now we have lunch-break .
A :  After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No .
A :  Your individual action , you can find them in the email .
A :  So now it's time for lunch .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay . Good idea .
A :  Thanks for coming .
A :  Okay . Well , let's start . What are we doing ? Oops .
B :  Hmm .
C :  Ah , pinball .
A :  Okay . Okay . Not doing . Uh
D :  Mm . Ah . Hey . Ah . Now I have my screen back too .
B :  Oh .
A :  Very good .
A :  Okay . we have presentations . So first , it's your turn . Yeah . Isn't it amazing .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mine . Oh , great .
C :  Huh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Very interesting .
B :  Uh
A :  Industrial Designer . Interface concept .
B :  Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept .
B :  Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh
B :  uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences .
B :  Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine .
B :  Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display .
B :  Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples . Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh
D :  Large . A lot a lot of buttons buttons .
B :  Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . Um , power buttons are mostly at the top
B :  uh left or right .
B :  Um , well we see the the the same uh
B :  arrows . Like there . And uh
B :  Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue .
B :  And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ . So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  Yeah . So , that's
A :  Can you go back one page ?
A :  For the uh menu , what do we use for that ?
B :  Uh , well
A :  We don't have buttons for the menu . Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel .
B :  Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea . So , uh how
A :  Okay . But uh
A :  You have to put it on the
B :  Like this . Or or this .
A :  Yeah .
B :  And that the menu button is okay .
A :  Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .
B :  Yeah , okay . Uh , so the
D :  Yes .
B :  The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh , well that's something to uh think about .
A :  Okay .
C :  Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case .
B :  Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .
A :  Not too much colours .
B :  Uh , no . Not too much . But uh No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh and
A :  No , it's not flower power .
A :  S okay .
B :  Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh
B :  opinion .
A :  Okay .
B :  That was that .
A :  Thank you .
A :  So , you're next .
C :  I'm next , okay .
C :  Yes . No . Here we go .
C :  Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also .
A : 
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said .
C :  Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then ,
C :  I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket .
C :  Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice have it curved .
C :  And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research .
C :  Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel .
C :  And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb .
C :  And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one , you can see channel one .
D :  Hmm .
C :  The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it .
C :  And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive .
C :  And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera .
C :  You have any more questions about this ?
C :  I think the main thing is we look at the costs . And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has .
D :  Yep .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But , thi i uh This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , not .
C :  Not with an L_C_D_ . No .
A :  No , isn't . But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons .
A :  Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher .
A :  But then it's not easy to use scroll uh
A :  wheel .
C :  Th then you'll see it on the television .
A :  If you don't
A :  Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up .
A :  When you scroll .
C :  Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty .
A :  Yeah but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . So you may not be uh
A :  No . The television must do that . So
C :  Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which
C :  can provide our uh remote control .
A :  Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room .
A :  And mostly they are smaller . So
C :  Yes .
C :  But that won't be a problem .
C :  I think .
A :  Most the times that are not advanced televisions .
C :  No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ?
C :  I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . But I don't know uh how much higher .
D :  'Cause it I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better .
A :  That's important .
C :  That's true .
D :  And that might uh bring back the costs uh
C :  But then we'll I think we must discuss who uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . It's very important .
C :  I can uh look on my uh
C :  Uh
C :  Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .
A :  Yeah , more expensive . But how much ?
C :  Doesn't say .
A :  Oh .
D :  Huh .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  That's from my manufacturing division .
A :  Okay . Well , thank you . Next .
D :  'Kay .
D :  My turn ?
C :  Yes ?
D :  Mm . So
D :  So
D :  Yeah . So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . Uh , I did some trend-watching . It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . 'Cause if you don't , you won't sell .
D :  So , well how we did do that ? Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Of course , well known for their uh trend uh trends .
D :  And well , uh what did you find ? Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products .
D :  And um , material ? That should feel have uh a spongy feeling . And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it .
D :  Then the old and rich . They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . And um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . Now , another picture .
D :  To get a feeling for this .
D :  Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it's always if there's it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be uh can be totally different .
D :  And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . So , that's uh one thing to keep in mind .
C :  Changing covers .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Any questions ?
C :  Nope .
B :  No .
A :  No . It's clear .
A :  So now ,
A :  it's uh Ah , let's see .
A :  Now , w we have to decide
A :  Well , we have to decide on the concept . So , we have to look at
A :  'S next . Components and user interface concept . So
A :  Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board .
A :  First , uh user interface .
C :  Uh , uh-uh .
C :  How w how we how we make it ? Uh
A :  Yes , a concept on uh Just
C :  Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ?
C :  Yeah , but if I paint with
A :  I'll paint . Okay . Well
D :  Mm .
A :  Something like this ? Or
B :  Mm , yes .
A :  Shapes or What do we need ?
D :  Can make several uh concepts .
B :  What ?
A :  Yes , okay .
D :  We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand .
A :  Okay .
C :  More like something
D :  Yeah I I I uh yes .
C :  M like Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it . Uh I have to . I'm not a designer . It's more three D_ . Like , um when you have
A :  And you have to .
A :  Yeah .
C :  a part here . This is the remote control . And then you have something like
C :  th this under it . So , it's easier to get it like this . It's like a gun .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
A : 
D :  Yeah .
D :  A g Mm . .
A :  So , it has to be soft ?
C :  And it has to be soft , yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  So , you can squeeze in it and Sorry ? Buttons on top of it . And here .
A :  And uh , the buttons ?
A :  Buttons .
C :  The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb .
A :  No , it won't .
B :  But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ?
C :  But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . One till uh uh zero till nine . And the b
B :  Yeah , okay . But but how
A :  But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . How
C :  Yeah ? Or two buttons .
B :  Okay .
D :  And i if we go to uh
A :  Uh , two scroll uh wheels .
C :  If uh 'Kay c If we do If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back
B :  Mm .
A :  That's th that's more difficult .
D :  But if we have uh a me Yeah . If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ?
A :  It's better in
C :  with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . Because uh , from h hundred uh remote controls , ninety nine have it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu .
C :  Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu .
D :  Uh-uh .
A :  Yeah , but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? You don't know . So , there's no menu .
C :  I don't know .
C :  It's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we don't have teletext .
A :  No . So you can't use it .
C :  And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher .
A :  Okay , we make two concepts . One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ .
C :  'Kay .
C :  But you all like this kind of thing . Uh
A :  Good concept . But
C :  With the scroll button . And and this one has to be soft . And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . Or some kind of rubber around it .
A :  That's one .
D :  Uh-uh .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It's one .
A :  Two . Number two .
B :  And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . Like uh
C :  Yeah . Yeah . Ah that's nice . Here . Trigger .
B : 
A :  No . But when you handle it , you put it on and off .
B :  Just to uh
A :  It's not good to use .
B :  Oh , like a
A :  Yeah , but I'll zap . Fuck . Out .
B :  Yeah .
A :  No , it's not good . Now , second concept . One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Then uh
A :  Paint it .
C :  Paint it ? With the scroll thing on , like this ?
A :  One with two scroll buttons and one with without . Yeah .
A :  Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ .
C :  So ?
C :  Draw it .
A :  Unbelievable . Do I have to do everything . Blank . You have
A :  Not so difficult .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But if you put push the the menu button
A :  Uh , that's the menu . There for the L_C_D_ screen .
B :  Yeah , wh what
B :  Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose .
A :  You have to
A :  For the menu .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . One
A :  that way . And one
A :  that way .
A :  So
A :  Then it depends on the cost . S On and off .
C :  But is it easy to use ? When you have it on your left side , and
A :  When it's not too big . Just like a a phone .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um more separate , yeah . Like , you have the menu button in between uh
C :  Separate , more separate , h yeah .
A :  Yes , okay .
C :  Yeah . On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button .
C :  But would it be easy to use then ? If it's like you have a big uh
A :  Very good .
A :  Is it better ?
A :  When you uh the menu , you have to go there there there there .
C :  I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . They were like round curves , uh different uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay . That's that's the outside . But now the First the buttons .
C :  Okay , okay , okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Think we have we have now two buttons missing . The uh um
D :  The mute button .
A :  Sorry ?
D :  We have two buttons missing . The mute button . And um , the to to uh have to uh numbers
A :  Mute . And the other .
D :  Okay . But , uh
A :  Yeah . Not so difficult .
C :  Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle .
A :  But how do you wanna solve it ?
C :  With the switch button .
A :  Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy .
C :  No like uh
A :  Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down .
C :  Oh , you mean like that . Uh , then you can also have like uh th um
A :  Yeah .
A :  A joystick .
C :  Yeah , and joystick , I think .
A :  Yeah . But is it uh
A :  Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop .
C :  Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . A little bit bigger , with easier thi
A :  Mean , it's better . But how expensive it is ?
C :  I don't know .
A :  Oh . Why do I pay you for ?
A :  Um , well um
A :  Better ideas .
D :  Okay .
C :  Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And No , no . It won't work .
A :  For the young peoples I think scroll button's good .
C :  Yeah . Uh-huh .
A :  So
A :  Think we have to keep them .
C :  Or a remote control more like joystick .
A :  Yeah , but is it That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better .
A :  A small one .
C :  A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k
A :  No just like in a
C :  Playstation thing .
A :  a laptop . Small , round .
A :  Then it's
A :  not so big .
C :  No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control . Just like a Playstation thing .
A :  Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can You have to use t with one hand .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So
A :  Maybe , if it's possible , it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . A small one .
A :  So , please look at it .
C :  No , that's okay , I got
D :  And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ?
C :  Uh they're not uh
C :  in details . It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ?
A :  Yeah we I think you get it .
A :  So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it .
C :  Then I have to come with it .
A :  Yes .
C :  I got my personal costs . I I don't I don't know the costs .
A :  Your problem . Not mine .
C :  Then I'll uh make something up .
A :  Okay . So , do we have other concepts ?
A :  Then for the components ,
A :  we use a normal battery .
B :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Then it's
A :  Ch cheapest way , I think .
C :  Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .
A :  No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . So we use a normal battery .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
C :  Okay .
A :  Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .
C :  Depends on the scroll .
A :  Scroll .
C :  If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . And that's
A :  Yeah . And uh , we If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to
C :  Uh the most expensive . Yeah .
A :  Yes , okay . So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . Okay .
C :  If we Yeah . If we No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .
A :  Okay . So , uh the shapes of the
A :  depends on the L_C_D_ and But ,
A :  it has to be small .
A :  I think .
C :  Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?
A :  If you have pistol , it L_C_D_'s not easy .
A :  Y y Yeah but
C :  Just use your thumb .
A :  If you use a phone .
C :  If you Yeah . I use my thumb .
A :  k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is
C :  Yeah .
C :  If you have a joystick on
A :  Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .
C :  No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh straight .
A :  Yeah .
A :  No . No , no .
C :  That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .
D :  Uh
A :  Yeah , but then you look forward . And then you can y
D :  Uh , yeah , but
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah ?
A :  N well , if you have to look at it .
D :  If you
C :  'Kay . Here's our designer .
D :  If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Then it goes like this .
C :  Yeah , why not .
A :  If th n well
C :  It's for the younger people . It's something new .
A :  Yes , of course . That's good good . But the um , it may not break .
B :  It's uh
C :  Now we put uh rubber around it .
A :  Okay . If that's possible .
D :  Um , Yeah .
C :  Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .
A :  Okay .
B :  Or you can uh
D :  I can't see the .
B :  turn it inside .
D :  But , uh the easy of uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it .
B :  But that's
C :  Huh .
B :  No , that's true .
D :  Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh
A :  Yeah of course . Okay .
C :  This is something new .
A :  Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So , um we have one minute .
C :  Costs are okay .
B :  .
D :  One .
A :  I think . No . More . Seven .
D :  No . You have more . You have still ten .
A :  Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up .
C :  Oh , that's us together .
A :  You two stay here . Paint it .
B :  Okay .
A :  Now you have to .
A :  So
A :  I think it's clear . Check your mail . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
A :  It has to be ready in the next meeting . So
D :  What ?
B :  Cookie .
D :  Okay .
A :  Next meeting is called the detailed design . So
A :  Everyth everything has to be ready .
D :  Okay .
A :  Thanks for your attention .
C :  'Kay .
D :  See you at the next meeting .
C :  Bye bye .
A :  Okay . So , now um , last time . Can you uh push the button ? One time please . So
A :  I'm still the secretary .
A :  Now uh , I ask you to presentate the prototype . One of your you two .
C :  I don't care .
B :  Oh this , you mean ?
A :  Yes . The prototype .
C :  Huh ?
B :  Yes , well uh
B :  this is it .
D :  This is it .
A :  Well , thank you . Uh , now
B :  It's uh it's uh it's yellow . And uh , this is rubber .
B :  And and and this too .
B :  the sides . And the rest is hard plastic .
A :  Yes .
B :  And uh
B :  We uh we had some uh We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside . And then it covers the these buttons
A :  Okay .
B :  until here or something . And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .
D :  Yes .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu .
B :  And then it can break .
A :  Okay . And the buttons ?
B :  Uh , well uh
C :  Big .
B :  Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh yeah , and the mute and the the other button . Yeah .
B :  Channel higher channel button .
C :  .
D :  Yeah .
A :  And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .
B :  Uh , yes . Yes , that's uh
C :  Yes .
B :  Very obvious .
C :  Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ .
A :  What's the R_R_ d
C :  The R_R_ ?
B :  R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .
A :  Okay . Very good .
A :  So , we have
D :  That's on the rub rubber part .
B :  Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .
A :  So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good . So , that's it . That's prototype . Now , the finance .
B :  Oh .
D :  Yeah ?
A :  We don't know if it's th it if it's okay . So , I'm gonna look . We have Sorry ?
D :  Alright .
D :  Do we Do we change the
D :  Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?
A :  Finance is um Yeah it's
A :  No , first uh
A :  Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet . Sorry .
D :  Okay . That's uh um That can be none .
D :  Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up .
D :  Uh-oh . Okay .
D :  Um , yeah . Well , we uh uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences .
D :  Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document
A :  Criteria .
D :  You So we open up that blank here . Um
D :  Think I can Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can
D :  get a number in here .
D :  Hmm .
A :  No , it's okay .
D :  Well , uh we can't do that .
C :  I'll get it .
A :  Oh , it's okay .
D :  Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative .
D :  Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together .
D :  And in the end , we will c uh count an average
D :  of all rating . The first uh on each item .
A :  What do you think ?
D :  Yeah , I think it's uh Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ .
D :  So , it Um , I think I will give it a yeah , yeah , yeah , a four . Hmm .
C :  I think the scroll-button is something also uh new .
C :  What uh not anoth uh , not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an
C :  seven . Si six six . Sorry , six .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So now i I think you uh see it um its statement . And you true or false . And true is one .
C :  Oh , true or false . Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . Sorry .
D :  So , yeah . Yeah .
A :  Two .
A :  You ?
B :  Three .
A :  Me too . So it's a three .
D :  'Kay . Um , well
D :  It's a one . The first item .
D :  So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .
B :  Mm
D :  Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that .
A :  So it's a
D :  That's uh a six .
C :  Five .
B :  Mm , four .
A :  Yes , it's for the
A :  younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .
B :  Yeah , but it's it's
A :  So I think it's four .
B :  Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . So I mean , the colours are for young people , but
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  No .
A :  Yes . So , I think it's four .
B :  older
B :  Yeah .
C :  Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours .
B :  Yeah . Maybe .
A :  Okay . Give it a four . Yep .
C :  Four .
D :  Four . Uh , okay . Mm .
A :  We put the fashion in electronics .
D :  That's uh the motto of our company .
D :  Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ?
D :  I um Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two .
C :  Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh
C :  techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two .
B :  Yes . Two .
D :  Two .
A :  Uh , I say uh a five . It's not fashion , it's new .
A :  It must be a fashion .
A :  But it isn't . Yes . It w If it's not a fashion
C :  It it will be fashion .
A :  we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five .
D :  Uh Okay .
B :  Then make it th three .
D :  Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too . Yeah , agree ?
A :  No . Oh . I use my feet though .
C :  'Kay . Three is okay .
C :  Oh , we'll wait outside .
D :  A three .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah okay .
D :  The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five .
C :  I give it a one .
B :  .
B :  Yes , a one . I like it .
A :  Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half .
D :  We have to do our uh Two or three ? Two . Okay .
C :  Say two . Two .
A :  Okay , two .
D :  So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep .
D :  Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average .
D :  So , um that's why it's a negative in it .
D :  Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to uh this fashion , I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers .
D :  But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two .
C :  One .
A :  You ?
B :  One .
A :  Me too . One .
D :  One .
D :  Um , but where where is the ?
A :  Next , six .
A :  It does not get lost easily .
D :  So
D :  Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?
C :  Uh Just a small thing .
B :  Yes .
A :  No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? I don't think so .
B :  Yeah , but uh
B :  Yeah .
C :  Ah . Yellow . Looks like a pistol . Uh
A :  Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So
C :  It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .
A :  No .
A :  It won't get lost . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh
D :  It won't .
A :  A one ?
C :  Yeah , o one .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , a one . Next .
D :  One .
D :  Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .
A :  Yeah me
C :  Yeah . Me too .
A :  That was our target . Two .
C :  Two . Yeah ? Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yep . Right .
A :  There's a fancy look-and-feel .
D :  Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ?
D :  I would say yes . So um
D :  Well , let's also give this a two . T
C :  I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy trendy .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yes , a one .
A :  I say a two .
A :  It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy . So I think s two is better .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Okay . Two . And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends .
C :  Two is okay . .
A :  No , it's new . Innovation .
D :  If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh
D :  We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . So , I would did not give this uh a one or two . I We'll go for a three .
C :  Oh .
C :  I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh
A :  .
D :  Yes .
C :  But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm , three .
A :  Me too . Three .
D :  A three .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . So , we will do that . Yes .
A :  Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , . Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .
D :  By nine .
C :  Two .
D :  Yeah . Um , uh okay .
D :  Two .
A :  Yep .
D :  Come on .
A :  Uh , nah .
A :  Okay .
D :  So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .
B :  Yes .
A :  So , it's good .
D :  So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job .
A :  Okay . Thank you .
C :  Yeah , I think .
D :  Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes .
D :  And I closed your slide-show .
A :  Okay . Back to my uh
D :  Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming .
A :  Yep .
A :  Next please . So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ?
D :  Next .
D :  Finance .
A :  Um , so if uh I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Cheapest there is .
A :  Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip .
C :  Expensive .
A :  Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print .
A :  We have that one .
C :  Well , it's the most advanced .
A :  We have the simple , regular and advanced .
C :  Advanced .
A :  We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved .
A : 
A :  So
A :  Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . we have half rubber , half plastic .
B :  Mm , yes .
A :  No titanium . Special colour .
A :  Yes , yellow .
C :  Uh , yellow .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Interface , push-button .
A :  Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . So , we have the L_C_D_
A :  We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?
C :  One .
D :  One .
A :  And it's not really a s
C :  Joystick uh thing .
D :  .
A :  Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement . Special colour . We already Uh , that's the from the for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour .
B :  Mm , yeah .
A :  So , then uh then then then then then then
A :  Then
C :  We're not gonna make it .
A :  Uh , no . It's too expensive .
C :  Yeah . Wh
A :  So , we have to change something . Fifteen Euros . Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve .
C :  What what are the costs ?
C :  Fifteen .
A :  We have rubber , special colour .
D :  .
D :  We would have uh n
C :  A special colour . Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .
A :  Oh , no , we No , it's uh
A :  Sorry ?
C :  Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?
D :  For a remote control . I've For a remote control , I think it is .
C :  What ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick .
D :  For up down left right .
A :  Um , then we uh lose
A :  two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much .
A :  Exactly the special colours .
C :  And what if we use only one sort of um
A :  So
C :  Um just only plastic or only rubber ?
A :  That's one Euro .
C :  One Euro discount .
A :  So , I don't think that's good .
A :  Mm
A :  I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ .
A :  If
C :  If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .
A :  Yes .
A :  Then it's
A :  only thirteen Euros .
C :  And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?
A :  So uh yeah .
A :  Yeah . Then you have Or you have to cut this off .
C :  Uh uh-uh .
A :  Then it's not good anymore . So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look .
C :  No .
A :  We
C :  And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour it's a normal colour , wh No one will see it .
A :  Yellow rubber .
A :  Yeah , normal .
C :  Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .
A :  Uh
C :  And it's twelve Euros , I think .
A :  One minute , please . Uh Is it maximum . Um
A :  Yeah , it's normal colour .
A :  But if you lose the
A :  joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?
C :  No . Uh , no , no , no . Uh
A :  Or it's then a regular ?
C :  Oh , wait wait wait .
D :  The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .
C :  Oh yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
A :  And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?
C :  If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah , regular chip . But
A :  Is it a good design ?
C :  Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have
C :  the L_C_D_ .
D :  If uh
C :  So , the T_V_s has to uh have to be up-to-date .
D :  If we have the n no buttons If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have uh , we have thirteen Euros ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm , yes .
D :  And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Then it's okay .
C :  Huh . No knew that .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .
C :  Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .
A :  Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit .
A :  And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,
B :  Okay . All the same uh
A :  you have to pay
A :  point two Euros .
C :  So , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour . But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh
A :  Yes .
C :  for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?
B :  Mm , yeah .
B :  Recognisable . Like what Yeah .
C :  Recognisable , yeah .
A :  Yes .
B :  Mm , yeah .
A :  So

C :  Oh , well that's clear .
A :  So
A :  And
A :  Where's ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  So , now it's
C :  And the joystick away .

A :  Yeah . It is . But then it will be
A :  just that ones .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Now it's
D :  still , he waited at the
A :  Very good . Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well
D :  No .
A :  What do you think of it ? Uh
C :  About the
A :  About the project .
D :  Project .
C :  process . Went good .
C :  Uh
C :  I think uh the creativity uh was good enough . We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um
C :  Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . So yeah that was clear .
C :  Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it .
C :  And uh no , uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult .
C :  But , nah . New ideas found .
C :  Nope .
A :  Okay . And you .
B :  Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh
B :  Yeah , it uh
B :  It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um
D :  Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse .
D :  Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others .
D :  And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking .
D :  To tell their opinion .
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions . So , it's good for the speed .
C :  No .
B :  No .
C :  Yep .
A :  So , I think we're ready . Good price . Evaluation ready .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Ready .
C :  Beer .
