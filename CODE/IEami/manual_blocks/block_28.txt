A :  Good morning .
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Yeah , busy job .
A :  Good morning .
A :  So
A :  Oh , good morning everyone .
C :  Good morning .
B :  Good morning .
A :  I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting .
A :  I've prepared a little presentation .
A :  My name is and uh I hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes , as will I . Um I'm the Project Manager of this project , and uh , well I will tell you on what actually is the project . This is uh the agenda for our first meeting . Um this is the opening , then we will get I will hope we will get acquainted to each other . We'll do a little tool training with these two things . We'll take a look at the project plan .
A :  Uh there will be time for discussion . Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product . And then we will close this session . Um but first of all we I'd like to uh introduce you to this room . Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table . Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face . Um there are cameras
A :  everywhere around the room especially here for your face , of course , and this isn't a pie , it's a a set of microphones and there are microphones here also . But please uh don't be afraid of them .
A :  They won't hurt you . Um well uh I said I'm the Project Manager and uh I'm hoping uh for a good project and uh I'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project . Let's start with the ladies .
B :  Well
B :  Well uh I'm uh and my uh function is User Interface Design ,
B :  I think . So uh that's me .
C :  Okay , uh I'm uh I'm the Industrial Designer and I uh hope to uh look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project .
A :  Okay , so I .
B :  Me too .
D :  My name's . I'm uh Marketing Expert . My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers . So I also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other .
A :  Okay , well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company . That's good . Um well I said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which uh has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly . And uh I hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a product .
A :  Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods . It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far . Okay . But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here . I already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of uh much use to us . Uh
A :  we will have to take advantage of these two things . They are smart boards . As you can see , you can give a presentation on them . And uh this one here is a white board . I will uh instruct you about that soon . Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room .
A :  Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . As you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here . Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page , um uh to go back and forward between pages , and of course uh to save it every now and then . Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance
A :  like this if everything's okay , but I first have to put it on the pen , you see I'm new to it too . Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want . As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it's not such a fast board , it's a smart board but also a slow board . Uh but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things , so we have uh est left . And um you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that . Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results . Um does everyone understand this
B :  Oh .
B :  So we can't erase anything .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  nice application ? Well you can erase it with the eraser , but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page , but just create a new blank one . I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet .
B :  Right .
B :  Alright .
A :  But you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but don't uh delete entire pages . And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five . Um that's what you will need for our first exercise , because I'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal .
A :  It's also to gets to know each other because um I'm asking three things , uh for that uh drawing , to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which I also showed you . Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word . Well I'm not very good at drawing , but I will uh go first
C :  Okay .
A :  and um try to draw
A :  Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing , eh .
D :  Good .
C :  Hmm .
D :  No .
B :  It's a sheep .
D :  Dinos Dinosaur .
C :  Seal , a seal .
D :  Beaver .
B :  A beaver .
C :  A be
A :  Well it uh
B :  It's weird .
A :  could be everything .
C :  Mm . With a tail and a mouth .
A :  Maybe when I put on
B :  It has wings ?
D :  Turtle .
A :  this thing
A :  it could be a turtle , or a snail , and
C :  Snail .
B :  Well the snail doesn't have legs .
C :  Okay .
A :  But a turtle has . And those are slow .
A :  And I hope our project group will not be slow , but we will uh work to a good result and do it uh as fast as we can . Okay , time for another animal . Would you like to go next ?
D :  No problem . No problem . Mm . It was four months ?
C :  Sure .
B :  Oh right .
D :  Nice , okay .
B :  Well .
C :  The hell .
D :  To make it a little bit easier .
B :  It's a giraffe .
C :  Make that cute .
B :  Or a dinosaur .
D :  No , it's a giraffe .
D :  'Kay . I think it's
D :  easy to r uh to
D :  recognise as a giraffe . Yeah , the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything . And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project . So that's my favourite animal .
B :  Yes . Giraffe .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . Could you write the words , uh underneath it ?
D :  Anything else you need to know ?
D :  Oh , uh
A :  Or more words .
C :  Tall .
D :  Tall .
D :  So , 'kay .
B :  Should I uh
B :  Alright .
B :  So I can draw , but uh
B :  Uh .
B :  Well .
B :  Oh .
C :  B
D :  It's a mouse .
C :  Bunny rabbit .
D :  A bunny rabbit .
B :  Oh wrong one .
B :  Uh .
B :  Well uh you can guess what it is , I hope .
D :  Uh-huh . No problem .
B :  It's a rabbit . And uh well uh it's uh quick , I guess .
A :  Little rabbits .
B :  That's uh my uh favourite animal .
A :  Okay , thank you .
C :  Okay .
A :  And our final drawing .
D :  Bob Ross .
B :  A dolphin .
D :  Dolphin .
C :  Okay , um .
C :  Uh I uh draw I I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence . One of the most intelligent uh
B :  Right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  animals in our world .
B :  Well .
C :  Yeah intelligent . I've I've uh Eraser .
B :  With an E_ .
B :  You can try out the eraser now .
C :  Pen .
C :  Well not perfect , but okay .
A :  Okay , well thank you very much . I can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group , huh ?
B :  Not really .
A :  Well , nice animals , nice words . Sounds good . Um back to business , back to the money part . Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros . And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market . And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max .
A :  Okay , well it's time uh for some discussion . I've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about . Uh what's your experience with remote controls , um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments . Uh well actually I'd like to hand the word uh back to you .
A :  What's your experience with remote control ?
C :  A lot of buttons . And you always lose them . A lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use Complex .
B :  I always lose them . Yes .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Complex .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Not user friendly .
B :  search for the buttons , which one is which and uh
D :  No .
D :  No .
D :  Boring .
A :  Boring , it's not fun to use a remote .
D :  No . Black , all black .
C :  Mm .
B :  Well .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So , yeah .
C :  Black colours .
A :  Well maybe we should try to make it fun .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  They use batteries and batteries uh and poor signal .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh .
D :  The the angle you have to use .
B :  Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls . Yes , perhaps you can integrate them or something .
D :  You had different remote controls for different devices . Yes .
C :  Yeah , different remote controls , yeah .
C :  Uh for the use of different uh devices .
B :  Yes .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Your stereo and your T_V_ and uh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Perhaps that's an idea .
D :  Yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons , so
B :  Yeah , that's right . And which you don't use .
C :  Yeah but you could uh I thin uh there's a possibility to g uh to uh
C :  to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em .
D :  Flap yeah .
B :  Right .
D :  Yeah , okay , that's possible , but it'll get very big the the remote control .
C :  That's possible , so that you only get the No n n no , just Uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday , but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in Dutch . Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly . Or uh the numbers , of course . But uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television . You only use those uh the first time , or .
B :  Yeah . You should just give it to .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Changing channel .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm . numbers .
D :  On and off .
D :  Yeah , play , pause , stop .
C :  So . Uh .
A :  Mm-hmm . So maybe a a minimalist design , the least uh possible amount uh of buttons .
C :  Yeah , I think so , yeah .
B :  Yes .
B :  But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . Because uh things for uh teletext , I dunno uh , w what's the name ?
D :  Mm-hmm , of course .
C :  Yeah , uh teletext . think so . Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat .
D :  No .
B :  Yeah . But
D :  Yeah .
C :  Right .
D :  Because I think a market will be all kind of people . Elderly p el elderly , young people , so .
B :  But if if it's if it's international you should uh look in think in Britain they have uh different things they can do with the T_V_ , or so uh that you can choose what you want to see . I dunno if you should uh take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal T_V_s that uh
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah I think that's the better one , because
C :  Yeah I I understand .
B :  And the B_B_C_ .
D :  I think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain then I think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty , I think .
C :  No .
B :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , I don't know if the they have that anywhere else , though .
D :  I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , we can leave that .
C :  When I think of it uh I think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh
D :  Not that much .
C :  to make it user friendly . So uh I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television . So uh it only has to have uh the most used buttons . You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television . In those in that
D :  Mm . Standard deliver .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Well but but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search . That's not
D :  No but
D :  Yeah . Yeah , th it it's I think that's not
C :  Yeah but I but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control . It's impossible . Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . Uh
B :  Yeah , that's right .
D :  Yeah , okay .
D :  No .
B :  Yeah that's uh .
D :  I think n m n most televisions nowadays do this .
C :  Yeah , but uh they don't use the same signal , uh on remote control . Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television .
B :  Well not everywhere .
D :  So I think numerals .
D :  Yeah , but then you have to choose the this always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . You can use which which type of television you have . That's no problem . But I think like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that's that's nowadays standard , I think .
B :  Yeah , you can choose the code .
C :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay , but uh I think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because because uh the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken , so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television , so that option is not uh optional for those uh people .
D :  Simplicity .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah g available .
B :  But the people have a new television , and c if you look into the future , then they want will want the button , if their thing is broke .
D :  True .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So we should take that in consideration .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , well any more ideas ?
C :  Oh mm , no . Things'll come up .
D :  Of course .
B :  Guess not .
A :  No ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , yeah well we have some time . Let's see what more I have to tell you . I don't think there is much left . Nope . We're starting to close . Um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes . In the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions .
A :  Um , as you can see , the different roles have uh different tasks .
A :  And there's a ping . Is it my laptop ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
C :  Stop the meeting now .
A :  Ah well that's good , five minutes and uh the meeting's over , uh right on schedule . Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification . The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design . And this was the Interface Designer ? Or the Interaction Designer . Or what was it , I_D_ ? Interface Designer , okay , first guess was right . Uh will take a look at the the working design .
B :  Yeah meeting will close in five minutes .
C :  Okay .
B :  Hmm hmm . No interface .
C :  Mm . No ?
D :  Interface .
C :  No , the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design , and the in uh usability interaction Yeah , okay . Okay .
B :  No the Yeah .
A :  Industrial Designer , okay , sorry .
A :  Let's just use the acronyms . Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach .
B :  So
B :  So I should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote , or uh , or how I don't really
A :  Uh well those instructions will be uh in the email you will receive uh shortly , I hope .
B :  Right . Alright .
B :  Me too .
A :  And of course you have your own uh expertise . Well uh that was what I had to say . Uh are there any more questions ?
D :  Uh-huh .
C :  Okay .
D :  No .
C :  No .
A :  No ? Okay well I think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working .
D :  I have one question . Where does it says we have to make a remote , because I presumed
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , one question ?
C :  Oh .
D :  She didn't know who .
D :  Okay , no , no problem .
C :  No problem . Okay .
A :  Okay we're still going . Okay , well I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly . Okay well uh see you all in about thirty minutes , then . Thank you very much .
D :  No problem . Yeah .
B :  Alright .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Alrighty . Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C : 
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Good morning , again .
C :  One question .
B :  Yeah . Choose a number ?
C :  Send . Submit .
D :  Yep yep yep yep .
C :  Mm . Yeah .
A :  All set ? Good . Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Let's see what we can find here .
A :  Okay . A very warm welcome again to everyone . Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . Um and this is what we are going to do . The opening , which we are doing now , um and the special note , I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , which means I will make uh minutes as I did of the previous meeting . And uh I also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed . Um if I'm right , there are three presentations , I guess each one of you has prepared one ? Good . And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . But I think we will need it . Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation .
B :  Yes .
C :  I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Well .
A :  You can go first , okay .
D :  Well , shall I go first with the users ?
B :  Well everybody already has his presentation , so you can adjust it .
D :  I think well okay no problem .
A :  Is there an order ? I haven't
D :  Ja precies , ja precies , ja precies
C :  So . Huh ?
C :  Okay , um
A :  And one question , uh your name Denni , is it with a
D :  E_I_E_ .
A :  I_E_ E_I_E_ , okay . Thank you .
C :  Okay , um I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . It's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . Um
C :  well so it basically works uh as I uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . Uh when you press a button , uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a
A :  Sorry .
C :  on a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh a connection that uh
C :  gives the chips , uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . Uh senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let . You know what a let is ? Okay . And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . Uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red .
B :  Yeah .
C :  That's basically uh how it works .
C :  Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , uh it is pis uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page , uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh
C :  and chips . Uh and the technology's already available , we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals .
C :  Uh I made a little uh
C :  animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works .
B :  Oh right .
D :  Animation .
C :  we tel
B :  There is something turning .
C :  There .
A :  Yeah , it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board .
C :  Okay . Uh well the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button . Uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh
C :  li uh a d ad uh electronic uh
D :  Infrared light .
C :  Yes , uh , okay . Um w after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a Morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set .
C :  Okay . S Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something , or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it . Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . And it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . Okay , well , that's my contribution to this meeting , and uh
B :  Yeah , I've got it there too .
B :  Yeah .
D :  To this meeting .
A :  Okay , thank you .
C :  two of these this meeting . So .
B :  Shall I go uh next ?
A :  Yep .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Please .
B :  So .
D :  Smoking .
B :  Well uh , my name's , and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found .
B :  Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls . You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there .
B :  Um I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that .
B :  Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? Because all the T_V_s will have them . Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much .
B :  And that is my presentation .
A :  Okay , thank you .
C :  Okay .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Check .
B :  You must still have it open .
D :  'Kay , so . We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just
D :  Yeah , and the users , actually . The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more .
D :  Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? And then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user
D :  section . Okay . Some data . Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area .
D :  Goed so .
C :  Hmm .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Findings . Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Next .
D :  Important issues about the remote . I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w
D :  seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would
D :  use a lot of but batteries .
D :  The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger
D :  etcetera . It has also be have to find easily when the label is gone . My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s uh
C :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  senden okay . So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily
D :  on the remote .
D :  Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized .
D :  or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy ,
D :  but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use .
C :  Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ?
D :  Yeah , touch screen , yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons .
B :  Mm .
C :  'Kay .
D :  And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels .
D :  And that is it .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , thank you .
B :  Oh right .
A :  Um , well thank you all , huh . I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? No ? Well ,
B :  No .
B :  Res I did not . Perhaps the rest ?
C :  No .
A :  then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them so you can
D :  Ja ,
A :  all read them . Oh , well not in this presentation . Hmm .
A :  Should be in there . Well , I can tell you them uh from my laptop . Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think . Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . So we have to keep that in mind . Um well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions .
B :  Oh .
B :  Mm .
A :  So , who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ?
B :  Well you said it should only uh work with one appliance ? Or with one uh d che only the T_V_ ?
D :  Be television .
A :  Yeah . Only be used for television .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And the video also , or not uh ?
D :  Only the television .
A :  Well it says only for television here , huh .
B :  Oh . Alright . Okay .
A :  Makes it a lot easier , huh ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  So yeah , then you can yeah .
D :  Requirements , no ? Functions .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Then it should have uh on , off , and uh
C :  Yeah for
D :  Yeah , the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , oh teletext doesn't have to be ? Um other functions . Yeah I had
C :  Standby options , yeah ?
C :  Uh yeah .
B :  Yeah . And per perhaps uh
B :  No . Well uh uh yes yes s sh A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers . Can you Don't know if that's got a name , but
C :  Two s two two digits , oh okay .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah I understand what you mean . Yeah .
D :  I think it's I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , and that's that's not relaxed
C :  It makes it twelve , yeah .
B :  Yeah . S
C :  Indeed . Okay .
C :  Well , not really And and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function . So d uh wh the Philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj to reach channel twelve . But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get
D :  to user .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So that it easy and fast .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , so you should have that one on .
C :  Uh yeah , think so .
D :  Our main targets' age are ? were ? Forty five plus , or ?
B :  Mute misschien also .
C :  Mm .
A :  Uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers uh of forty plus .
D :  Forties , okay because because younger people as
D :  Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen .
D :  From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , so I think to um
D :  Because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much , two years . You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel . With the L_C_D_ screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint , and then you can use it again .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , we we could yeah . But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . Because L_C_D_ screens are very expensive . A touch screen uh probably uh even more .
D :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Yeah but a you don't know
C :  So , true , true . But uh
D :  True .
C :  Well um is it possible to make an L_C_D_ screen uh , how was the information ?
D :  Yeah , it only says that this perce percentage like L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Because , yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical . And if the only f
C :  So perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Yeah , because our target is sixteen to forty five .
B :  But , do you
C :  Yeah but uh will we not uh
C :  exceed our uh our uh production uh
D :  Yeah you don't know how much it costs . Yeah , you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Is it possible to find out , anyway ? You know ?
D :  No , I don't have any costs here , I only have percentages .
B :  But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? Or because if it only directs at the T_V_ , then you only have uh I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Yeah .
C :  No , an L_C_D_ screen's just like uh like a drawn here . Um just uh displays several buttons , for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to p uh press them down , just like a touch screen .
B :  Yeah ?
B :  Oh right , so you can
B :  Oh , yeah alright . So you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen .
D :  Yeah , if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings , so the other buttons are gone .
C :  Yeah , we can make it possible to do that , yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah alright , oh right .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  So we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ?
B :  Yeah . Would be yeah .
D :  I think it's the most easier thing , yeah .
C :  That's my uh
A :  And hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive .
D :  No .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well we had twelve fifty , I guess , for uh production ? Yeah . I dunno how expensive an L_C_D_ screen is .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Twelve fifty .
C :  Um .
B :  Any guesses ?
C :  Well I suppose wi if the mar if our um
C :  if the i if the young people are interested in L_C_D_ screens , we should make 'em . And if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls
D :  Highly .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . But
B :  But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ?
D :  Yeah , but
D :  Um , s forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty .
B :  Oh , so still a little bit people
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah that's right . But you don't want to alienate the other uh
D :  No , that not now , but , so
B :  But if they also buy it then it's alright .
B :  I guess .
D :  Yeah , but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Alright .
A :  Okay , so L_C_D_ it is ?
B :  An Yes .
C :  Mm . It's treasure . I hope we uh h and let's hope to reach those uh those sales .
A :  Okay .
A :  And what else ?
D :  Yeah , i i if it Yeah , if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , can you um uh s I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens .
D :  N nothing , no costs at all .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But perhaps later , so uh
C :  Uh so if you uh Yeah , so if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder .
D :  Yeah , in
D :  I think that should yeah I think we all get the costs of everything .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I don't
C :  Because you are the the Marketing uh Expert .
D :  Yeah , okay , I'll I'll post it .
C :  I uh
B :  Well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive .
C :  Yeah sure , sure .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay . But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay .
D :  Okay , L_C_D_ , yeah . Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly .
B :  Yeah .
B :  The L_C_D_ ? Oh that's a bit of a problem .
D :  Yeah , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy .
B :  Oh , that's a bit of a problem .
C :  Mm .
D :  Tha i l i it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . Yeah .
C :  It's looks fancy one yeah , of L_C_D_ screen .
B :  Yeah , but they don't they don't like it . They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , just a the plain remotes , not not specific L_C_D_ remotes .
B :  Oh , alright , I thought that you said that .
D :  So
A :  Yeah , and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L_C_D_ remote , because it's new , as far as I know .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm yeah .
D :  Yeah , of course .
C :  And then not yeah .
D :  And then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap a lot , but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen . Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it .
C :  Um .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm . Okay ?
A :  Okay , what else does our remote need ?
B :  A mute button .
D :  Um
A :  Mute button .
D :  Mm-hmm . The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection ,
B :  I think . And
C :  Yeah .
D :  and power s power usage .
B :  Yeah .
D :  And a teletext , but that is not of the question . Other things are
B :  But
B :  But shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ?
D :  Sorry ?
D :  Yeah , it could be .
B :  Remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah , and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext .
D :  Yeah , teletext .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And there's also a
D :  And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , but
B :  Yeah , they are less important , but I think they should be there , or not ?
D :  Less important . Yeah , should be there , but not press Yeah , sub-menu , yeah .
C :  A sh but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . Uh I think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English , uh ,
C :  to not use batteries , and use ac uh bat uh batteries to uh to be yeah yeah sure . Indeed . So uh you can mount uh the the the uh
B :  Like with a with a mouse , you have not , yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , in a breath it's
C :  uh the remote control to um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Charted .
B :  We should think of the twelve fifty we have but
C :  to refill the
D :  Yeah , but we don't we don't have any costs now , so Yeah .
B :  I don't know how much that's going to uh
C :  Yeah . Okay , because i uh when you get an L_C_D_ screen , you run it on batteries , the batteries will be uh empty very soon , very fast .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah e e power supply is one of the most important things .
B :  You should Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
B :  You shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra , that you have t first you have to turn the remote on , and then you can uh I don't know .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh
D :  Yeah , I think it's it's not that easy because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it , so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down .
B :  Nee that's that's uh yeah .
B :  But then you can't
C :  And go to standby mode when you don't use it , so that
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah yeah au automac matically , that it yeah .
C :  Yeah , automatically . After two minutes or three minutes , something like that .
D :  Yeah . After two minutes , yeah two three minutes , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen .
C :  Yeah . Sure .
D :  Yeah . And then b that uh before an hour when its get again gets empty . Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger . Charger .
B : 
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  So we are going for the for the recharger .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , if it's .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh .
B :  If it's sensible .
D :  Yeah , because when you're watching T_V_ , you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger , and I don't think it
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , b when the batteries are low
C :  No , when you when you're done with s uh w uh watching your television , you have to put it
D :  Yeah , okay , but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours , six hours , five , six hours , then .
C :  Yeah sure , of course .
B :  But you'll also forget to put it in , because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember .
D :  Yeah , then you have a problem .
C :  Yeah , but
C :  But you also forget to buy batteries , and then you can you can't use it , so I
B :  Yeah . That's right .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So .
B :  Well I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days , or not ? 'Cause
D :  Yeah because you have b but you have L_C_D_ screen .
B :  Yeah , that's right , but
D :  High power usage .
C :  High power user cell , i
C :  uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore . Because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions .
D :  Yes .
D :  True .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  True .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
C :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , you made a point there .
B :  But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ .
A :  Yeah , also .
D :  Yeah , otherwise all your yeah .
D :  Just a small device . Plug it in , that's it . Yeah , like a like telephone charger or something .
C :  Yeah it hasn't It doesn't have to be big .
B :  Yeah . I think everything has it for and I guess .
C :  Yeah just just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that , just u
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Alright .
A :  Okay , well I've
D :  It has to be easy to use also , or things . Uh market share , speaker re speech recognition .
A :  Yeah , you have some more
A :  points .
D :  I think .
C :  Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points uh , or
D :  Also .
D :  Well I think that this should be standard . Large button large buttons . Yeah ? Okay .
C :  Yeah but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify .
C :  Because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons . Okay .
D :  .
A :  And you said something about speech recognition ?
D :  Yeah , it says also Yeah .
C :  Speech recognition ? Hello . Twelve Euro twelve Euro fifty .
B :  Yeah , twelve fifty , twelve fifty .
D :  Twelve . That's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent .
B :  So it's pretty big .
C :  Well , spread it by a big market .
D :  But then I I I
A :  Even bigger than for L_C_D_ .
B :  Yeah . W I know let's do a speech .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Ninety . Twenty five .
B :  You can clap or something .
C :  Yeah Yeah .
D :  channel .
C :  Turn volume up .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hey , that that's an idea .
D : 
B :  Now you shouldn't say the wrong thing , I dunno .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , well that should it has to be remote control , not
D :  Yeah , twelve .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , or ?
D :  Yeah . Is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . It's the only thing it says .
C :  Sure why not why not
C :  Yeah , mm .
B :  Oh , but do we want to implement that , or ?
D :  I think an L_C_D_ screen should be suf sufficient .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But when you look at the percentages
D :  Yeah , it says a lot , but
C :  Perhaps the options should be uh
A :  Speech recognition scores even higher , huh ?
C :  Why not ?
A :  Yeah , well , maybe because of the cost , but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh .
C :  Why not ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Let's hope uh to have some uh d
B :  I know
D :  No I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , and fifty five of those people want L_C_D_ screen and thirty five want speech recognition . So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen .
A :  But would it be useful to imple implement both ?
B :  Mm .
A :  On one remote ? Or
D :  Yeah , if the costs al allow it .
B :  Well
A :  Yeah , I dunno .
B :  I don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty . With that uh
D :  Nee .
D :  If it should be done , if it could be done , I won't matter . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , or ?
C :  We should do it . Yeah . Sure .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Uh .
C :  Certain systems already exist , I think .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . Then uh it's y it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English and
D :  True .
C :  True , yeah .
D :  Yeah . True .
C :  Yeah .
D :  But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . Because then I think in Chinese is different written , volume is different written than um Swahili or something .
C :  This should be uh accommodated with some software , uh , uh . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's right .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Right .
C :  Swahili . Swahili .
B :  Yeah you can use icons for the
C :  Yeah .
D :  Ja , well possible .
B :  a speaker and uh
C :  Indeed .
B :  But if that's better than language for the for the remote .
D :  Yeah , yeah yeah yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay .
B :  Then it's Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  'Kay , what else ?
A :  So , no speech recognition ? Or
B :  Well , if it could be done , we
A : 
D :  Yeah , we have to keep Yeah .
C :  Y it should be done . If it could be done , should be done .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , and then we have different languages .
B :  Yeah , that should be uh anything matters .
C :  That's not so difficult at all , because I already use on several voice operated systems , and they are all possible to uh not all , but
A :  Okay , just make a separate remote for each uh
B :  Well , you sh you should to adjust the thing .
D :  I think it's difficult .
D :  Every language of dialects
B :  Yeah .
D :  I think it's very differen difficult .
B :  And you have to speak the so that it can understand .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I think it can't be implemented , but maybe
B :  You could use that n as an option , if you have money left , or something .
D :  Yeah , 's an option , yes .
C :  Yeah , sure , indeed .
D :  Fifty Euro cents .
B :  Yeah . Let's do speech .
C :  For speech recognition .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so we only do this when we have enough money left . Okay . Well I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . Um or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_ and if there's enough money , speech recognition . And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm , yes .
B :  Yeah . I With uh teletext if it wasn't ver very important , it was but You also now have colours . I don't know if we should implement that . Yeah , when you press the red button , you go to page one hundred two , and when you press the
A :  in general .
D :  No , but
D :  Curved ?
C :  Uh yeah .
B :  I don't know if we should implement that , because it says that teletext not really important , but yeah , the shortcut , and you can't go to sport .
D :  Um .
C :  S Shortcuts . Uh .
D :  I think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  D Mainly if you turn the uh remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . And if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it . It should be available but not
C :  Sh Yeah , just just sub-menu . Yeah . Not directly uh available . Okay .
B :  'Cause it should be there .
D :  not Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , and
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  So actually it is there but it's just not r ready there .
D :  Yeah , but s
C :  Directly available . So does it confuse uh the user ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  You'll have to search for it .
D :  They'd have to be easy to use .
C :  Uh . I'll search um .
C :  If you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's a
D :  The sign of it .
A :  Okay , but no more buttons or functions , or ?
D :  Uh , no . What else can you do with a television ?
B :  I guess not .
C :  No .
B :  We've got anon
A :  Aren't we forgetting something very important ?
B :  Have got got two examples here , but I don't think there's anything we're missing .
D :  Uh play , pause , doesn't n need to be there .
B :  Well , we don't have the video orders
D :  Yes , so this is your presentation .
D :  We could check the other remote controls with technical functions .
B :  Yeah , you could look here all the the
D :  Which ones were yours ?
B :  Uh th th th th I don't know , technical functions . They're a bit small , you can we should stretch them , because
A :  Ping .
D :  Ja ja ja ja ja . Technical functions . Yeah okay .
B :  I guess we've got them all .
D :  Uh I think I go to have volume , mute but I Yeah .
D :  Very slow . Yeah , the zoom buttons .
B :  And for a T_V_ ? Can you zoom in a T_V_ ?
D :  Yeah , b wide screen , high screen , different things you have , yeah different uh Yeah .
B :  Or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and yeah . But that should also be a sub then , a sub uh menu thing .
C :  Menu .
D :  Yeah it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something .
B :  Yeah , so we should also implement se screen settings .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , screen settings , audio settings , teletext settings you have .
B :  Oh right .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Channel settings .
B :  Yeah , so you can program the
D :  So those four , and of course the main .
B :  Yeah , so the first you see the main , and the other ones you can uh go to uh
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Like tap screens or something or , I dunno .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Something
B :  I hope we can do this .
C :  There are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got . 'Cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the uh the screen settings uh for uh
D :  Yeah , if uh
D :  No , you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't then you don't use it .
C :  Yeah and if the television does not support such uh operations
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We don't have to use that top . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . So you leave it alone . Yeah . Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  And do we want them in different colours , or
D :  Yeah .
B :  And and the buttons , should they have colours ?
D :  Colours . Yeah .
C :  Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . I Because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g
B :  Oh but we don't have any buttons .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , then defines itself .
D :  Because uh how many percent ? Eighty percent ?
B :  They think it's ugly , right ?
D :  Would spend more money if it looks fancy .
C :  Okay , so use uh very uh lot of peo
B :  Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones . You can uh But I don't think that uh
C :  Adjust with phones , yes
C :  Okay . Twelve Euro fifty .
C :  Well , make it available in different colours , you mean ? Sure .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Red , white , blue , black .
D :  Rasta colours .
A :  And a see-through uh
C :  Grey . Yeah sea view , yes , Simpson's versions and
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , see through version . Yeah .
D :  If you press a button , it turns green .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , well that's the
C :  Leave .
B :  A disco version .
A :  signal for las final five minutes . Um so I have uh the things I just read . Um then we have uh separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ?
B :  Five minutes ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Channel settings ?
B :  Oh yeah , right . So you can program the T_V_ .
A :  Channel settings .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
B :  Perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile . So , options , and then you sub them . Otherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not , but
D :  Yeah . Could be possible .
C :  Mm .
D :  Or like uh you have a menu button , you press Yeah , or otherwise you have a menu button , press menu then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings .
A :  No , we said teletext also a separate menu .
B :  Yeah , but I
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . But
A :  Okay , but we can work that out later , I guess . So we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? Like uh large icons or small icons and
D :  Yeah , no problem . Yep .
B :  I don't know .
A :  I don't know what else , but
D :  Um , I think b because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen , I think the buttons Yeah , but but or like you have you only have channel button or volume button . Those buttons you can you can
C :  No .
B :  Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote .
B :  Which one ?
B :  But that's also in the L_C_D_ , right ?
A :  Yeah , but on the L_C_D_ , huh ?
D :  Yeah . Yeah , th
A :  Right , yeah , okay .
B :  So we don't have any normal buttons that uh No , alright .
D :  No , no normal buttons , yeah . Maybe only the on and o on and off button . But I don't think
B :  Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno
A :  But we don't need a special we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself .
C :  Uh not button
D :  Mm , no .
B :  No , no .
A :  Okay .
B :  Oh well , you should be able to set which T_V_ you have .
B :  If you have if you have uh
C :  Yeah sure , of course you need uh a settings button , uh or a settings option for the remote control .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ , that you don't have to use a
D :  No no no , because we we discussed that you could charge it , otherwise is it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically .
B :  Yeah but but not for the remote but for the T_V_ , that you use
D :  Yeah , but a T_V_ of course , th that's the I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . No .
B :  But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , yeah .
A :  Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . So how do you turn the thing on ? There has to be a on button on the remote , huh ?
B :  No you just tap I think .
D :  Yeah , you tap . Touch screen , yeah then it's turn turn off , turn on .
C :  Just tap it .
A :  Tap the thing . Okay . And then the television is on also , or just the remote ? Sure .
D :  No , just the remote . A television don't have to be on , that one you can press on , yeah stand-by , then press on remote , press on and then T_V_ should be available . Or not .
B :  But
C :  Yeah , it should be in standby mode , but
B :  Yeah a yeah . I don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button , a r just uh rubber uh for for T_V_ , so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel . Otherwise you I don't know whether or not that's
D :  Separate .
C :  A A A normal button on the remote control , or norm ?
B :  Yeah , yeah . To turn it on .
B :  Of or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Yeah , because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on .
B :  Yeah , I have , yeah .
A :  Okay , well
C :  Wh uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button ?
B :  Well I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you uh you you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want .
D :  Yeah , but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button .
C :  Mm .
B :  Oh right .
C :  I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control .
B :  Yeah , I think so too . Otherwise y wet e k Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all . Okay , well that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . Okay , well I guess we have to
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  If we can afford it .
D :  Yeah , if we can afford it . Yeah .
C :  Oh , okay
A :  postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , because we're running out of time . Um for now , we're having a lunch break ,
C :  Oh .
A :  and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work . I will uh write uh minutes , if I can create them out of this . And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder . And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles . And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach .
C :  Mm .
B :  Alright .
A :  Luckily as we are . Okay , well thank you very much , for now , and uh have a nice lunch , huh ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Lunch .
C :  Okay . Food .
B :  Should we put this back in our rooms , or uh ?
C :  Yeah , think so .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , welcome everyone to our next meeting . I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder ,
A :  which was quite some typing . Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . Okay , well
A :  I'd say let's start with the first presentation . Um in the same order as last time ? Okay .
D :  'Kay .
C :  W sure .
B :  Mm . Alright .
A :  Well , take it away .
C :  Okay uh welcome you all . Components design , um uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh elaborate some of the things I did . I I elaborated on the concept . What should be um
C :  uh said about uh the components , uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls .
C :  Uh well first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed . Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about .
D :  Don't destroy my giraffe .
C :  Giraffe's gone now . Okay um the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . There's one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option . But uh it's a very expensive material . Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh
D :  Drop it .
B :  Hmm .
C :  for our remote control . Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour . Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly . Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . But it's a very strong material .
C :  Um I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved . Uh so it's t two dimensional . I think it's uh it's best to draw oh green .
B :  It's a colour .
D :  Bright colour . Fancy colour . Forward .
C :  Uh
C :  New . Blank .
D :  You have to go t
C :  Okay .
C :  Let's make it uh black .
C :  Okay . I thought of an idea like this .
C :  Oh that . Um delete .
C :  Blank . Okay .
C :  So it also looks nice when it's on your table . So you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands .
D :  Oh it's a side view .
C :  Side view yes it's side view so uh I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling , but . Um uh it's just an idea I had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table . Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , which is uh is easy to clean too .
C :  One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff . And um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . Well I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and I think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . So uh
D :  True .
C :  uh that's all about uh the buttons . Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . Questions , ? Okay .
D :  No no no no no . Just looking .
B :  No .
C :  And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . And next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side .
C :  Uh my personal preferences uh I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . That was correct , wasn't it ? Okay . I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well , business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , so yeah , it needs colour ,
C :  Okay they should be m sh they should be in mind , wasn't it ?
A :  but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour .
C :  Okay so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan ?
A :  It must be recognisable .
C :  Okay okay . Well that's possible of course . We could make a little R_ and R_ on the top of the machine . Uh so they are pretty boring , I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people
B :  You can put the R_ and R_ .
C :  in which people will find they're uh interesting . And uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium .
C :  And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , because it yeah it makes sense . Okay . Well that's all about my uh my findings .
B :  Alright .
A :  Okay , thank you .
D :  Mm mm mm . Next .
B :  I will go next .
B :  Alright so I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look . And uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , so I had to uh look on that . And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of .
B :  Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . And so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name . This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer .
C :  Mm .
B :  Um perhaps it's useful , perhaps for because people um lose the remote , they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something . And perhaps we could uh implement that . And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like but I can't draw , so uh don't make too much of it .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
D :  It's true .
C :  Oh my God .
B :  I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw . I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . I don't know if there is an icon for the program , but yeah . So uh and then the buttons above and uh below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon .
C :  Not just a P_ . Oh okay .
D :  P_ yeah , just a P_ .
C :  .. .
D :  Where's where's the button for two ?
B :  Um .
B :  I forgot that one . I thought I forgot something , but uh . And uh and uh the numbers , that should be a bit larger I think it's not really on scale and and so forth . Um an options button . And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it's not really options , I think . It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing . So could call it settings or something . But this is a bit uh how I thought it . And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote . Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should ,
D :  Okay .
C :  Ah .
D :  Doesn't matter .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  No .
C :  Yep .
B :  so that it's better in your hand or something uh . But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that .
C :  Oh okay , yeah .
B :  Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of
B :  and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this . And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with uh this kind of uh And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things .
C :  Oh yeah , .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
B :  That's an option . And that was my uh finding dinge .
A :  Thanks .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Now our third
C :  Go Danny , go Danny .
A :  team member with his presentation .
D :  Okay , I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours ,
D :  material and stuff .
D :  'Kay .
D :  The method I used was
D :  Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . Findings I made . The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy .
D :  The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . And the third thing is it should be easy to use . I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use .
D :  The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff .
C :  Fruity ? Fruity .
B :  Grass green .
D :  Yeah . Like that . The round shapes ,
D :  and soft material m materials like the rubber . It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . Th
C :  Mm . Okay .
B :  Let's build it into a sponge .
C : 
D :  Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . They liked square shapes with round edges .
D :  And hard materials like wood , um titanium . They those kind of materials they liked . This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours ,
D :  innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like
A :  Oh y
D :  this or something .
D :  It's it's a bit like a banana . And the colour should be yellow , or something . And for the elderly people just plain old . Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ? Different colours , yeah . We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . Simple but
B :  It was one remote , I think , different colours .
D :  easy to use . So that's it .
C :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
A :  So for the older people , a more traditional uh form .
D :  That is my
D :  Yeah , like the older o older colours I can maybe
B :  You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . I don't know which shape you should should take , but .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Colours th the elderly people
A :  Yeah , I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh
B :  Yeah .
C :  Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ?
A :  the shape of it .
B :  Perhaps you could find something in the middle . Round but square .
C :  Yeah , s round corners , but s but square , yeah .
A :  But maybe then both groups won't buy it .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Uh i i if you do it uh uh square , with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i Do you know what I mean ?
C :  Yeah I know what you mean , kind of like a .
B :  wait , like like this uh a bit .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh
B :  round .
C :  Kinda like a beer glass . Yeah .
B :  So but then
C :  I know what you mean .
B :  Same sides .
C :  It's also easy to to have to to put in your hand .
B :  But that's uh
B :  Yeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped , so that's uh But perhaps that's a good thing , so that's easy to use . People know the
C :  Yeah .
C :  Will recognise that's as a remote control . Uh when I saw your d Oh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh
D :  Look something like that . Autumn colours like red , brown . They liked the wood a lot . So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . And a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things .
C :  Huh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , kinda like old cars , uh
B :  Yeah .
C :  Let's put it all together .
B :  Swords .
D :  Those kind of Yeah , those kind of things . So you see the big difference between the young people ? Fresh , exciting . And the old people , old and boring .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But that's easily to do with the colour , I think .
D :  So Sorry ? Yeah I think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape . Because otherwise we have to get different shapes , and colour way easier than yeah the shapes .
B :  That's easy to do with the colours , I think .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh .
A :  Yeah we think so too .
D :  In material yeah rubber , rubber is , like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood . So we have to decide if we're going to use
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that .
B :  Yeah think uh Also in between .
C :  Soft rubber .
D :  Yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it .
C :  Yeah I know what you Um .
B :  I don't think you should be able to mould it , but
D :  Or No . Or or wh what's something harder . No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in , or something harder .
C :  It should shouldn't be .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh .
B :  Bit like this kind of rubber . This uh
D :  Yeah , something like this , yeah .
B :  But it's quite hard , this .
D :  Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in . It's feels kind s spongy .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Spongy .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Something .
B :  I don't think it's rubber .
D :  No .
D :  N n n
A :  So we need a spongy feeling .
B :  Uh did you have something about uh
D :  Are you going to invite Sponge Bob , maybe he can
C :  Yeah .
B :  So we should first decide about shape , I think . Which uh Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it , and can decide uh .
C :  Ding ding .
D :  Yeah I think that's the better thing to do .
C :  Um I also s uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um .
D :  Yeah w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like
B :  Yeah it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit Yeah .
C :  .. .
C :  This was your size , but I think it should be larger .
D :  Yeah three quarter of the of the
C :  Yeah , three quarters . So uh so you don't have to put your oh .
D :  Yeah the buttons won't get that small when the L_C_D_ screen is
C :  Uh new , blank .
C :  So uh when you get this uh
B :  Ooh
C :  Uh kinda like this .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Or should it be larger ? Larger ? Because you want to put your hands You want
D :  Larger I think .
B :  But if you pu Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen . Perhaps that's best .
D :  Yeah becau because you have
C :  Yeah . Your thumb here .
D :  Yeah okay , true , true , true true .
B :  But not on the screen because Yeah that's uh that's an idea .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Looks a bit like a Game Boy now .
C :  Because when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll you'll always get some You Yeah . Going to be very greasy and stuff .
B :  You always touch it , yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
D :  But it won't get that small because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen .
B :  Yeah .
D :  One to zero , the two digit ,
C :  Yeah you don't want it too small . How yeah how large
D :  You have to you have to Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time .
C :  Yeah they have thick fingers . But if you wanna make it in international , Japanese uh people got uh rather small hands
D :  Yeah true , but Yeah , we have we have the zoom option , right ?
C :  and we got these large
C :  Zoom opt Ah yeah of course , yeah . You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , hey , we we want to do it with our fingers , right ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  No . Yeah .
C :  Your fingers , yeah . You don't want uh Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Y you could include a pen .
D :  Use a pen You you c you can lose the pen .
A :  Yeah but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they're used to that and
D :  Yeah the fingers , yeah .
B :  Yeah o yeah , if they think it's handy to use a pen .
B :  Yeah I think this uh this is a good size for the screen . I don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this , or something .
A :  And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but that that can be with plain soft tissue . Yeah , you can buy those at
C :  Yeah You can do whatever uh any uh cloth .
A :  Okay well maybe , if I can interrupt you , maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision .
C :  Sure .
A :  So we can discuss these points .
A :  those points um
A :  energy question mark . How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it . Uh chip on print and case . Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , but I hope you have ideas about them .
B :  I think energy were batteries and then uh and uh Yeah .
C :  The docking station .
A :  Yeah . So that's the the the first point . We already decided that on the previous meeting .
D :  Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station .
C :  W
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Just like with the telephone .
D :  So if the badg the batteries are dead
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  then you can re you can uh change them .
C :  I kinda like your
C :  Yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ? Mouse . Computer mouse .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah like those .
C :  Kinda like those kind of batteries .
D :  Yep .
B :  but it should be th I think normal batteries , not not like two or two uh
D :  Yeah , normal plain you No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Simple rechargeable uh batteries .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um what was with the chip on print ?
C :  The chip on print ? Um
C :  Uh you gotta f Yeah . I think so . Chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a
D :  Print plate .
C :  We also discussed that . Didn't we ?
A :  Yeah but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ?
A :  You still have a
A :  print plate .
C :  Uh
D :  Yeah yeah yeah . You always have a print plate .
C :  Beg your pardon ?
D :  You always have a print plate , right ? Always , so
C :  Yeah sure , of course , yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I dunno what w what we have to decide about that .
A :  Yeah well it's a good question . It just was in there and I didn't have any information about it , but
C :  Well uh chip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button . But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place , for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen , uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same . When you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , okay .
D :  But
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah okay , but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , so that that's not of any discussion , I think .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Well you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess .
C :  I suppose so .
D :  Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's
C :  It is a simple C_P_U_ but it doesn't
D :  Yeah yeah okay but I d I I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_ . Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ .
C :  Yeah because it has to uh b
C :  Yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume .
D :  Yeah , okay , true true .
D :  True .
C :  So it has to have some kind of a
C :  calculation unit or C_P_U_
C :  to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment .
A :  Mm-hmm . Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen . And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , we wanted to make it from rubber and uh
A :  Yeah .
B :  It's rubber . Yeah but but a hard rubber like this ? Or softer rubber or Yeah .
C :  Uh hard rubber I think . That's the easy to ha uh to to uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  It bounces back from the floor where you throw it . Yeah yeah this in different colours ?
C :  Yeah . Yeah sure , look .
D :  We have different colours .
D :  So the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ?
D :  No I don't think , I think
D :  it's more round than square .
B :  Yeah it's a bit . But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps .
D :  So it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people .
B :  Yeah . I think so too .
A :  Yeah . But that's what we want , .
D :  Yeah , that's our target . Yeah .
C :  It's our main target .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Lower than forty years , I think
D :  it was .
C :  Well and how about my idea uh of making it um
C :  with one single curve ?
D :  Oh yeah that that I think I thought that was a quite good
C :  So i
B :  Yeah .
C :  Because it's a gadget and you want to show it off , of course .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah yeah you have a fancy design , then , right away . So
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh .
D :  You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to put it get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in and . Yeah .
C :  Because it Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's a good idea .
C :  It's a lot easier .
B :  Yeah , alright .
D :  So
C :  So , so you got uh Did you write that down ? Uh got a single curved uh rubber
A :  Okay so
B :  And then
C :  f uh fancy coloured remote control .
D :  You can't you You can't oh , you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , you can uh It's pretty easy but
A :  Yeah but I wrote it down .
B :  And
D :  And load it on the the user the server .
A :  What about the user interface , there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that . You you showed your drawing .
B :  Yeah , I had what I just uh I should again .
B :  I miss a few buttons , but .
B :  Well .
B :  At least uh what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh
B :  if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now . This
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , you have to go back .
D :  Yeah uh uh .
D :  Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?
B :  I don't know . I think it's
D :  With the minus and the plus . I think it's
B :  I don't know . I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way , but I don't know what they think .
D :  easier than
D :  Yeah .
C :  Sorry ?
B :  Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ?
A :  Mm .
D :  For sound and channel .
C :  Depends on the screen . If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . If you make it uh in a rectangle
B :  Right well if we make it like this , I think if you
D :  Yeah .
C :  I so it's it's it's it's
B :  put it like this
C :  Square .
D :  I think it's it's easier to have it something like
D :  Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here .
D :  A minus here , plus over here .
C :  Oh , okay .
D :  And on here .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The other buttons and on here the top .
D :  The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here ,
B :  Yeah . But I think I wou
D :  and the sound .
B :  I think that's a matter of what you're used to . I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . And then the P_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle .
D :  Something uh
C :  Uh .
D :  Something like
D :  Sh
C :  Take your time .
D :  Plus minus plus uh
B :  Almost .
D :  minus .
B :  Yeah but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus .
D :  Yeah I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb .
B :  Yeah but I think Yeah I don't know . Perhaps I have some examples . I don't know
C :  We'll leave that to the usability engineering then .
D :  Who's the usability engineering ? She is .
B :  That's me . But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . The 'Cause they can use that better . Yeah .
C : 
D :  Oh .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um
C :  Consistency .
D :  Oh I have that those s numbers .
B :  I
B :  Here is our here are uh
D :  Or a good watch . B
B :  I don't really know .
A :  Everybody's searching in his data .
D :  Channel selection . Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . Volume selection four times an hour
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Uh
C :  So not how much n not how often it's used , but
B :  W what's what's usual or normal . Yes I'm looking here . But here's it's below , here also , and now here's here's next to each other .
D :  Yeah , that depends on on on the remote .
C :  Uh .
B :  I think it's it's a
D :  I think because I have two televisions at home . One is horizontal , one is vertical , so it depends .
C :  Yeah it does it doesn't really matter , but
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Depends .
C :  Uh .
B :  I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , because you go higher and down . And the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back .
D :  Yeah , lower .
D :  True .
B :  That's how it's is usually when I look here
C :  Okay , um .
B :  that's what I see .
C :  Let's cut to the chase .
D :  It's got to change .
A :  Yeah well I think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons just the
B :  I don't know .
D :  Yeah is it is user interface .
B :  Yeah .
A :  concepts .
D :  Component .
B :  This concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place a
C :  Okay , well le
C :  Yeah .
C :  Interface , yeah .
B :  And the speech uh shall we implement that ? Or uh
A :  Yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ?
D :  Yeah I think it's it's easy for that , where are you , but then it says I'm here .
C :  Technologies , uh .
C :  Yeah . Makes it possible to
B :  Yeah . But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . You can talk into the corner . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , a microphone , yeah .
C :  Not even necessary , because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh
B :  But
B :  Yeah , that's also .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Right .
A :  over there .
B :  So , in the middle or something .
C :  But that's not import I think that's not im very important because yeah , it doesn't matter where the microphone is .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  but you should uh decide where you want to put it . Right ?
C :  Ah okay , sure , okay , well tha
D :  Um I think where it isn't seen
C :  Underneath ?
D :  the most .
C :  Indeed . It shouldn't be uh very uh visible .
D :  Inside .
B :  You could p you could put it in a logo of the company .
A :  Yeah . Well maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out
D :  Yeah . I i between the round of the R_ .
C :  Yeah sure , why no
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it , because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control .
B :  Yeah . So where do you want to put it ?
D :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Well maybe where the one hand
C :  Yeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh
B :  Yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah bu but
B :  It's a way for you to uh
C :  Uh .
B :  So it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that .
C :  Yeah , okay .
A :  But are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ? Yeah because a microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote .
B :  About a microphone , there is no button .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I think the left s under corner should be the best .
D :  Where isn't i it isn't most in sight .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Well put it there . I don't mind . That doesn't doesn't really matter .
D :  I think .
D :  No . Actually doesn't .
C :  Okay . So ?
B :  Alright .
B :  Any more uh
A :  So well uh type , supplements ,
C :  Interface type .
A :  anything . Yeah , well we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_ and
C :  The L_C_D_ yeah , uh supplements well the supplement is to yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I think I thought the , like you said , like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy . I think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen . If you want to go back you have to back button go back , if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hey , .
B :  Um yeah . Yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah .
C :  Use the scroll . Yeah I think so too . So why not , on on side .
D :  Yeah ? You do like it ?
B :  Or at least Yeah I don't know if it's really the scroll , but the menu they like most , and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh
C :  Fast , yeah .
D :  Yeah I think it is is faster . Becau I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options , but if you don't have a lot of option then
C :  So if you've got a settings , if you
C :  Yes .
B :  But you have it's f uh we have five or four or something .
C :  You have a lot of options , because when you use Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down , you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah , okay , true .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay , no problem .
A :  And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch and
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah . It's also different .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Well there's our five minutes uh warning . Um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components , everyone ?
D :  Um .
D :  No , colours are clear , shape is clear , material is clear .
A :  Everybody think they can can
C :  Okay , what's the standard colour ?
A :  work for that ? Is there a standard colour ?
D :  And a standard , yeah we don't no we have different colour . How many colours are we going to
C :  I I You got you got different colours , but you should have a standard colour .
B :  You should you should have a black one because uh I think black is standard .
D :  Black . Yeah , black I think is is the standard .
C :  Black ? With the with the yellow uh
B :  But if you want to be different , then uh
D :  Dark grey , something like this this colour or something .
C :  Just a regular uh remote colour . And then have uh different covers uh to use .
D :  Yeah like like yeah . Or or silver .
D :  I think it's better to have silver nowadays .
B :  Silver .
C :  Silver , yeah .
D :  I think you see more silver than black .
A :  Yeah .
C :  You see a lot of t uh silver televisions .
A :  But still silver and black are well silver is new but also traditional , so uh
B :  Silver rubber .
D :  Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah . I think we have silver , black and between those is like I dunno s five colours between them or something .
A :  Yeah w what about a yellow thing , I mean it
C :  Yeah y I think it's better to
D :  Yeah yeah yeah it'll be a banana yellow , we have .
A :  could be ugly , but it's definitely fancy .
D :  R red .
B :  But yeah .
C :  Yeah th yeah . That's right . But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy .
D :  Green , wood , brown . Yeah .
D :  True .
C :  When you use titanium , silver is fancy , but when you use silver rubber , it isn't fancy . Silver has to shine , and rubber doesn't shine .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Especially when it's made of soft rubber like this .
B :  Yeah .
C :  You understand ?
D :  Yeah , I understand .
A :  Yeah I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue , just
D :  Yeah o of course . The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , dark red and brown .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Just all kind of colour .
C :  Fruity . Fruity loops .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Maroon . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , so
B :  And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh
B :  Is it
A :  Who's pinging ? You are pingin Okay . I thought we Okay , so uh that wraps it up ? Everybody knows uh what to do ? Well I wrote it down here . I wrote it down here what to do um . The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes . Um here are the individual actions , and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board , and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach .
D :  No .
C :  You ping .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well not what to do . Not what to do . Look .
B :  Well I don't know what to do , but .
C :  Okay .
B :  Ooh .
B :  Right .
D :  S tough .
B :  Yeah .
D :  We'll be available .
B :  But do we have to We'll work together , but do we have to stay here , or do we
A :  Well I I'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out . I don't know . Okay well that was what I had to say , uh ,
B :  Right .
B :  Yes . Okay .
C :  Thin I think we should work .
B :  Yeah I think .
A :  final thoughts from anyone , or ? We're finished . Okay , well thank you very much .
B :  No .
D :  No .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Finished .
C :  Thank you very much .
B :  So we have to keep talking English now ?
A :  Good .
C :  Beep .
C :  Oh .
B :  What ?
A :  So well uh welcome everyone . Um as you may have noticed I uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting .
B :  Yeah .
D :  That's new one ?
B :  We didn't make any uh
A :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , we should save that one .
B :  Oh in
A :  Then I'll move this one .
B :  Didn't we just do that ?
C :  Yeah , save in the folder . Save as project .
B :  Oh .
A :  Oh no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . And we have a evaluation left here . Okay .
C :  Oh , okay .
C :  Hmm hmm .
C :  Agenda .
A :  Well not main documents this time . Oh uh yes . I have it open myself I guess . Um well the detailed design meeting Huh ?
B :  Hmm ?
A :  We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . Um what are we going to do ? I've opened it already . Um I'm still going to take some minutes , and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ?
C :  Oh , sorry .
B :  We could .
A :  Aren't you ? Yes , you are . And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? Good . And we have a correct agenda . And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . Okay , well finance uh will be later . Now I'd like to give the word to you two .
C : 
D :  Yep . Yep .
B :  Oops .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Get up stand up . just 'Kay .
B :  Well uh we made a prototype . We first start with the overall uh
C :  View .
B :  This is about the total remote control . We made it green .
C :  Just example colour , so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype .
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's a fresh colour . And uh the screen light blue .
B :  Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . And the R_ and R_ logo , it just says R_ and R_ now , but uh
C :  Okay ?
B :  Any questions so far ?
D :  Big microphone .
C :  yeah , just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Oh okay .
D :  That's the place where it's going to be , not the size .
C :  Uh well , it's an idea in a so .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh
C :  Do not forget it .
B :  Uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  To function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course . The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . Okay um
D :  Yeah , okay . Of course .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Mm . Mm , th yeah .
D :  Small .
C :  we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um
B :  You push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a
C :  Yeah , you push the scroll button
C :  and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera . So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see oh , it's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible . Um
B :  Remote settings , et cetera .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . And you could also touch it so that it comes out , and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers .
C :  Yeah , that's c Yeah .
C :  Indeed .
B :  Yes .
C :  Okay , um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh Yes .
C :  In an apart uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  So a separate button for for text , okay .
C :  In a separate button , yeah .
B :  Yeah . Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah .
C :  A sign , yeah , just like Okay , indeed . Okay , we can uh modify that later . Okay . Would you like to make any comments about next uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Forgot .
B :  Uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen . Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . We put ano an an extra button in . We can erase it , but It's the button where you can switch channels . just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . Yeah , that one , yeah . It has a name . And uh uh we put that in , I thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers button . Below that , the page and the sound . And uh in the middle the the mute .
C :  Previous page , yeah , indeed .
C :  Oh my God .
B :  Uh battery indicator . It's it's a bit big . And this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop .
C :  It's quite large .
B :  Or at least it should look like it . And the options uh of teletext .
C :  Okay . You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very uh when you uh when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu .
B :  Huh .
C :  'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down , so
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . Well this about it , I think .
C :  Okay . Huh .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Thank you . Looks good .
B :  I will put it back on the on the nice green .
A :  And I just missed when I was typing The R_R_ stands for ?
B :  That's the logo of the Yeah . It's th th right now it's only R_ R_ , but uh
A :  Logo , okay . Okay well
C :  Full screen .
A :  I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course .
D :  Shit .
B :  Yeah . Sorry .
C :  Alright .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Okay , the evaluation criteria , huh ?
B :  Oh full screen , yeah .
C :  Huh .
D :  Evaluation .
D :  'Kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire
D :  by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . My name , my job , okay . The methods .
C :  My name , my job .
D :  Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps .
B :  Right .
D :  One means absolutely not true , seven means true .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are , is the remote control fancy enough ,
C :  Sorry , you used the PowerPoint
B :  Yeah .
D :  is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use .
D :  And then evaluation itself .
D :  Uh .
C :  What ? Bling .
D :  So .
D :  Okay . First question . Is the design fancy enough ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well
D :  Project Manager , what do you think ?
A :  Well it's looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , huh ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  But does it
D :  Yeah .
A :  Only what happened to the single curve
A :  we spoke about last meeting ?
C :  Now uh the single curved idea was uh
B :  It uh oh it's in the background . Oh .
C :  Yeah , okay , you ge um
B :  Y you should make uh a sideways uh view .
C :  Yeah . The sideways view , uh that that that ma
B :  It will be , I guess . Oh , we can
C :  Ho not that pen . Not that pen .
B :  Oh g I would smart board . Uh can I draw here or uh
D : 
A :  Well it might work one time , huh .
C :  Suppose so .
D :  Think .
B :  Ooh .
D :  Yeah , yeah , you can .
C :  Ah . Oh my God , it works .
B :  So it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , right ?
C :  Yeah , that's the single curve indeed .
B :  Yeah .
B :  So if you v flip it like this .
C :  Yep .
A :  Okay .
B :  Here's yeah .
C :  That's not very i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there , so uh
B :  Yeah . So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , so that it lays a bit o
C :  Yeah .
D :  Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ?
B :  Yeah , that's a bit of problem maybe .
C :  No .
D :  With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , so if you could
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , indeed . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . 'Cause otherwise I think i
A :  Okay , but we have to rate uh these things now ? Okay .
D :  Yeah , we have to rate . Is it fancy enough ? True is one , false is seven .
D :  So fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people .
B :  I think it does . I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it .
C :  I think so . It's pretty fancy .
D :  I think
D :  Yeah , I have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , it's only design .
C :  you get th
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I think it does .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And the design .
A :  Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . I don't know whether older people will use it , but
A :  Very new thing . Well
D :  So
A :  Fancy the old people will .
B :  I would make it a two or something .
D :  A two ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  It's true , it's a one . Very fancy .
B :  Huh ?
B :  Alright , it's a one . Oh it's a one .
A :  No , it's a two . Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ?
D :  Yeah , I n used I wouldn I should use that one , but it doesn't
B :  Yeah .
B :  But it's a one uh Maybe uh
D :  Okay , no it's two ? True is a one . Very true , is it very true or isn't that true ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Well I'd say two on a scale
B :  Well they think it's very true , but uh
C :  It's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , so
D :  Yeah , I think two .
B :  Yeah , but
C :  It's very fancy , I think . Have you ever seen a remote control like this ?
B :  We should perhaps
A :  No , okay well , that's true .
C :  No , okay , so so it's fancy .
D :  That's fancy enough .
B :  That not .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Then ?
A :  Okay , one two . That doesn't matter that much , so make it a one .
D :  Okay . Let's give it a two . Is it innovative ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  I think it is , because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone .
D :  Enough .
A :  Yeah m
C :  And uh uh the scroll is rubber , so s
D :  We have for the search function .
B :  It's from rubber . Yeah .
D :  The scroller a bit I think it's it's a one yeah .
C :  Eno enough to I think .
B :  It's a one I think .
D :  True .
D :  Also huh uh-huh the buttons , are they easy to find ? That was a big requirement of the old people .
B :  Yeah , because they're right on your screen .
B :  So you can use the b the the arrows .
C :  Huh .
B :  They're right on your screen , so I don't know where you'd search . Yeah .
C :  With the ones
D :  Are all the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons , all the buttons .
B :  Well , I think they are .
B :  The options are it uh little bit harder , but if you touch the options then it's uh
C :  Yeah .
C :  Take a harder look , yeah , sure .
D :  I think th it's
C :  It's easier than the regular uh remote control .
D :  easy t
D :  Yeah , I think this is easy now . I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to
A :  Yeah , and you use these buttons the most , huh ? So
C :  Yeah .
B :  No they're not , but they're they're they are easy to find .
D :  to handle .
D :  True .
D :  I would rate it a
C :  Yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button . So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most Yeah .
B :  Oh .
D :  Yeah , okay , that's true , that's true .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So which
D :  But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text .
A :  So which number are we going to fill in ?
C :  I think it's uh it's a two , at least .
B :  I would say yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , you can make it a two .
A :  A two , yeah ? Two , three and what do you think ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  It's not perfect , but
D :  I think it's a three .
C :  A three ? And why is that ?
A :  Okay , so we have two , two , three .
D :  I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy .
B :  Yeah , but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . You can touch it . Yeah .
D :  You can touch it .
C :  It said bo both the options .
B :  You you can touch options .
D :  Yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , right ? Okay , then okay , good . Then I think also two , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  You can touch options and it's comes out .
A :  A two , okay , because we have to
D :  Yep .
C :  A two , a two .
B :  The uh the um Below .
A :  It's the box below it , huh ?
C :  Uh the next question the next question . Oh my God .
A :  Otherwise we have two results in one question .
B :  It's different .
A :  Okay , next question .
D :  It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people .
B :  For young people I think it's easy to use .
D :  Young means sixteen to forty years . And elderly from forty eight to their death .
C :  Yeah , I was uh Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think it's
C :  I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . Yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh
B :  In the entire mankind .
A :  Okay , you're very enthusiastic about your own design , huh ?
D :  Also if you're sixty years old
C :  you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen . So it's t I think it's really easy to use . You want these options to
B :  Yeah .
A :  As well for the for the older people ?
D :  Yeah , as well as your if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand
C :  Uh sure .
B :  Yeah , but uh
B :  Yeah , but they they don't want the uh extra options , right ? So
D :  No , but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , so it it it has to be
A :  And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ?
B :  Yeah , okay , but so they could
B :  Uh I think it is . If they read a manual .
A :  Because that might Yeah . Okay , well
D :  If you read the manual , always .
C :  Perhaps that is one of the most uh
B :  Yeah , alright .
B :  Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult . You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the question and the answer . And that's everything it does , the speech recognition .
A :  M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use .
C :  Uh because a lot of
C :  Channel one , channel four , yeah .
A :  Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think it would make it uh
C :  Yeah , I think it does . Because all the people who can't uh
D :  So
B :  I would make it two .
D :  Also two ? Not a seven for this ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh a two . Sure , two . Oh .
B :  Three ?
A :  I'd say three .
D :  I would also say three .
C : 
B :  Oh . You ?
A :  Okay , so we have three three two two or
C :  Two .
B :  Oh . Well
A :  So what are we going to do ? Okay , a three , I see . Uh
B :  Two and a half . Three ? No .
C :  Give me more .
A :  Another question .
D :  Remotes overwhelmed with buttons .
B :  No .
C :  No .
A :  No .
D :  No , that that's that's yeah . Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one .
B :  But um I mean , that's definitely one .
C :  That's definitely our uh
B :  Oh nee , oh seven is it ? It is . Yeah , uh the remote score .
D :  No ? Oh yeah .
C :  A false , yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results , so
D :  Yeah , I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed .
B :  It's not overwhelmed .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , indeed .
D :  True .
A :  Okay , a one , because we designed for that , huh ?
B :  Yep .
D :  Remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups .
B :  Yes .
C : 
B :  'Cause we make them in different colours , so that they uh
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , is optional .
A :  Yeah .
D :  That's true .
A :  Yeah , and I though w we had about single colours , but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , can't you ?
B :  Yeah . That it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah . Uh I think you can .
C :  Huh .
D :  Also with rubber ?
A :  Whether it looks like wood , it isn't w it isn't wood but
D :  Yeah , okay .
B :  It it feels like rubber , but
A :  You can make a print on rubber , can't you ? Yeah . So that's a one then , huh ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah ?
B :  Well but then when you scratch it it does come off .
D :  That's a one ? Okay .
C :  Yeah , it is it is harder to
B :  So that's a bit
A :  Do you have many questions ?
D :  Uh I have
C :  to like
A :  Oh , okay well
B :  Oh we have time .
C :  Geez .
A :  Yeah , but we have We also We have to get to the money .
C :  We're getting paid . We're getting paid .
D :  The material used is spongy , that that's uh that's a one , that's m rubber .
B :  What ?
A :  What spongy .
B :  Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . Oh but not it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber .
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah , I th think it's not the most spongy thing .
B :  I think it's a three .
C :  Yeah , it's a three , because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible , because it has a L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh-huh , yeah .
B :  Hard but
B :  Yeah . You can break it . Yeah .
D :  Remote control is hard to lose .
C :  Hard to lose , yeah it sh and it's easy to find .
B :  Y yeah , you could you could call it .
D :  Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it .
B :  Yeah , y you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose .
D :  It isn't hard , no . I think I think this is a two , personally .
B :  Two . That it's hard to lose ? Yeah , it it is there's the it's a six , you think ?
D :  No .
C :  Isn't hard to lose .
A :  Yeah , so isn't hard to lose you .
C :  Isn't hard to lose , yeah .
D :  Isn't hard to lose .
B :  So it's a two . Yeah , you can lose it , so I don't you can make it a three I
D :  Yeah .
D :  You can't lose it .
B :  It does have an a built in function .
D :  Or if you're you're sixty years old , your demands
A :  Yeah , but a har
A :  A hard to lose is good . So it should this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it .
B :  Nee .
B :  Hard to lose . Oh right .
C :  Yeah , this this is hard to lose .
B :  It is hard to lose . Yeah , so then this is it is almost true , so a two .
C :  This
A :  A two .
D :  I think yeah , I think also .
A :  A two .
C :  Two , yeah .
A :  Okay .
B : 
C :  And most all because of the option to Whoa .
D :  Huh ?
B :  Ooh .
A :  Yeah , it's okay . That happens above also . But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal , but
B :  Oh .
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah ? Oh , okay .
A :  Yep . Oh , it isn't , well okay . Remember .
D :  No .
B :  Oh well , it doesn't .
C :  put the cor cursor on the .
D :  Okay okay okay . Remote control mainly be sold to younger people .
C :  Click .
C :  True .
B :  I think it will , yeah .
D :  Yeah ? True ?
C :  True .
D :  Very true ?
C :  Uh yeah . Uh
B :  Uh well I a a two .
D :  No , I don't think very true because the colours .
A :  There .
D :  We have the colours . Um we have the buttons is aren't that that much .
C :  Materials , yeah .
D :  Nah , the material isn't that
B :  It's it's much more younger .
C :  Uh okay . So ma uh make it make it a two .
D :  So I don I think I think it's a three .
A :  Well I think it's it's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , didn't we ?
B :  Yeah . I think it's a two but
D :  Yeah , but I uh
D :  Okay , okay . I think because yeah ?
A :  What do you think ?
A :  Questions ?
C :  A two ? I think it's two . I think it's two too , two too too .
A :  Two .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  Two two two . Let's make everything a two .
D :  In the features ?
A :  Dissatisfy younger people . Um
B :  Younger people . It has
C :  Well perhaps not .
B :  What did
D :  Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing .
B :  Yeah . Well that it doesn't .
C :  Well , n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , but it's for a remote control I think it i it would satisfy those needs . Yeah , the speech possibility , the colours .
B :  Yeah bu but
B :  I think they like the speech .
B :  You could call to your uh yeah , and the screen , yeah .
D :  L_C_D_ screen and scroll .
C :  Scroll options , yeah .
D :  I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations .
A :  Yeah , but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something .
B :  Right , that that that those are features .
D :  No .
A :  It has relatively few features , with
D :  It's three features , basically , the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature .
C :  Yeah .
D :  The microphone is a feature .
B :  No , aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , and that you can change the options of the remote , uh uh something like that . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Ours had other features with
D :  I think yeah , and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings .
C :  The easy volume up button .
B :  Those are features .
C :  Remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . Turn uh turn up the volume .
D :  Yeah yeah . So I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one .
B :  Enough features ?
D :  Personally , yeah . I think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll
D :  thing extra .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , you think one , what do you think ?
B :  I think two or three .
A :  You . three , yeah . I'd say three , so two it is then or
C :  Two .
B :  Yeah . Yeah uh a two a two . Just another two . We like two .
D :  Make it make it a two .
C :  One two three .
D :  Or make it uh a fucking two . You can see the remote control is R_ and R_ .
C :  Right .
B :  Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front . Uh it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ .
C :  Uh .
A :  Yeah . Yep .
D :  Has oh yeah , do did have nah y you have the black one . And we'll probably make also a yellow one .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but not R_ and R_ yellow I think .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , maybe maybe two . Well m th but the logo is on on the front , so a two , yeah , that's
D :  Maybe two .
C :  Okay , true , yeah .
B :  One d on i it's the colours and the
D :  X_ marks spot . And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use .
B :  I think it is , but I don't know what you think .
C :  I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained .
D :  Yeah , tha that's so true .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , uh
B :  And you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal T_V_ uh remote .
C :  Yeah , you can navigate .
C :  Uh .
D :  I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . No , I'm not not convinc . Let's go th for I think it would be a t yeah , two . Now lower .
C :  You're not satisfied , okay . Let's start over again then .
B :  Yeah . Let's make a different remote . Well
B :  Menu .
B :  A two ? We only have twos .
C :  A two .
A :  Oh , well that's that's pretty good , huh ?
C :  Oh yeah , I think so . Yeah .
B :  Uh just twos . One three and a few ones .
D :  So okay , we have one three , a one , that that have to got up .
C :  And three .
B :  Two threes .
D :  Two two two two two . So two , yeah . The average is a two . That is quite good
B :  We m mostly have twos , so it's pretty good .
B :  Yeah .
C :  The average .
B :  Yeah . I think so too .
D :  in my opinion .
C :  Yeah , I think so .
D :  That
B :  We can be happy .
D :  Ooh .
C :  Save .
D :  Ooh .
B :  Yeah . What is it ? It's like a bug or something . A fly , yeah .
C :  It's a fly .
C :  Oh m
B :  A f butterfly .
D :  Top .
B :  Yeah .
B :  That's it .
D :  Okay .
A :  That was your evaluation uh show , okay , so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . Okay , good . Um let's see oh , it isn't asked to save but it did already
D :  Yes .
B :  Sure .
D :  No , it's two . The average is two .
B :  It's good . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Exactly .
D :  Yeah , I uh uh I uh saved it .
A :  And this
A :  Everything okay . Well , the next part uh might be a little bit
A :  difficult to do
A :  in a group , but I am willing to try it .
A :  Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Redesign . No .
A :  And um I'm not sure if I put it in the project folder . look on that . Um and we're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty ,
C : 
B :  Yeah .
A :  we're good , and if they're not we're going to uh re-design , but we have to do that uh very very quick I think , yes . Um I don't know if I
B :  Yeah .
B :  So we're going to erase features or something .
B :  Do you have the cost or uh
A :  put the Excel sheet in the
B :  Let's hope . We're going to be here at eight o'clock .
A :  n not in the
D :  f fifty five Euros .
A :  folder . I think it's
A :  I think it's still in my own documents folder .
B :  We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock .
D :  No .
B :  I doubt it . Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet .
A :  Oh shit .
D :  Yeah mm yeah , maybe .
A :  So
B :  No , it was in my uh my information , so uh
D :  The microphone . Yeah ? maybe you're going scrap scrap it .
C :  Yeah . It i It wasn't too much .
B :  Yeah .
C :  As well as the L_C_D_ screen . Whoa .
A :  Okay , well this is it . Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes , and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions .
B :  Well , if it doesn't work
B :  I want to fill it in , but uh
D :  No prob .
D :  Ah .
B :  But you should uh direct
D :  Count it ? Li like write it be
A :  Well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things . But you have to fill in this column , huh ? No , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens , so
C :  Count it . You got Excel to count .
B :  The number of
C :  Oh okay . Well I dra uh Danny , Danny , I'll do that , because I draw the uh
D :  Ah , okay , cool . Huh ? Yeah ? Oh , yea yeah , you design it . Um
B :  We've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , huh ? Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ?
B :  Yeah . I would do a battery we do . Right ? A battery . One battery , right ?
D :  Solar cell . No it took a battery ?
A :  We'll wait .
C :  No , no solar cell , no no no no .
A :  Yeah .
C :  No hand dynamo . Hand
D :  Yeah .
B :  Electronics , simple chip advanced chip , right ?
D :  We have
D :  No , we have sample speaker . But b al but we also have sample speaker , do
C :  On advanced chip .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah , so this one and this one .
B :  Uh we ha we have um single what ? Are we ? Oh yay .
D :  Oh , we already on nine .
D :  We have double curved .
C :  Single nee single curved . Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . But it isn't three dimensional , it isn't curved in a l
B :  The single .
D :  Single .
D :  This one is
B :  Oh the the it's not going to work uh people . We have rubber .
D :  This one is curved like this , right . It's curved like this .
A :  I'll just fill it in .
C :  No no no , single curved is like this . Uh that's the only curve you made , not th uh curved like that . That's uh
A :  Um rubber indeed ?
D :  Yeah , bu what
D :  Oh , but we have curves like it and it . There are two curves , right ? Oh , okay I understand , I understand . Rubber .
B :  Thirteen ?
C :  Huh ?
B :  With a scroll wheel , right ? Is he integrated ? No , eh ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  I don't know .
D :  Push button . No , we don't have push button .
C :  Yeah , we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s
B :  Oh yeah , right , we want it to it's not it's not no . Yep . Fifteen , oh , too bad .
D :  L_C_D_ display .
C :  Not going to work ? Okay .
C :  Okay um
B :  Oh but with special colour we have . A special form , right ?
C :  But now button supplements . We don't got the button supplements .
B :  Oh , we don't have any buttons , so Yeah , we need to uh
D :  Eighteen and a half , damn . We have to lower it with six points .
C :  Damn .
C :  Okay .
B :  No , uh we have fifteen and oh , right .
D :  Twelve and half .
B :  We could lose the curve .
C :  Nah .
D :  We could use
B :  Yeah , I would lose the curve .
C :  We could lose the scroll wheel . You could make it just a regular scroll wheel .
B :  But you can't push it , so you have to tap .
C :  Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button .
B :  Yeah , alright . So normal scroll wheel ?
A :  Yeah , I think that will be
A :  our best bet .
C :  Normal scroll wheel .
B :  And I think we should lose the curve .
D :  I think we should scrap the sample speaker . It's four pri it four units .
C :  Lose
B :  Yeah , but if you would i it is a new feature , it it's something special .
C :  Okay , so we don't exactly need the single We don't need a curve . 'S possible to lose curve .
D :  But w d wha
B :  No , the curve doesn't really
D :  Curved then it will be square .
B :  No , then it will won't uh stand up from the table . Then it would just
D :  Was that does that mean to it , single curve ?
C :  Okay . Yeah , that's meant with scr uh with s curve . The curve is uh in a dimension . If you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  So
B :  We would lose this one ?
D :  Yeah , but tha that that only is one .
B :  Yeah , we could s yeah , a bit .
C :  No , two .
D :  No , one .
B :  Sixteen point three .
C :  Oh , okay , indeed .
D :  So we don't Yeah , we also have to
B :  So we still
C :  Is it possible to make
B :  Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ?
D :  No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen .
B :  No ? Ma y you just can't do that , or uh
C :  No .
A :  And what did you change ? You changed the uh scroll wheel and
B :  We changed th
B :  Yeah , and the single curved to uncurved .
D :  Single curved . Flat .
A :  Oh , but it's just one
D :  Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think
A :  point , so maybe you should should uh
B :  No .
D :  Scrap sample speaker ? That that's uh
A :  Yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition .
C :  The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points .
B :  Yeah , but it's t
D :  Yes , four points .
B :  Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , it is something special .
A :  And then you can keep the curve .
A :  Or can't you ?
C :  Yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the
D :  Yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? F You have to we have to scrap four points .
B :  I don't know . Yeah , that's difficult .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Or make it on a hand dynamo , but I don't think that will work .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ?
C :  No , that's no . Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ?
B :  Uh .
B :  We could make it titanium instead of rubber .
C :  You don't make a remote control of Ah .
D :  Yeah , it it i Yeah , it also uh it also takes one point less .
A :  Yeah , mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , yes ?
B :  Oh . Oh can I ask something ? What is special colour ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Is that the wood uh wood uh this , we have to have that one too ?
D :  I think it is .
C :  It isn't .
C :  What ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but it's only a half . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker .
D :  Yeah . Sample speaker .
C :  To knock the sample speaker , yeah . And sample sensor .
B :  Th then we still have too much
D :  Yeah , okay , three . Point three .
B :  if we use the uh
C :  But m yeah , course , but What we'll have . Let's make it thirteen or fourteen .
B :  Yeah , we we scrap that one ?
D :  Huh ?
D :  Point twelve .
B :  See , a po three . We need point three .
D :  That's a scroll wheel .
B :  Uh it's a colour . Don't make it wood .
C :  A colour .
D :  Yeah , but a wood we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood .
B :  Make it uh
B :  Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it
C :  Yeah , special colours , fruity colours .
B :  a all kind of colours ? It's also green or uh
D :  Is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours . Normal colours , yellow
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . You don't say here's green rubber .
C :  Yeah .
C :  They don't sell green rubber plants . Alright .
D :  Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half .
B :  Yeah , you can , you should you have to lose
D :  But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh
B :  No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess .
C :  No no no .
D :  s advanced chip .
D :  No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? Five ? Then we have two .
C :  If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen
D :  S touch .
B :  A push , yeah .
C :  then it's possible to make . And then you can and then you can add to the colours .
D :  Then we can make add two colours on it . Yeah , two colours it .
C :  Special c Okay , if you lose uh if you lose the
B :  Switch colours .
B :  It was such a great idea .
C :  You lose this one , you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example .
D :  They can add two colours .
D :  But the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told ,
D :  is that all the colours we add or
C :  How d uh uh how many colours ? Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p
B :  What do you mean ?
D :  Yeah , but we we we are we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium .
C :  Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour .
B :  Oh . But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , 'cause you have to add it .
D :  Ah okay .
C :  I suppose .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black .
B :  Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . You co you could make it always black , like normal remote .
D :  Yeah b
D :  Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow uh red , and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now .
C :  Nee we we also want to make ano another colour .
B :  Oh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . That's what it means .
D :  Yeah , but m
D :  Yeah , because we have more colours than only black .
A :  Yeah , but isn't it per remote that you pay ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  I then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special
B :  Oh right , yeah . Is it per remote ? Yeah .
A :  Half ?
A :  I think you pay half per remote . So each remote with a special colour .
B :  Yeah , that's right , and you one colour per remote . So then it is one .
C :  Yeah , indeed , yeah . You don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote .
D :  Yeah , okay okay , true .
D :  True , true .
B :  No .
A :  I hope .
D :  We have two points spare . Nee one point .
A :  So the battery , we have um advanced chip on print .
B :  One .
B :  So it would be curved , single curve .
A :  Because of thing Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again .
B :  Or not ?
C :  Hmm .
B :  So y you just can't make a nice remote .
C :  Yeah , single curve .
A :  Because that was very important , huh ?
B :  It's too bad for the speaker .
A :  So it's curved , it's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker .
D :  Mm yep .
B :  Should we change that tha that that's a one if not , or not ? Could you copy it ? And make it uh
A :  We dropped the scroll wheel .
A :  And the rest is the same , huh ?
D :  Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped .
A :  Am I right ? Yes .
B :  The entire uh
C :  Uh . Huh .
D :  Yep .
B :  Perhaps you can then copy page or so .
B :  Ooh .
B :  No . Oh you you made the entire could you
C :  Okay .
C :  Undo , undo . Undo .
B :  Oh not Well .
C :  So , 'kay . Twenty minutes ?
B :  Would you ?
B :  By the Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . Add it copy page .
B :  Select all .
A :  No , but you c yeah .
B :  Alright , something went wrong .
D :  Tap .
A :  Okay , but this this new remote we can afford .
B :  It doesn't work . Let's forget .
D :  It should've work .
C :  Okay , so you had this list at start ? Alright . When did you receive this list ? Ah okay .
A :  Hmm ? No , I hadn't . I just received it .
B :  Yeah . Oh ignore that .
A :  They don't work so hard at the finance department .
C :  Ah okay . I suppose this is a
B :  Well , so
C :  Okay , so we lose the scroll wheel , the s
B :  Too bad .
B :  Yeah . The microphone .
A :  Yeah , and that's it .
B :  Yeah . A and we changed something , I guess , or not ? We
C :  And the microphone .
B :  Oh no .
D :  Yep .
C :  Okay .
A :  Twelve Euro fifty . Um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ?
B :  Yeah , I tried to copy that one , but it didn't work .
A :  It didn't work .
B :  So we could fix it like tha that it's like this .
A :  Hmm . Strange .
B :  You could select it all , but then you can't erase .
C :  Strange .
A :  Oh , you can arrange
C :  You can only re erase ? Oh .
B :  Erase . When you saw th li uh Earlier when we selected it , w I couldn't erase anything .
C :  Uh , no .
A :  Hmm , can't you then just say copy ?
C :  Bling .
A :  New page .
A :  Paste . Yes .
C :  Ah .
A :  Select none .
D :  just tap somewhere .
B :  Just tap somewhere .
C :  just up somewhere b uh besides it , right .
A :  Okay , and now you can erase .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I don't think I can , but uh we can try .
C :  Uh , we already try .
A :  Well it should be possible .
B :  Oh , yeah , no , ha-ha .
A :  Oh no .
A :  Well you can draw over it with white uh pen . Oh .
D :  No ?
B :  Yeah , we tried it earlier . It's very much work .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Sorry . Well but that's also useful for the evaluation , because I think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh
D :  Evaluation drops .
A :  design . Doodle . And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time .
D :  And erase the mic .
B :  Yeah , goodbye mic .
C :  All I need is no mic .
A :  Let's see , we can save this now .
B :  Oh , I already erased half of the line .
C :  Bon chance
A :  And move back to here .
B :  Too bad , oh .
B :  Like this ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Still looks nice .
A :  And then all green . Okay , well thank you .
B :  Oh , that's erase .
D :  Looks like a iPod .
A :  Oh , no .
C :  No , add
A :  Hey , but you can erase that .
B :  Yeah , that's a bit weird . Oh , now I'm line .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uh-oh .
C :  S Difference between lines and text and the pen .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
D :  Oh . All I need is mic .
A :  And you can't erase this ? Hmm , strange . Okay , well uh just leave it at this and quickly save . Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . We just did our project evaluation . Um well , I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide . Um
B :  No , it's weird .
D :  Station page .
C :  Huh , looks fucking boring now .
A :  what did you think about uh the process ? How satisfied are we ?
C :  Deadlines were sometimes very short .
B :  Yeah . Bu but stressful . You think , no , my presentation isn't ready .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But And stressful .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . Now we worked through each other , something he said yeah , and you had information I also had , so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told , so
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And you could ask things .
B :  Yeah , you had information I didn't have and then uh
B :  Oh right .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ? And uh
B :  Yeah .
D :  So yeah , that I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project .
A :  Yeah .
B :  No .
A :  So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work .
D :  Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate .
C :  Yeah , but but why not work here together , for example ? Why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , you could
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well , probably to simulate the whole working uh process , huh , th you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks .
B :  I think so too .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but then you can work together too when
D :  Yeah m yeah , like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something , but now we're completely separated from each other . I don't think that was the best way , but
C :  Huh , oh right .
A :  No .
B :  A chat would also be uh
C :  But the technology was uh fantastic .
D :  Yeah , the technology's okay .
B :  Well , I I don't really like the board , it doesn't really work great . Sometimes I think .
C :  Work now ?
D :  Yeah okay , but I don I do I think becau that's because
C :  Perhaps it is e
B :  It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh
C :  Yeah , perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there . So you can draw uh see it over th on the screen . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , like the f like a plotters or something , yeah . Yep yep yep yep yep .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful or
B :  But
C :  It's useful , but not m
B :  Well it is useful , but it doesn't really work all the time . Th the pen doesn't
D :  Yeah , it is useful , but
D :  No .
C :  Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below .
B :  The line is a bit off .
A :  Yeah , so it's maybe a bit unnatural also .
D :  Yep .
C :  Alright .
B :  Yeah , you can point to where you want the line to be .
B :  But
C :  The project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have , you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh
C :  qualitati qualitative uh presentation .
B :  Yeah .
C :  So you used uh this
C :  uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the
C :  Oh .
A :  That wasn't me . Uh so um the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about uh this digital pen ?
C :  Wasn't me .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I
D :  I didn't use it at all .
B :  I I used it , it it was you can use it , it's quite handy I think .
A :  Yeah , well I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer , huh ?
C :  But I didn't I uh
B :  Yeah , I used it to y to Yeah , it did work pretty well .
C :  I used it too , but oh well .
D :  I didn't use .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I don't think why you would want to use it actually , but it it does work .
C :  Yeah , because it shou
D :  No yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  To make some designs , it is very easy .
D :  It is it is yeah , it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , and then you can show it to everybody .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But to write it th yeah .
D :  Yeah . It's b bi little bit too big to write .
B :  It doesn't really write normally . It's a bit
C :  Yeah , it's too big , it's too fat .
D :  Yeah . Fat document , those .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , um
A :  and what about the teamwork ?
D :  Team work was okay .
B :  I think it was great , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , well I think so too . we
D :  Only thing that we worked through , past each other . With some things that was only problem , but
C :  Right .
A :  Yeah , but that was it was our assignment , huh ?
B :  Yeah , but it was because we didn't uh Yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah , but furthermore better .
A :  Okay , and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership .
D :  That's yeah , no prob . Ah .
B :  I thought it was good , but uh Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah well , okay .
C :  Not too much , not too too too too .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  And creativity ? Well , when we look at this I'd say we have been creative , huh ? But
B :  Well .
C :  Yeah , or the room for it was the idea to be creative , so
A :  There was room for
B :  Yeah .
C :  You got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And you get get stuff from the from the computer , but
C :  Yeah .
C :  The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late or
D :  Little bit uh lo yeah . Too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  You just sit there for ten minutes . Yeah , where is that email ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  I played I think seven times Solitaire something .
A :  You did ? Well , I didn't have time for that .
B :  Oh did you ? Is it on there ? Is it on there ? I didn't find the didn't look but uh I didn't look , but
A :  At some times I Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment , and then
D :  Oh right , it is there .
C :  Was searching and searching .
D :  No , I I never got that . I always
B :  I got like one email after ten minutes or something .
D :  N yeah .
A :  I even got spam . Or something like that .
B :  That's what we said .
D :  So does this I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think , sometimes , in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do .
B :  And it not a lot uh
B :  No , the first one . I didn't know uh
C :  No , w I didn't know
D :  Yeah , like I with with the remote and I never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control .
C :  Make a r yeah .
B :  nee .
B :  And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , so I went , right . Yeah . Just looking at the screen and uh
D :  Yeah , so
C :  Yeah .
C :  No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page .
A :  And I was working and working and work Okay , well um but after all we can say uh we are satisfied , but it it could've been uh better . When we get uh when we have we would have gotten uh more information .
C :  No .
D :  So , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm . Faster .
B :  Yeah , an
C :  Yeah , more information about the costs .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that will be handy .
C :  First of all I didn't think uh that we were able to make an L_C_D_ screen uh first point , but uh it was possible uh uh , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , it only costs four units . Uh yeah .
B :  Yea uh so tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that was a bit mean to put it in the end . And uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Uh , I dunno .
D :  Um
D :  Yeah . Nothing .
B :  Think that's about it .
B :  Hmm . Heavier um less heavy laptops . Yeah .
D :  I think we got it already .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh . Faster laptop .
A :  Yeah , they're pretty heavy .
C :  Uh . They were they were just fine .
B :  But that's not really uh
D :  And furthermore the the the network was okay . Everything you loaded was also
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh .
B :  Yeah , everything worked .
D :  av available there .
C :  Right .
A :  And so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work , is what you say . Okay .
D :  So
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , but that
D :  It's now half past four half past three , so
B :  Yeah , but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone .
D :  Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay .
B :  Then it pops up pop up screen came . Five minutes in the meeting . No .
D :  Mm-hm . Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Okay , so more time during the individual work phases . Um okay well uh I just got my warning for the last five minutes , so I'll move on to I guess my last slide , yes , which is the closing . Well uh , we managed , but we did it very quickly . I don't know if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it , but we had to do it , huh , because we have to have a design , and that is within the budget . And we evaluated . Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project . And I think uh everybody's uh very happy . At least I am , with the results , so uh celebration , well , for the three of you , because uh I have to write the final report now . But uh well , thank you very much for your co-operation , and I had a very nice day so far . Okay .
B :  Huh .
B :  You did ? Well
B :  Oh , right . Well
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Champagne .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , sure .
D :  No prob .
C :  Oh thank you .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Do we get another email ?
C :  Bling . You're fired .
A :  Um
D :  I think you do .
B :  I I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again , but
A :  Yeah I have t I think we also have to go to our own rooms again , but um well I at least . But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this , so I can try to include it in the final report .
B :  We do ?
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh th that that one ?
C :  You cannot you can save it .
A :  Yeah , maybe . wants to , but at least this one . I know , we should remove this , but it won't h
B :  You can just Yeah , but it's it isn't a picture or , well , is it ?
C :  You s uh file save as the J_ PEG J_ PEG .
A :  Okay . And uh please put it in the project folder then , huh .
D :  Can you find it as a J_ PEG ?
B :  No , isn't possible . But you can make a screen shot , I think .
C :  No .
A :  Okay , well I uh
D :  No .
C :  No .
A :  I hereby officially close the meeting and uh I hope to see you uh soon .
B :  Yeah .

D :  Six hundred . No , I yeah .
C :  No that uh is one thousand twenty four .
