C :  Okay .
D :  Or you get it . Okay .
C :  No I don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length .
C :  Okay , and then .
B :  So we uh we will wait for Anna , a few minutes .
C :  Yeah , s yeah , um .
D :  Mm . Yours is well
C :  I think you can put anywhere you want , actually .
D :  Yeah but the the mic should not
C :  I thin
C :  It's not a directional mic , anyway .
B :  I think it should work like this . So I will try to get my presentation running .
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm . Can't help you with that .
C :  Last .
D :  Okay , it's y yeah .
B :  It's no matter .
B :  No problem .
B :  Ah yes .
D :  Right .
C :  Okay .
D :  Then press uh al
C :  Okay .
D :  This . You know ?
B :  I don't know . Just try .
C :  'Kay .
B :  On this normal
D :  Oh oh .
C :  Alt F_ five .
B :  Good . Doesn't appear on the screen here .
D :  Right well
B :  Oh .
D :  Wow . Amazing . It's working .
B :  Okay . Thank you . Uh .
A :  Hold that .
B :  Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your
A :  Okay .
B :  Somewhere .
A :  Okay . Mm .
B :  So , good morning , everyone .
B :  Um
B :  Welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project . I hope you all have been uh updated about it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Good .
C :  So . Yes .
B :  So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here . Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . See what our roles are in this project .
B :  So , um
B :  We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh
B :  to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w
B :  we will also try to uh
B :  to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . You all know I hope how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Total .
B :  Uh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh
B :  wh what uh what our new product should look lite like . And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting .
B :  So . Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um
B :  We When you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original . Be uh we want to be distinguished , mm ? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . So it needs to be trendy . I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product .
B :  But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh
B :  be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that .
B :  So , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um
B :  You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh
B :  then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the uh
B :  ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design
B :  and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape .
B :  Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training .
B :  In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh
B :  notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a
B :  a a a white-board .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And um well it should work uh I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so
B :  Um
D :  Under documents in the shared folder . Okay .
B :  Yes . Do Do we have to say something about that ? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh .
D :  Yeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . And uh , yeah .
B :  Yes well we will then find out ho how it works .
D :  Yes .
B :  Um .
B :  Well , this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet .
B :  So , we'll come to that later .
B :  So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here .
B :  So ,
B :  I would suggest uh
D :  Each of us is going .
B :  Well , yes , um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . I I'm not really sure how this works , but
D :  Okay , shall I start ?
A :  Mm . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , you can start it you know .
B :  Yes , a good idea Mael .
A :  I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down .
D :  So , i
C :  No they will record through that . There's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make .
A :  Mm . Mm .
A :  But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  'Kay .
D :  But it's
D :  Actually , I think I cannot go with uh
B :  You you
B :  D doesn't it work ?
B :  Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna , maybe you can start . Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I have to draw .
B :  So um
B :  L Why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board .
A :  M my my favourite animal . Sorry this is all tangled up here .
B :  Oh , I see uh
A :  That's better .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yes . Mm .
B :  So draw it . We will try to guess what it is .
A :  Mm-hmm . I'm a very bad drawer .
A :  Weird .
A :  Um . You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing . I'm a bad drawer . Okay .
B :  Mm .
A :  They're ears , by the way . No . Um close though .
C :  's a cat .
A :  Okay so like a pet animal .
D :  Okay .
A :  Like a cat .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It's like a cat , so I guess it's a cat .
A :  No , not a cat though .
B :  What is this now ?
C :  Ah you forget about it .
D :  You're on the knife .
C :  Yeah , uh I think it's fine . I just don't want to carry it off .
C :  Man , this wires , eh ? We need a wireless microphone .
C :  You know ? Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that .
B :  So , that's the cat . Oh .
A :  Okay . So . It's not a cat , it's a dog . Yes .
D :  Mael .
C :  So .
B :  It's a dog .
B :  So but that's also kind of cat , isn't it ?
C :  Oh the dog doesn't have a tail ?
A :  It's got a tail then .
B :  B bo both predators .
C :  Yeah , sure , yeah . I thought so . The dogs have a tail .
A :  Yeah yeah .
A :  So do cats . And you guessed cats without a tail .
B :  So , thank you . Uh d did you uh work out cord ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think I will go without without it , right ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  It'll still not extend , right ? It's not up to that .
A :  Okay , there you go . So what favourite characteristics . Uh . Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun .
A :  A horse ?
C :  It's a horse .
A :  This is why you're the designer . And I'm marketing .
B :  Yes . Yes , yes this is Yes definitely a horse . Yes . Oh very good . So
A :  Ah
B :  I suppose it
C :  Ah I think you can put that .
A :  Mm-hmm . That's it .
A :  A blue and black zebra .
B :  Yes .
B :  Can you can meet them in Africa , I think . Yes . Very good . So
A :  The very rare blue zebras . Yes .
C :  I'll tell to get it off my
B :  Ma Matthew ?
C :  Uh ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So
A :  You got a lot of room here . You can probably reach .
B :  Maybe
C :  Oh y it's not for that .
A :  No ?
C :  No .
B :  I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael .
C :  Okay . Yeah .
C :  So what should I draw ? Mm .
C :  He has already to do cat .
A :  I took a dog .
A :  Um .
A :  A mouse ?
B :  This looks likes a cat who has been driven over .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , right ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , the moustache .
D :  So
B :  That's that's definitely a cat .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh yeah . And i Th They like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this .
B :  It's quite , you know relaxed situation . Yes .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , okay .
D :  She has the small legs .
B :  Th thank you , Matthew .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Thank you , Matthew . Perfect .
A :  It's a very big rat . Or a very small cat .
D :  Oh a rat , okay .
B :  Yes , this is certain uh
B :  some contribution to our project . So . Let's see . Which animal has not been drawn yet .
D :  And you ,
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Your turn .
B :  So you've all drawn land animals , so why not draw an animal from the water .
D :  A bird . Okay , in the water .
A :  Ah I don't know what that is . It's a bit
D :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  It's a bit hard to guess .
D :  Yeah . Put it colours . Maybe it would help us .
C :  So
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ?
D :  With different pen widths .
A :  Mm-hmm
B :  So
A :  Oh , it's a shark now .
D :  Ah it's a shark , yeah .
B :  Oh , yes , why not ? Good idea .
C :  Ah it's a baby shark , it looks to me , you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ?
A :  Mm .
D :  Oh .
A :  Now it's a swordfish .
B :  Why not . A swordfish .
D :  You have some in in Australia , right ? Yeah . I dunno .
A :  Swordfish . Um , maybe .
A :  I've never seen one , no .
D :  Oh well .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I hope it still works . So
D :  Perfect . So I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually But uh
C :  You should go for the next one it seems to me .
B :  W Well , this uh this tool seemed to work . Let's continue to uh to the real stuff .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , exactly , yeah .
D :  Wow .
B :  Um our project uh finance uh
B :  thing . Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when
C :  Twenty four .
B :  designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh People uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um
D :  Per remote control , yeah ? Per project .
B :  product .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yes . Okay . Um more interesting for our company of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things . Uh we will try to uh
B :  to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America ,
C :  Ah yeah , the sale man , four million .
B :  maybe some uh Asian countries .
B :  Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents .
D :  So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics .
B :  Yes , of course . Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit , huh ?
C :  They have to sell at least four million to make a profit
D :  Of course .
A :  Mm .
B :  You all have to be paid .
A :  Mm .
B :  Excuse me ?
C :  Ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . Fifty mill
D :  Oh you're g very good in mathematics . Four million .
A :  Yes .
B :  Yes , indeed .
B :  So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , I think .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So , that about finance .
B :  And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly .
B :  Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Of course it should have a on off button .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , s and it depends what application you are using it for . You might need uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  We wer we were thinking television . Uh .
A :  Mm .
C :  We are targ targeting the television set . So , you need to record the channels . You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way ,
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , yes . Th th that's very handy I I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels .
A :  Mm .
C :  Uh
C :  And
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Uh , and
D :  And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we You are the marketing guy ? Or th So you are the marketing . And you are in the u use user interface uh design . So just yeah I wanted to to be sure . And I I'm the the industrial designer okay . Because I I don't know you very well , actually , but yeah . Okay . Mael . Happy to meet you . Okay . It's very uh
A :  I'm marketing .
C :  Marketing .
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Sure .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
C :  Oh .
C :  I'm Matthew . You know . Matth s uh Anna . And um uh Matthew , yeah . I thi think you know me , yeah ? right yeah .
A :  Anna .
B :  A and I'm Nanne .
B :  So
D :  Uh so yeah uh Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face .
B :  Yes .
B :  So . Um
D :  So mm
C :  So .
B :  S s
A :  Mm .
B :  Are there some other very important things to to do well ,
D :  So I
C :  So
B :  to specify in this first phase of of the project . So the browse function , as you m mentioned .
A :  Mm . Yeah . Oth yeah .
C :  And uh ,
C :  you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then you uh Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so
B :  Yes . Yeah .
B :  Yes .
A :  Mm .
D :  Like what ? Like internet on the on T_V_ ?
C :  Yeah I_P_O_ or . Now we are looking for
A :  Mm .
C :  television things or I_P_ . For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Ah it's it's it's it's coming up , actually . The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up .
B :  Mm , well uh I I think
D :  Actually , yeah w
B :  Uh w y you two should should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality .
C :  Let's Let's take
D :  Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . Um then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_ . But before
A :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But
A :  Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use .
B :  Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh
B :  w we can leave that out , I think . So twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know , you you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know .
A :  Mm .
A :  So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to
D :  Yeah , but w w we want to design a new one . Mm .
C :  Yeah . No , it's okay , yeah I understand . So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things and then um
D :  Yeah .
D :  The Yeah , the main is browsing . Yeah .
B :  Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting .
C :  Okay .
B :  So
C :  Okay , we are alread mm . Mm .
D :  Okay .
B :  So you know now the basic the basic things . And
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  well just just for the next meeting , um
B :  well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . So
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  you will be working on on
B :  technical function design , so
C :  Yeah , sure .
B :  And uh you and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , eh ? Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  basic basic television uh interface .
C :  Stam .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So , uh
B :  I think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  Perfect .
B :  So next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh . K keep it in mind .
C :  Okay .
B :  So I see all everybody's here , 'kay .
D :  Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And we can start meeting .
C :  Okay .
A :  What's the agenda for this meeting ?
B :  The I will uh
B :  present here agenda with with with with slides
A :  Okay .
B :  to you . Um
B :  as you can see here .
D :  Perfect .
B :  So first uh just to mention I will
B :  take notes uh of this meeting and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you . I've also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Next .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um .
D :  So y you are the secretary also . Right ? Okay .
B :  Yes . Indeed .
B :  Um .
B :  Then I hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . Um . W We will uh in a minute we will uh start with them . Um , we will see in which order we will handle them of . Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . Uh Um about the functions and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group
D :  Perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  and the functionality of the
D :  You mean the social target group who we wants to target ?
B :  Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this , the customers , indeed yes .
A :  Mm .
D :  Oh the customers , okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Think that's that's important matter .
A :  That's the big question yeah .
B :  Uh . So And then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch . Good .
B :  Um .
B :  Maybe um
B :  why uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? You don't have presentation ?
A :  No , I don't . I wasn't .
A :  No .
B :  Uh you want a table to to uh
A :  I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything .
B :  Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um .
A :  Mm-hmm . Well I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . Um .
A :  It's probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it . Um basically it's saying that
A :  users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Um .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Um . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Uh . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that .
B :  Mm .
A :  Um .
B :  Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said ?
A :  I have an a web page yes .
B :  Yes , mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh .
A :  Yep . Yep , sure .
B :  Uh about this .
A :  Mm-hmm . So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . Um , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour . Um , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . Um . Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . Um .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . Um . Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps .
B :  Yes yes , I have that too .
B :  Mm .
D :  It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's
A :  Um .
A :  Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . Yep .
D :  Okay too much time to learn . Okay .
A :  Um . And thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . I don't know how we'd go about combating that . For R_S_I_ ? Respet Repetitive strain injury .
D :  Not enough
C :  . What do you mean there ?
C :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
A :  So . But
B :  They think that or do their doctor the doctor says ? But it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh ?
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . That's what the report says yeah . Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown on
B :  So mm .
D :  Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the
A :  Uh I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now .
C :  You can disconnect it there no ?
B :  You can maybe just just
D :  Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file okay . O otherwise you yeah .
A :  Oh no , yeah .
A :  Yeah . Um , s hang on .
C :  Then you can connect this one or this one yeah .
D :  You can connect this one .
C :  All to your computer .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well .
D :  So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  Oh I need to muck around with this . It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . It's just a web link .
D :  Yeah
B :  Hmm .
C :  Okay .
D :  Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account
C :  Hmm .
D :  for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design .
C :  Yeah .
A :  One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute .
D :  Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep . Um , one thing is interesting is talking about
A :  um speech recognition in a remote control .
D :  Speech recognition in
A :  And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful .
B :  D do you have numbers o o on that ?
D :  Ah okay .
A :  Yes , I'll just get this up .
D :  So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech . Okay .
A :  Well potentially yeah , um
A :  I think even for interesti yeah I think that would not work so well . You wanna have both options .
D :  Interesting idea .
D :  Okay .
B :  Well it would it would be a solution for uh when your
B :  remote control is lost , I mean when it has speech recognition then
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  uh i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . But the these are all quite fancy features I'm not sure whether
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well it would be f
B :  we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  No you can't .
D :  And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ?
C :  Oh .
C :  Well , it depends you know like
C :  there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off ,
B :  Mm .
C :  one , two ,
D :  But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting .
A :  Mm .
C :  twenty three , yeah . It's it's going to be li it's not going to be s so easy but
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yes , that that that that's mm .
C :  u usually it's going to be more of an isolated
B :  Do you have some more important facts or
C :  case but it's but I don't know with twenty fi
D :  Okay .
A :  Um
B :  can we go to the next presentation ?
D :  So you had to to to summarise maybe the
A :  Well
A :  This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um .
A :  Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . Yeah . But we sh Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , um , which we'll be talking about later I think .
B :  Mm .
C :  Okay it's uh decline . Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm . Decline with age , mm .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Yes . We will talk about it later . Okay .
A :  Did you get the email ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep , that one . Just follow that link .
D :  I thi You us yeah yeah .
A :  It'll be in a different window , yep .
A :  That's left that one .
A :  Yep .
D :  Okay perfect .
D :  .. .
A :  Mm . So that's the figure that I was just talking about there , with the different demographics . Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that .
C :  Okay .
D :  Mm 'kay .
B :  Mm . Okay . um
B :  Uh maybe uh Mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm I okay I stay
B :  Oh , this is
C :  Now you can move I think yeah .
D :  I can move as far as
B :  Mm-hmm , y y you can move , uh .
D :  Maybe I take your chair ? I okay .
B :  Yes . You can you can sa take my chair .
C :  It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , go to the .
A :  Sorry ? Oh .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer .
D :  And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control . Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important .
A :  Mm .
D :  So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed . And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna and um
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design . So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want . Uh we want an on off button , it can be uh it's simple but it's it's important , and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , right .
A :  Mm .
D :  So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver . This is very quick uh design , uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And um so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this uh schema that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me you know . And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components .
A :  Well .
B :  Uh-huh .
A :  You drew it a long time ago ?
B :  Is huh
A :  Ninety one .
B :  overwhelming .
B :  No .
B :  And and why do you want these kind of component ? I mean , are they cheap , or are they uh reliable ? What were your
D :  So .
D :  So the the main components you see here are the cheapest I have found and
D :  yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive , but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so
B :  Mm .
D :  yeah that's it for the working design , uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components but maybe yeah
B :  Yes .
B :  It it
B :  it's more clear now I think .
B :  So
C :  But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma
D :  No no no no we we will uh This is a preference but we can always change uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver , I mean can you can you get back to it ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah uh , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it . So we we must adapt to the to the receiver . I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh .
D :  Of course yeah .
D :  Yeah . We will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh
D :  and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm .
B :  Yes . Okay .
D :  Um . Okay .
B :  Thank you .
C :  Well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies .
D :  The frequencies ? Yeah yeah . Of course yeah in the chip you have it yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But you should be careful , people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . So maybe we should think of yeah .
D :  That can control o other things .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Ah .
D :  Of course yeah we should take that into account in the uh
B :  Yeah yes I I I
A :  That's handy . So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off .
C :  Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things . Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew . I I I assume you were finished here . Uh okay .
A :  I like that idea .
C :  Yeah so .
D :  Yes .
C :  Okay . So I can take I think mine now there . Okay so voila . Hmm I can take mine it's okay , voila , mm so mm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  Oh . I
B :  Uh , sorry ? I know where it is .
C :  It's on the desktop .
B :  It's uh
C :  Technical function . Okay .
B :  Yes .
B :  It's uh
C :  Like so . Well . So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
C :  basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and uh um a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later . But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yep .
C :  And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but uh uh . Then there is uh this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing , um which which you can vouch .
C :  And then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And then whi which is generally used by the people . And then well personal preferences I would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with
A :  Okay . How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? or does it know which one you want to use ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option and you could play it or You can also think about having like um
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program . In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm mm mm mm mm .
A :  Mm .
D :  These are kind of next generation functionalities .
C :  It's the next generation thing , but it is going to come in couple of years . It's goi
B :  Mm yes , but I think it's i i it's already there , I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah it's
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . So it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing .
D :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  That's fair enough .
A :  Mm . But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . That's , yeah .
C :  No no we are not making a universal remote , we are just looking at uh giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm . Because y
B :  W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects yes .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah . So
B :  But it's good to keep in mind .
A :  Mm .
C :  Okay so that p ends my presentation .
B :  Mm . Very well .
C :  Well . So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . And it basically you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . And thi this is going to come .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Good .
D :  Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed uh online uh yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie and
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah so .
B :  Um ,
C :  Yeah .
B :  so u um I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you . Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  That's that's especially because of the internet of course . So we should think about it um . Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh
A :  Hmm .
B :  on the remote mot control itself .
A :  Mm .
B :  Uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . Um
A :  Mm .
C :  Um .
B :  further yes we must think , uh do we stay uh to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh huh , or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices ?
B :  Uh indeed indeed . And and and the hard disk recorders .
A :  So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? Mm .
B :  Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  and our our current customers are mainly forty plus uh which well Forty .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Fourteen or for O okay . So
B :  So that's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older older and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . Um therefore ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  younger people like trendy trendy designs , so that's w we should
B :  make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but
B :  it should also be uh have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh
A :  Mm . But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , that's the the the mm the new and the funky things , that's , yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . That's
C :  Yeah so .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Yes yes mo
D :  Because they are already used to that , you know , product . Yeah .
B :  Yes it's recognisable
B :  Mm mm .
B :  And and they are skilled uh by using it .
A :  Mm .
C :  So for example uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well uh
D :  .. .
C :  Okay , it works . Fine . So , for example you have uh presently uh keys like one , two ,
B :  Mael can you hand me over this uh ?
D :  Yes .
B :  Uh thank you .
C :  three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  uh keys like that
A :  Okay .
A :  How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all and it's a very important issue .
B :  Mm well I think fi five min Mm-hmm .
C :  Forty minutes ?
C :  Yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so .
C :  too sorry , so we basically don't change the uh original order of them but then the keys are more spacious , they don't look uh so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , uh four , sorry four here uh five and six , so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice for you don't have too many keys but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
B :  'Kay I I think now that the idea's clear . Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group .
D :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . Which I think is quite tricky . Um , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Of course they have already one . So our our our remote control has to be better .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But it's not going to have more functionality , 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm . I well I think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh
A :  Mm .
B :  uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one but
A :  Yeah . But why are they buying one in the first place ?
B :  Indeed .
B :  So that will be about
B :  functionality
A :  Mm . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality .
B :  Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm .
B :  So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance
A :  Well , we can't , with the price range . We We're not building a universal remote , we're not building a high end product .
B :  What do What do you think about What componen
D :  Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_ and I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps and uh we can include it in our control some new new features . Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  And um But yeah that's
A :  But yeah .
A :  If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that which would drive the cost up a lot .
B :  I don't know . I don't know whether that's necessary . Is the L_C_D_ screen
D :  I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well , th for long term .
A :  For universal remotes
A :  If you mm .
B :  I think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive .
A :  And quite complicated to use , yes .
B :  S so we can try to go in between , and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as
A :  Mm-hmm . Not as flexible maybe , yeah , but s yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh
D :  Universal .
B :  R_C_ because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on .
B :  Mm yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group .
A :  Okay . So they're yeah .
B :  People yes . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yep .
A :  I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? I don't know .
B :  Uh well
D :  Mm .
B :  I think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So d Do you agree ?
C :  Well
C :  Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive .
D :  Yeah because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is uh price of a chip is very cheap . So I'm okay for designing um a ne uh less yeah a a kind of universal uh R_C_ yeah .
C :  Uh and it d uh
C :  Our provin
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm . You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Um so
B :  then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control .
C :  Uh yeah , that's that's what we needed basically .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm . Mm . Okay .
C :  Uh that's needed right now . And uh basically you can look to the standards of other
D :  Yeah that's needed , yeah . And if we want to get the market , we really need that .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ .
D :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Exactly .
A :  And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them .
D :  Is that okay for you ? Yeah .
B :  Mm mm mm mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So given we are going for this uh
B :  uh universal type uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market .
D :  Yes .
A :  Mm .
C :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm yep .
C :  Voila .
C :  Hmm .
B :  So anyone uh has a point to bring in or shall we no .
C :  So .
C :  Well .
C :  Oh I don't have anything right now . We can we'll we'll go and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good for the
D :  Oh that's that's fine then .
B :  Okay .
B :  W yes , we uh we can have lunch now . So um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah so we meet in well what are our
B :  Then th
B :  th the next meeting will uh after lunch you have uh we have
B :  uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting . But you will be informed via the computer . Okay .
C :  Okay . Cool . So see you later .
D :  Okay perfect .
A :  Right first time this time .
A :  There we go .
A :  It's not that complicated , but I get it wrong every time .
D :  Okay so we are just waiting for Matthew .
A :  For Matthew , yep .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh
B :  So I suggest we start the meeting uh without Matthew uh he's uh obviously late for some reason .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm 'kay .
B :  Good .
B :  Um .
B :  Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design .
B :  I hope uh you both did some uh some work uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  concerning a uh conceptual design . Um this will be the uh agenda for
B :  the meeting uh . Uh I will
B :  take some minutes uh again . Um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
D :  Yep .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So and that uh will uh we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So um who has the fir do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready ?
A :  I have a presentation , I'm just making this
D :  Yeah I think yeah the Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here because
B :  Okay .
B :  Ah there is Matthew .
D :  it's really a a team uh project with a team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's okay it's good .
C :  Sorry .
A :  Okay I'll just email you this file , my presentation .
B :  So .
B :  Good .
B :  Do presentation ready ?
A :  Mm-hmm I'm just emailing it to you .
B :  Oh okay .
C :  So
B :  So did you manage uh
C :  Yeah I sent you the slides , you didn't see them ?
B :  Oh yes I see him , good yes .
C :  Okay .
C :  .
B :  No .
C :  So
C :  'Kay .
A :  Okay it should've gone through to you .
B :  Okay mm yes I have it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . Um can I just put this on ?
A :  So we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it .
A :  Um .
A :  This is to do this I will not remove my microphone .
A :  We basically used um some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um , and as part of this
A :  The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . The most important by far was the look and feel of it . It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . It needs to stand out . It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . People will wanna buy it . Um
A :  That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want . That's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again .
A :  Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , it has to be easy to use . So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um .
A :  Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . Um I had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . That would make it stand out . Um .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  So can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ?
B :  Spongy feel ?
D :  Uh about the feeling yeah uh yo
C :  You can
A :  Well ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart , rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  So as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . So going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um .
A :  Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . That's one way of looking at it um .
A :  Textured feel we just talked about . Maybe it's another way of doing that . So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever . Um and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah that's a very good idea , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . They're big selling items . People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas .
A :  Um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , uh that's one thing we could look at . There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't
A :  I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . I think we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And
A :  use . I had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves , and then yeah and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yes well maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Voila .
A :  Yep and that's the presentation .
B :  Okay good , that's very clear .
D :  Yeah very clear .
C :  Yeah .
B :  'Kay .
B :  Um .
A :  So does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? I think you
B :  Uh
B :  Maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel of uh I've it was a good idea maybe to to
D :  To let the people choose , you mean ? Yeah .
B :  Yes the the the there are changeable covers , but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational
A :  Hmm .
A :  Well we're selling so many units of this . This is gonna be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least .
B :  Hmm . Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah a range of uh yeah , a set of three , four different aspects .
B :  Yes .
A :  Mm mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Sure that fits the
B :  Yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh after-sales I mean that would would be very good I mean those covers could go for for three , five Euro .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  That's a very good idea um
B :  And then uh
B :  maybe uh we can go a th Matthew's presentation because
C :  Yeah s then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  the
B :  Together indeed uh , because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use , what you were already mentioning .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah yeah I agree .
C :  It should be easier with that .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So
D :  And your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah so I'll I'll go with that actually so um
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay so m so then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , and uh they could be like buttons or like and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button .
C :  So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do . So what I have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have and uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like You can basically if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm . I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . That's a good idea .
C :  Yeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly , even if you arrange it by however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to
D :  .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm . Yeah I really like that idea .
D :  So what functionalities do you suggest for that ?
C :  So it it it's like it limited one . In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel . Yeah some ten twelve channel information . You know you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that .
D :  For facing this problem ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Maybe ten channels , yeah at the most .
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  And uh basically uh it depends like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is now , so I am using the T_V_ so
C :  every time I use it , it could be like , for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , to model the functionalities will increase actually , and for you and you might want you don't want separate keys for all of them . You can't .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh yeah yeah yeah mm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
C :  And uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote , is uh um is a good idea , like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , you know , and uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm b
A :  But a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary .
C :  Yeah you you won't be using it , so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word and it's uh it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like uh it could indicate you're uh it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote , the blinking . At the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also or
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And you want okay for coming back to one point y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? Some of them ?
A :  Two thirty five supposed to finish .
C :  Yeah you can let them to do that .
D :  And uh isn't that too difficult for the we want w I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to be easy to use , that's the compromise .
A :  Hmm .
C :  N no but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . Like for example uh I would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint . So it de
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think you can do it both ways . You can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features .
D :  A standard .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um yes but but I do maybe you can give a hand to us because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents . I'm sorry to have
C :  So
D :  Yeah .
C :  So
A :  Hmm .
B :  Every time I have to come down on this price again to so this might be a little limiting for your creativity , but it's it's it's the real
A :  Hmm .
A :  Hmm .
B :  We have to consider it . S so do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition , I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm yeah like I would say that for programming uh keys , you said , uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros , but for the A_S_R_ system , uh I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this or
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  We well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can uh check how much how much they yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Exactly yeah i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented , and w how much it's cost , maybe with a f cheap chip .
A :  Mm .
C :  Maybe we can come we we can talk to them , and we can come with that , you know . And also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some kind of indicator , so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ it could actually be used to detect also . If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also .
B :  Mm mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
C :  So
B :  Mm .
A :  I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something .
C :  No actually i if i it is like you know it tells you um , it can be for two purposes , like if you have an L_C_D_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote , which is having uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of D_C_ .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  It may need more actually , so y you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . And then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something and it can change the colour depending on your uh how much is the battery , well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to .
D :  Mm .
D :  It's true .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  You know .
D :  .
B :  'Kay good .
C :  Yeah so
D :  I don't know how if if I have time to talk about the
B :  Mm yes um I would
C :  You you have time some more ? Yep .
B :  Yes yes you can you can still . We have time .
D :  Okay .
C :  Sure you can you know .
D :  So what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . So the method is ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like , and uh what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So there are two uh different types of uh um
B :  Nice .
D :  Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control . Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver . And uh yeah the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components um .
C :  Hmm .
D :  So you finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key , and uh uh that's , with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . And uh so I think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology , and this is important , and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them .
C :  Yeah mm mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So my personal design we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . If it's plastic or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit , veg or I dunno . Yes .
A :  Mm .
B :  Well well m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case . I mean just what
D :  Yes .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
A :  Mm just have a yeah
D :  Yeah like they do in with cars I think . Yeah inside the car yeah . So they also emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse . And uh very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays , so I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ .
A :  Just the veneer on it , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some uh compromise to to do . So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright . And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items , then I think w we could be able to handle that . So to to sum up um
A :  Hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  we need yeah so I I just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed and um and um assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account . And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert so that we can it's really a team-working uh . So I I cannot design something without your agreement , right ?
C :  Sorry .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah so of course for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there , or if you want to store a programmes with a keys
B :  No of course .
D :  Yes .
C :  What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside
C :  W wh what
D :  Yeah it's kind of um simple pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions of
C :  W what
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card .
D :  Exactly yeah , for customizing and yeah .
C :  Yeah where they do all the wi with with them actually . How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So
D :  Yeah good idea .
B :  So I f I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this . Um so I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip
D :  Yeah .
B :  we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features .
D :  Exactly yeah that's a very good idea , we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle , uh it's called F_P_G_A_ chip , that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh L_C_D_ and yeah .
B :  Yes .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip .
D :  Yes .
C :  D well
B :  Do you think that's feasible ?
C :  Well I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know .
B :  Uh
B :  You th you think it's possible .
C :  Is it possible to fit in to that ?
D :  Yeah also thinking , I think both uh if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros , it will be okay , but uh
C :  Sorry .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Well maybe we need specific costings then . Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better .
D :  .
D :  Yeah that's an excellent idea .
B :  Mm yes wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . That w that would be a very good idea .
D :  Yeah yeah . Yeah because right now I don't have price in in head but for next meeting I'm sure yeah be able to do that .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Good good .
C :  Yeah that's uh that's something which I wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . For example if f if you want to put wood I wouldn't suggest for wood uh 'cause it's I think it's m
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood . It will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing , but
D :  I agree on that . Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yes but I can I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which which come with a with another price .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah it's uh
C :  Yeah we we can give a preference to them , but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for
B :  Do do you agree ?
D :  Yeah but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood , and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with uh graphs or I don't know uh User Interface Designer you could maybe uh help us on that .
A :  Mm yeah sure .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Ma I I think uh for next meeting we c you two can present a real design .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
B :  Uh so drawing it on the board .
D :  Perfect yeah .
B :  And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh .
B :  So um
B :  Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs , one one
C :  Yeah sure .
C :  Yeah we will uh
B :  one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Uh .
B :  Uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case which can be later uh fancied up with uh
B :  with addit uh additional uh , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it . But that that that that can be done later . We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah customized .
C :  .
A :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
B :  Um .
C :  We can give them smooth keys , you know .
C :  Smooth keys
C :  with bigger s uh
C :  So that you know
C :  The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together to
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  So is there any of these that you're looking at particularly or is this just ideas ?
C :  Oh you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , and uh now you can , for example , as I was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . At the same time , it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all problem . Uh big keys may better for them actually and uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm yeah .
B :  Yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing I think .
A :  You see ?
D :  I agree yeah , and not too m too many keys of course yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  No no .
A :  Mm well one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm mm mm .
B :  Mm w but then you have still have uh when you don't use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control which you don't use . So maybe it's possible uh , I don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Um yeah I've seen that before too . Anoth another like b it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yeah so it's something like this , the model here s you can put the keys
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  But I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well .
D :  That's what you mean ?
B :  Yes I I th that's what I mean so I mean something
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  like like a book .
A :  I like this one . I like the shape of this one .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Can we have can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box that's a maybe curved or something .
D :  Yeah I like also this one .
D :  Yeah , the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or
C :  Yeah , mm .
A :  Mm mm 'kay . Is this for the next meeting though ? I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting .
C :  We should make a
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah that yeah next meeting we should be
D :  Okay .
B :  Ju just make two designs ,
C :  Yeah that would depend upon us actually .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah .
B :  and the we we can decide decide between th those designs .
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah okay .
B :  I think that would be a good idea . So anyone uh any questions for now ?
D :  Perfect .
C :  No no .
A :  No .
C :  I don't have .
A :  So is this is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ?
B :  Um yes I come to that uh uh
C :  Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um
C :  for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that .
B :  Yes well m maybe uh , I don't know whether that's possible , maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay well is this me designing a way to evaluate it so
A :  Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ?
B :  I don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time but a as far as possible .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yep .
B :  So uh you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes
D :  Exactly .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email .
D :  Two or three prototypes ? Two ?
C :  Two .
B :  Two .
C :  One for like cost and the one with like higher-end so that then we can be easily comparing them or you know find a compromise between both of them , yeah that's how it is .
B :  I
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm and then
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah and find maybe a compromise .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yes okay .
D :  Perfect yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay let's call this to an end .
C :  Yep .
C :  Okay .
A :  Mm 'kay . Thanks guys .
D :  Thanks .
C :  So we are done
C :  for now .
C :  .
A :  Did you get my email with the slides ?
A :  Ah . Tricky .
C :  I guess I have to change the pen otherwise . Will be completely different .
A :  Dunno . Maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats .
A :  Might be seat floor rather than person .
A :  Yeah , put it back .
C :  Yeah . And do you think it's .
A :  Yep .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Jo's making faces at me .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So .
B :  Matthew is uh late again .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Probably an important man . Um .
B :  So well it is important for him to be here uh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So what can you ?
B :  He he he
B :  You did work together didn't you ?
C :  Yeah we will yeah , so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting , but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer .
B :  Yes .
C :  I think we can put on the here .
B :  Yes . Yes .
C :  Uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items .
B :  Mm . Um yes but w we
C :  Um , can we have a phone , can someone
B :  Yes , maybe we should phone him .
C :  it's really w well designed .
B :  Um well
A :  Mm .
B :  Um , when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . Um so just for record I I will take uh notes again .
A :  Mm , object tracking .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  And um
B :  well first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . It's uh well he said to me well uh
C :  'Kay .
B :  when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . There is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter .
B :  So we have to consider that .
C :  Yep .
B :  Good .
B :  so maybe Anna , you can have your presentation .
A :  Well we can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design .
B :  Okay Matthew . Nice uh you are here .
C :  Great .
B :  Great . Great . Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs .
C :  Yep .
C :  So I will start by the the basic one that uh
C :  fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros , and uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it's like a surf board . And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff . And also it's not too far from um a mobile .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Or browse .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
C :  So people are used to that kind of shape , right . Don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah we don't take yeah . So here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led yeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_ ,
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now .
D :  I yeah .
B :  Eye .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  L_E_D_ .
C :  the on-off button , in red . Here would be the volume . On the on the left , okay , so easy to turn on t and off . And um so this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on uh Matthew .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  Uh-huh .
D :  Mm-hmm , hmm .
B :  Yes .
D :  Also so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_ , by the way ?
D :  Oh no no no , this is a single this this is a model with just the T_V_ one . No no just sorry , this is a standard T_V_ one , we are not talking about that . So and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel .
C :  Okay yeah . Yeah yeah .
B :  Ah , okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . Actually .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay so it's it's t a very basic remote then , it's only
D :  It's a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight Euros .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Seven , eight , ei eight Euros .
A :  Mm .
B :  Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So this one model and uh yeah . Sure .
A :  Can I see ?
A :  Thanks .
A :  Okay I like the volume control , that's good .
C : 
D :  Th this is a magic one but I know we don't want to talk about that , you know like uh i i i it is a very futuristic , it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . So that uh then what we look t yeah .
A :  Uh-huh .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So it doesn't actually have buttons .
A :  Did you wanna see ?
B :  Mm-hmm . Yeah no you can carry on , I just
D :  This is a model , yeah .
B :  look how it feels all . Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yep .
B :  Just I'm I really want to talk to it . But . So but but continue with your uh mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah actually , yeah .
A :  It won't talk back .
D :  Uh so well then the this is the a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys , but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here .
A :  Right .
B :  Mm .
D :  And so they have more space actually and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh uh infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo yeah s pause or stop , and uh then uh you can uh you have a L_C_D_ display , here and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say , y you press it
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Play , pause .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  From D_V_D_ player to television or something .
D :  Yeah . I really can change it , so
C :  Exactly yeah . To audio and to video on demand .
B :  Yes .
B :  Mm .
D :  Instead of having many switches , y
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ yeah .
D :  The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that , and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here , or in the button th here , so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . And here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one , which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier okay . And uh well then we have a cover basically , basically you don't need much of the time this , when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing
C :  Yes .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  This is the orange button , the microphone .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  An yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Crazy dis designer , okay .
D :  to this cover you know . Design enter .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah . It's basically to do that .
B :  But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh
C :  Yeah .
B :  well an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be
D :  Actually when you are watching the T_V_ , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , you know , uh you want to uh and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . Gives a protection because when it falls down or something
C :  Oh actually well .
B :  That th that's true .
B :  Mm .
D :  it it is it is is is it gives a protec it's more robust that way . Uh yeah . And you have very good chances
B :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yes . Yes , more robust .
B :  Yes okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  It's low weight . You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So the the cost is actually a bit more , it's uh it's it's sixteen Francs .
D :  It
D :  Sixteen Euros .
C :  Sixteen Euros sorry .
B :  Okay .
A :  So it's well outside the budget then .
C :  Then it's out of budget . But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item so three Euros sorry . And um
B :  But w
D :  Yeah .
D :  Three Euros .
A :  That's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ?
C :  No no no , part of that , yeah .
D :  Part of that .
A :  So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Mm 'kay . Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well I think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah it it should not be cluttering up everything .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  it's too
A :  What's this one on the side ?
D :  Ah that's for the it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery and as well as it's like a blinking one you know you can keep it aside .
C :  Locati . Location .
A :  Ah okay .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . I like the shape of them , I do like the
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  the size and the the shape .
B :  Well well
B :  Mm . Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two .
B :  Yes . Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at .
A :  Okay .
A :  Basically this is what we've talked about already , um , from the marketing point of view . We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account Yep .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well just
B :  do it quickly if if we al already .
A :  So it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . Um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , so
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  These are the things we identified as being important . Um the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ?
B :  Um , n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now ,
A :  Okay .
A :  So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . Not sure how this is gonna come out .
A :  So the first one was really very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ? 'Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a
B :  Mm , well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And then I mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half Euro and
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
B :  to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro .
C :  Functionality .
A :  Okay so look and feel , innovation
D :  And now it easy to use .
C :  Easy to use .
B :  Mm .
C :  target .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And trends .
A :  Oh , you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? Is that part of both of them or ?
B :  Um well w w we can still discuss that . So um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive , but
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I've received uh a framework which we can do this . I mean did you have this this Excel sheet ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  No .
D :  No .
B :  No okay , this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh .
A :  No .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  So maybe we can start with this , uh , calling this one .
A :  Okay . Yep . So it's the pink .
B :  Th th this is the first design .
A :  And the other one's green .
B :  Yes .
A :  Okay , so look and feel ?
A :  Where um one is I've broken the pen again .
B :  Uh there is another pen .
A :  S yeah . Get that one . Um w one's bad and seven's the best . Sorry , one's true and seven's false . One's the best .
B :  Okay .
A :  So on a scale of one to seven ?
B :  'Kay .
B :  Okay . So . Look and feel .
B :  Well you already feel that uh pretty much I think .
D : 
B :  In i in my opinion
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . But that's just half , we should also consider look , and then
A :  Mm-hmm , yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  i it looks
B :  quite conventional .
A :  Mm .
B :  Don't you agree ?
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at , so
B :  So maybe two . Hmm . Hmm . Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five
B :  I It's my opinion , but I don't know what what
D :  Well I will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say you know . It though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case you know .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Four maybe .
A :  Four ? Okay .
D :  Four yeah that
B :  Four , four . Now we th th then we settle on four .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I will gi yeah .
C :  Uh .
B :  'Kay . Can you maybe fix the other
C :  Yeah . If you press like this not like this then you
A :  Mm .
A :  No that's the ink's dried .
D :  No . C can you get the batteries ? No no the battery has fallen down , that's i
A :  Battery's low , isn't it the ink ? The b that's the that that one ? battery there .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But
D :  No no it's not that , it's how to close a battery .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay ? Now it should be .
A :  Mm .
A :  No I think it's lost a battery .
B :  Mm , try it , just try it . Oh it will not ri mm , mm .
A :  No it's It would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors .
D :  Is there another battery there ? Oh yeah .
A :  You got a second ?
C :  Try a
A :  Well we won't be able to tell .
B :  Yes , it it has a mm .
C :  Perfect .
A :  Is that working ?
A :  Did it come out ? Good . Okay . Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just a normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard .
B :  Good . Good .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yep .
B :  Okay . So then then
A :  And the other one ?
C :  Wow .
B :  Ah .
A :  I think it's slightly better , um ,
B :  Mm .
A :  it's hard to tell from just the plasticine , but
B :  I I
B :  I
B :  When we want to include I I I'm doubting about this this component .
B :  It it it it breaks in your
A :  Mm .
C :  'Kay maybe
D :  No actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , it it's n i it is jus
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
C :  It's not a button it's a led , it's a
D :  It's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve
C :  Ac actually yeah it should be embedded .
B :  Mm , yes I see , mm okay .
D :  It's will be embedded there so it won't be really you know protruding or something .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Oh you can push push it again , you can push it .
A :  Yeah . The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? 'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , maybe it won't work so well .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . No you it it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that
A :  Okay .
B :  Well r r
A :  I'd say two or three for that one , personally .
B :  Mm .
A :  Probably more towards three than two .
B :  I think the look is better but the feel is is is worse . So so I would also say this is four . But w w do you what do you think ?
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh it's fine I think . My just that um the feel is that um
D :  you right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Mm . Yes .
D :  This is how embedded one will
B :  Yes , it basically is the same shape .
D :  Yeah . It's a bas basically the same thing actually . You will be Except that in this c
B :  Mm-hmm . Mm .
C :  And the L_C_D_ makes it better . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . And you might have a slight thing for to forward and
B :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Mm , okay .
C :  So I will say two .
A :  Yeah it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yes , okay .
C :  I would say two , three .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So , consensus ? Two or three ? Two ?
B :  Two ? Mm . Two's good yes .
C :  Yep .
D :  looking like
A :  Um , 'kay . Innovation . The first one , not really muc
C :  Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , right ?
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . Do we
D :  No but except for the design of the surf . You should be rea
C :  Yeah . The surf uh design .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  What What features are we actually including ? Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ?
A :  There's nothing like that ?
D :  Uh no I think it's more of the feel .
A :  But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all , it's just a straight-out remote control .
D :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . The only innova innovation is the shape .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Say about that .
A :  Okay . So there's no this uh look and feel thing , though that's not a technological innovation . So I'd be up for seven for innovation .
B :  S so that
C :  Yeah . You're right .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And the
C :  And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . And um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part .
D :  Yep .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , it gives it
B :  Yes . A and the L_C_D_ screen is
C :  Yeah .
B :  That's that's that's well it's quite innovative .
C :  And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this .
B :  Mm .
C :  Uh could put it at one or two I would say .
B :  Yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm .
A :  Okay .
C :  Personally .
D :  Yep .
A :  So what is it , what are the innovations with this ? Got the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Uh
C :  Yeah automatic speech recognition .
A :  Is that in this one though ? Is this 'cause this is the
A :  Th th there were different options we discussed then , we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget .
D :  No , we ha
B :  We just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget .
A :  Okay . So the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one ? Eight Euros ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  So
B :  Eight .
C :  Eight .
C :  Well actually we have yeah to check again yeah .
D :  Yeah , eight Euros yeah .
A :  And this one was sixteen Euros .
B :  Yes .
C :  Sixteen .
D :  Sixteen Euros .
A :  Okay . So .
A :  Innovation for this one is two ? One ?
D :  It's a two , I would say two .
B :  Two .
A :  Two ?
C :  W W un to be one what would do we nee actually , yeah , I don't see okay , one would would be without buttons , .
B :  Why it is one .
B :  A man w w
A :  Mm . Well the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it , so
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah . So maybe we can put one .
B :  This this is it w with the speech recognition ?
C :  It's using speech recognition , yeah .
D :  Okay yeah .
B :  Well . Gi given that that it works , then it's I think one .
C :  Yeah , one , yeah .
A :  Give it a one ? Yep .
A :  Okay . Ease of use ?
D :  Uh
C :  So the first one is really standard , so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , right ?
A :  Mm .
D :  He is used to it act
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  They are used to it actually .
A :  Yep . So that's maybe a a two for ease of use .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Here there may
C :  Um , the other one is quite easy , tho though .
D :  Uh , though it has more functionality I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . It shouldn't be diffi
A :  Okay .
B :  Hmm .
A :  So maybe a three or a four .
D :  Uh yeah , actually in fact I think it will be Yeah
C :  One me um we hope maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah but y
C :  And there is a like I would say three . Or maybe four .
A :  Okay .
D :  Well we have reduced the keys actually you see . Three is fine with me .
A :  Consensus ? Three or four ?
B :  Three , I would . Three .
C :  Yeah , yeah because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so ,
A :  Three ? Okay .
D :  Yeah it's a actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually , it's not so easy , like this one the normal .
B :  No .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yes but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy .
D :  Is quite easy yeah . Initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah .
B :  So so I think th three is good . Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Good . What's the next ?
A :  So three's uh how well it goes to the target demographic .
A :  So we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? That's
D :  Mm .
B :  So
B :  Twe twenty to forty , yes that's
C :  This one would be uh for grandmothers .
A :  Mm .
D :  Oh no , this would I I would I would give this model to the old people actually . Yeah .
C :  No .
C :  Yeah , grandmothers , yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So sh completely changed our demographic there , it's not part of the the funky young thing .
D :  And
B :  Well exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think , but
C :  Yeah that's true .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being applying to the the demographic yeah . That's it's still Ye
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic
A :  Mm . 'Cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it , that's right .
B :  Mm .
B :  But as it is now , I w would say
B :  mm , six , something .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh yeah , .
B :  Do you agree ?
A :  And
D :  I Well I think
C :  Yeah because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets , the right range of people , right ?
D :  Yeah . Uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . But w
D :  So
A :  But it's going to be cheap whatever though , it was set with i we've got a set price .
D :  And people can still decide to use the cheaper one
C :  Yeah .
D :  instead of a
C :  But for us it's yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros .
B :  Mm , yeah , indeed . Th t t
A :  Yeah . There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Ju just think , twenty five Euros , I mean it's not going to be cheaper .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay . So in that case well it's fine then . We can yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Mm . Okay .
A :  Okay . Um and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ?
D :  And the demographics of
A :  It's got the got the the toys in it , it's got the L_C_D_ screen and
B :  Yeah tha tha tha tha tha that's I think it's better , because of the L_C_D_ screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  on the and on the
C :  Yeah . And if you want to target yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm . So , the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts , yes . Because it
A :  Yeah . I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm , ma maybe that's something to consider , yes , so .
A :  Mm . Okay .
B :  Wh what what
A :  I'd probably go with three again for that one .
D :  Yeah I think it's uh it has more market actually .
C :  Or even
C :  Even one and two .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Y yeah , you know two .
B :  No s say t two . Two ?
C :  Or two .
A :  Okay . So , two , yeah ?
C :  Yeah . Two yeah .
D :  Yeah two yeah . Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that . Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include for the people to
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yep . And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , and that makes it more appealing , it's more of a a new fun toy .
D :  We have to practically test it . The field test will tell you how good .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay , the final point , trends .
A :  And following the trends . So the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel .
D :  The trends .
B :  Mm . Mm .
A :  So as it is , not really doing either of them .
B :  I think
C :  Spongy ,
C :  uh , that means that it goes in in the water .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well , the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , I know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons it's got just a one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy .
C :  Uh okay .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah I know .
C :  But this one includes this feature , right ? Spongy buttons .
D :  Yeah . We we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually .
A :  So it's sort of , yeah .
A :  Mm . Okay .
C :  So
B :  Mm .
C :  Uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie .
A :  But that's if you're using the covers . Or is it just one
B :  And the then we can al yes . We can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover
C :  Yeah .
B :  for s such a phone ? I mean
A :  Well they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated .
D :  But why do you want to cover that actually ? In that uh w in the mod
B :  Well just with the with the flexible plastic uh
A :  So you got the option of having different colours or different textures .
C :  Yeah . This is possible .
D :  Uh uh y are you sure ?
B :  I th I th I think
D :  Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah .
B :  O o or just two things which can be put on each other .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah exactly like Nokia phones .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yes , exactly like it . Uh , so
D :  Yep .
B :  Maybe we can but we have to decide it , we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm mm mm mm mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  'Cause sometimes look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , and uh it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
B :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm . Mm .
A :  And then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers .
B :  Yes . So so so that that would make the trends equal , so we we we really have don't have ,
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . There's n yeah . 'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them . Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um
B :  I mean
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , so a a point better for the for the number two .
B :  Yes , indeed .
A :  on the other one .
A :  Okay . So . Two and three , or one and two ?
B :  Yes .
D :  Yeah , it's one .
B :  Say , say one and two . One and two .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
B :  So le le let's see . So d this one has spongy but buttons ?
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , it says a
C :  Yeah , the blue one uh spongy .
B :  Mm , I see , yes okay . Good .
A :  Okay so the average of that is
A :  three six nine divided by five , so five
B :  Just add it . You know . Three , six , seven .
C :  Nine .
D :  One point six , one point
A :  nine by five , one point s eight ?
D :  One point eight yeah .
A :  This one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two yep .
D :  Four point
D :  Uh four point two .
C :  Very good .
A :  Okay . But we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We we must try to get them closer .
C :  Yeah , it's right , yeah that's right .
A :  Yep .
B :  Both in i i or we just have to choose . And adapt . Because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap .
D :  Wow .
A :  Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . That'll basically take us down to the budget .
B :  Yes , well
B :  But I'm now did y did you work with the same prices that I have here ?
C :  So I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh I explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros . Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip , uh Matthew , so maybe we have to recap with this one .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah . Yep .
B :  Mm , tha
D :  Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah .
B :  Well yes , well uh re reconsider it . So let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , uh what kind of energy source uh I I we didn't speak about that . It's a it's a normal battery , or
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , it migh It it'll need uh more than a conventional one , it won't be uh just maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually .
D :  What do you say , Mael ?
C :  For this one it's a normal battery .
B :  Yes . Just so one battery . 'Kay .
B :  Electronics . given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh sample speaker , yeah .
B :  Yeah , yes , or sample sensor , yes .
C :  Sample , yeah , this one .
B :  Yes , this one . Okay . Case ?
B :  Um ,
C :  So
D :  Curved . Double curved yeah right . It's uh
B :  I see I
B :  Double curve .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely .
B :  Mm .
C :  So which one are we talking to ?
D :  Are you talking about this or that ?
C :  Well
A :  Either of them .
B :  Oh yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , but , actually bu
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm . They're both going to be not basic cases .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So th th this would be double curves ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  'Kay .
B :  Uh , plastic would be the material .
A :  Yeah . The basic one , yep .
C :  Is it zero Franc ?
D :  A special colour ?
B :  Uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers .
D :  Uh
A :  So now we're either going button or L_C_D_s , L_C_D_ display .
B :  Push .
B :  Mm , yes , but
C :  L_C_D_ is . It's okay . Just say L_C_D_ .
A :  Is that price per unit , or for the whole
B :  Yeah th now this is per per unit , this number of components .
D :  Ah good .
A :  thing ?
A :  So it would need twelve buttons .
D :  Yeah , we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ?
C :  No but for this one it's twelve Euro .
D :  No , for that one also .
C :  There are twelve ?
B :  So , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , t
D :  Yeah that's a scroll .
B :  Yes . Twelve I believe .
B :  So this comes to eighteen .
A :  Mm . And that's without any special button supplements .
D :  Yeah , one scroll wheel you might need .
B :  So
A :  So we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . They're not just standard buttons .
D :  Uh
B :  So I think but th do you agree th that thi
C :  Wait a minute , it's not it's not double curved , it's single curved , right ? Because it's there is no like .
B :  Yes I
A :  But I thought it would be curved on two it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what I thought .
B :  Yes I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh
B :  sure .
C :  Well it's you know this curve like this so , it's w there is only
B :  Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean , yes .
C :  is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are yeah concave . So I think we can put um
A :  You talking about concave curves ?
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Both .
A :  You think a single curved ?
C :  the single curved in the sixteen .
C :  That makes uh seventeen . And what are just The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? Yeah .
B :  Yes .
A :  Mm .
B :  Uh
A :  We have more , we've got those the scroll wheel on the side and yeah
C :  So I had a bad uh
D :  Bad estimate , right ?
B :  W d we have we haven't talk about a , but that's no a is very exp inexpensive I believe but it is not in the list .
A :  The sc
C :  bad estimation .
A :  Mm .
A :  We've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we , or is it some other thing that's not on there .
B :  W ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ?
C :  No no no .
A :  'Kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast .
C :  Yes , a kind of scroll wheel .
A :  So this is even more than the um
B :  Mm . Mm-hmm .
A :  than the cost you gave , the sixteen Euros .
C :  Okay , so based on that , yeah , um where is the es okay sample speaker
D :  That is the sample sensor and sample speaker .
B :  So um
C :  But still , yeah it
D :  We just need that actually .
B :  We're
D :  We need one .
B :  We
B :  We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we can't have the the speech recognition , yes ? Yes ?
C :  No we cannot , yeah . So
B :  So so w when we w a this would this would be cutting the speech recognition .
C :  But the um
C :  Yeah but if you have the near the L_C_D_ you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip .
C :  Right , Matthew ?
D :  Oh I i it
C :  Or regular chip ?
D :  I think it's going to be y y yeah it's th with the regular chip , yeah .
C :  I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip .
B :  Say say it's regular , regular chip , and we still on fifteen , so
C :  Yeah . Okay . Okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So . And what about the number of buttons buttons uh
B :  Yes but that maybe
C :  my Matthew ?
B :  Well we can just say
D :  Uh
B :  one .
C :  When you look at this w , this u uh item ,
D :  Yeah .
B :  Ca l we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty .
C :  But
B :  So is it possible ?
A :  But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material .
D :  That'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really
B :  No no , he he he I I
C :  really low , no ?
A :  Well
A :  So the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And uh we don't want to to change that right ? We we really want a L_C_D_ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market .
D :  Uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this .
C :  It's evident .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  So twelve Euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , we can't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display , that's seven fifty
C :  And I dunno
A :  um , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons .
B :  Mm .
A :  And the chip . Sorry the chip's up there already .
B :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
A :  So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there's no doubt about that .
B :  A
C :  So wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , um
C :  Do you think it's important ?
D :  Or we could even replace them by buttons actually .
C :  Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? I dunno , I'm just asking .
D :  A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least .
B :  Mm
A :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display .
D :  Okay so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons .
C :  Yeah , it's true yeah .
C :  But uh , do we want that ?
C :  On the market point of view , yeah . What do you think uh , L_C_D_ is a major feature , or ?
B :  Mm . I
A :  For the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there .
B :  I think we have to come to a decision now , just I I think we we what we just do i is vote
A :  Mm .
B :  about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display so
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  You assume , you want a democratic voyt vote , right ? Okay .
B :  Yes . Yes . Yes . One man one vote . S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ?
C :  Okay .
A :  I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . I can't see it fitting in .
B :  Mm . Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
D :  I think but
C :  We need to be .
A :  Bu y you're a power voter uh veto anyway as Project Manager .
B :  Mm-hmm , I know , but
C :  Yeah . .
D :  Yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that .
A :  well we have to make a decision now , that's it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yes . So uh uh having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . Is that acceptable ? Ca can I have can the functions be implement in an
C :  Yes .
B :  You've you you agree .
D :  W I I I just
B :  So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons .
C :  Because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . Here one , at the middle , and at the
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm . I think then we we're really losing ease of use .
C :  bottom .
C :  Okay , .
D :  That will create another problem . For the people to use it .
D :  It's not going to be easy .
B :  Mm . So um I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's that's my opinion .
A :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
D :  Doing that .
D :  No , it's okay , you uh cut the L_C_D_ screen and introduce two more buttons .
B :  Just
A :  Okay . So L_C_D_'s out , is speech rec out now ? We've
C :  The speech recognition is out .
A :  Yep .
B :  Uh where , L_C_
C :  Because of the budget , yeah .
A :  Yep .
B :  Okay w we now we can just uh
A :  So are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much .
D :  Yeah .
A :  With these new costings . So just look at forget that one and look at that one now .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yes . Yes . I th I th I think w we just go for this one and that that now twelve Euros is the
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
B :  is is the price , okay . My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected .
A :  Okay . Well that's that's
A :  Yep .
C :  Actually yeah , we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount , yeah .
A :  So .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yep . So w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay , good . Then we the same . Thank you . That was it .
D :  Okay . That's it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Thanks .
D :  Cool .
A :  Okay .
