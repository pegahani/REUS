C :  Okay .
D :  Or you get it . Okay .
C :  No I don't think so it has to be like that yeah and you have to adjust the length .
C :  Okay , and then .
B :  So we uh we will wait for Anna , a few minutes .
C :  Yeah , s yeah , um .
D :  Mm . Yours is well
C :  I think you can put anywhere you want , actually .
D :  Yeah but the the mic should not
C :  I thin
C :  It's not a directional mic , anyway .
B :  I think it should work like this . So I will try to get my presentation running .
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm . Can't help you with that .
C :  Last .
D :  Okay , it's y yeah .
B :  It's no matter .
B :  No problem .
B :  Ah yes .
D :  Right .
C :  Okay .
D :  Then press uh al
C :  Okay .
D :  This . You know ?
B :  I don't know . Just try .
C :  'Kay .
B :  On this normal
D :  Oh oh .
C :  Alt F_ five .
B :  Good . Doesn't appear on the screen here .
D :  Right well
B :  Oh .
D :  Wow . Amazing . It's working .
B :  Okay . Thank you . Uh .
A :  Hold that .
B :  Yes and you can put can clip it uh on your
A :  Okay .
B :  Somewhere .
A :  Okay . Mm .
B :  So , good morning , everyone .
B :  Um
B :  Welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project . I hope you all have been uh updated about it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Good .
C :  So . Yes .
B :  So w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here . Um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . See what our roles are in this project .
B :  So , um
B :  We have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh
B :  to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans uh as I can say um so w
B :  we will also try to uh
B :  to get acquainted to this tools so they are also new to me I don't know whether you worked with them before . Um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . You all know I hope how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Total .
B :  Uh then we will uh discuss uh , well , how it should be and uh
B :  wh what uh what our new product should look lite like . And uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes I hope uh we can end this meeting .
B :  So . Um basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . Um
B :  We When you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original . Be uh we want to be distinguished , mm ? People uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product I I need . So it needs to be trendy . I mean trendy is what people want , so then I w they will buy our product .
B :  But then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh
B :  be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that .
B :  So , the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . Um
B :  You all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase and uh
B :  then we will meet again and uh discuss this functional design . And the same holds for the uh
B :  ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design
B :  and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape .
B :  Alright , but first we will do some uh tool training .
B :  In all in front of you uh you see uh the uh
B :  notebooks and w uh n note blocks and we have here a
B :  a a a white-board .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And um well it should work uh I've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . I didn't find out yet how it work , but maybe one of you did , so
B :  Um
D :  Under documents in the shared folder . Okay .
B :  Yes . Do Do we have to say something about that ? I I I'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh .
D :  Yeah , I guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . And uh , yeah .
B :  Yes well we will then find out ho how it works .
D :  Yes .
B :  Um .
B :  Well , this seems to me , yes , some computer program but I didn't find it yet .
B :  So , we'll come to that later .
B :  So , uh now we will try out the white-board we have here .
B :  So ,
B :  I would suggest uh
D :  Each of us is going .
B :  Well , yes , um we uh we should try to t to draw on it and then well it should be smart some way . I I'm not really sure how this works , but
D :  Okay , shall I start ?
A :  Mm . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , you can start it you know .
B :  Yes , a good idea Mael .
A :  I think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , but they'll be recording what we write down .
D :  So , i
C :  No they will record through that . There's a sensor over there which is going to record the strokes that you make .
A :  Mm . Mm .
A :  But for us it's just like a normal whiteboard .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  'Kay .
D :  But it's
D :  Actually , I think I cannot go with uh
B :  You you
B :  D doesn't it work ?
B :  Maybe someo Maybe maybe Anna , maybe you can start . Then he can maybe find out to get his cord right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I have to draw .
B :  So um
B :  L Why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board .
A :  M my my favourite animal . Sorry this is all tangled up here .
B :  Oh , I see uh
A :  That's better .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yes . Mm .
B :  So draw it . We will try to guess what it is .
A :  Mm-hmm . I'm a very bad drawer .
A :  Weird .
A :  Um . You're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing . I'm a bad drawer . Okay .
B :  Mm .
A :  They're ears , by the way . No . Um close though .
C :  's a cat .
A :  Okay so like a pet animal .
D :  Okay .
A :  Like a cat .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It's like a cat , so I guess it's a cat .
A :  No , not a cat though .
B :  What is this now ?
C :  Ah you forget about it .
D :  You're on the knife .
C :  Yeah , uh I think it's fine . I just don't want to carry it off .
C :  Man , this wires , eh ? We need a wireless microphone .
C :  You know ? Pro specially we should next project we should take l like that .
B :  So , that's the cat . Oh .
A :  Okay . So . It's not a cat , it's a dog . Yes .
D :  Mael .
C :  So .
B :  It's a dog .
B :  So but that's also kind of cat , isn't it ?
C :  Oh the dog doesn't have a tail ?
A :  It's got a tail then .
B :  B bo both predators .
C :  Yeah , sure , yeah . I thought so . The dogs have a tail .
A :  Yeah yeah .
A :  So do cats . And you guessed cats without a tail .
B :  So , thank you . Uh d did you uh work out cord ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think I will go without without it , right ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  It'll still not extend , right ? It's not up to that .
A :  Okay , there you go . So what favourite characteristics . Uh . Dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun .
A :  A horse ?
C :  It's a horse .
A :  This is why you're the designer . And I'm marketing .
B :  Yes . Yes , yes this is Yes definitely a horse . Yes . Oh very good . So
A :  Ah
B :  I suppose it
C :  Ah I think you can put that .
A :  Mm-hmm . That's it .
A :  A blue and black zebra .
B :  Yes .
B :  Can you can meet them in Africa , I think . Yes . Very good . So
A :  The very rare blue zebras . Yes .
C :  I'll tell to get it off my
B :  Ma Matthew ?
C :  Uh ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So
A :  You got a lot of room here . You can probably reach .
B :  Maybe
C :  Oh y it's not for that .
A :  No ?
C :  No .
B :  I hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh Mael .
C :  Okay . Yeah .
C :  So what should I draw ? Mm .
C :  He has already to do cat .
A :  I took a dog .
A :  Um .
A :  A mouse ?
B :  This looks likes a cat who has been driven over .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . And we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , right ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , the moustache .
D :  So
B :  That's that's definitely a cat .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh yeah . And i Th They like to sleep , that's why you said you they are like this .
B :  It's quite , you know relaxed situation . Yes .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , okay .
D :  She has the small legs .
B :  Th thank you , Matthew .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Thank you , Matthew . Perfect .
A :  It's a very big rat . Or a very small cat .
D :  Oh a rat , okay .
B :  Yes , this is certain uh
B :  some contribution to our project . So . Let's see . Which animal has not been drawn yet .
D :  And you ,
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Your turn .
B :  So you've all drawn land animals , so why not draw an animal from the water .
D :  A bird . Okay , in the water .
A :  Ah I don't know what that is . It's a bit
D :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  It's a bit hard to guess .
D :  Yeah . Put it colours . Maybe it would help us .
C :  So
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  The cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ?
D :  With different pen widths .
A :  Mm-hmm
B :  So
A :  Oh , it's a shark now .
D :  Ah it's a shark , yeah .
B :  Oh , yes , why not ? Good idea .
C :  Ah it's a baby shark , it looks to me , you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ?
A :  Mm .
D :  Oh .
A :  Now it's a swordfish .
B :  Why not . A swordfish .
D :  You have some in in Australia , right ? Yeah . I dunno .
A :  Swordfish . Um , maybe .
A :  I've never seen one , no .
D :  Oh well .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I hope it still works . So
D :  Perfect . So I dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually But uh
C :  You should go for the next one it seems to me .
B :  W Well , this uh this tool seemed to work . Let's continue to uh to the real stuff .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , exactly , yeah .
D :  Wow .
B :  Um our project uh finance uh
B :  thing . Uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five Euros , so when
C :  Twenty four .
B :  designing a project uh I also look at you uh Mael , keep in mind uh uh uh People uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  want to get the feeling this is a twenty five Euro project uh pr um
D :  Per remote control , yeah ? Per project .
B :  product .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yes . Okay . Um more interesting for our company of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million Euro . So we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things . Uh we will try to uh
B :  to get at a international market uh so um it will be I think mainly Europe and uh Northern America ,
C :  Ah yeah , the sale man , four million .
B :  maybe some uh Asian countries .
B :  Um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve Euro and fifty cents .
D :  So it's half of the selling price , if I am good in mathematics .
B :  Yes , of course . Uh um I mean we still have to uh to make a profit , huh ?
C :  They have to sell at least four million to make a profit
D :  Of course .
A :  Mm .
B :  You all have to be paid .
A :  Mm .
B :  Excuse me ?
C :  Ah we have to make we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . Fifty mill
D :  Oh you're g very good in mathematics . Four million .
A :  Yes .
B :  Yes , indeed .
B :  So uh well I think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers uh so when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , I think .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So , that about finance .
B :  And uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , it has to be trendy , it has to be user friendly .
B :  Um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Of course it should have a on off button .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , well i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , s and it depends what application you are using it for . You might need uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  We wer we were thinking television . Uh .
A :  Mm .
C :  We are targ targeting the television set . So , you need to record the channels . You need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way ,
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , yes . Th th that's very handy I I always miss it and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels .
A :  Mm .
C :  Uh
C :  And
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Uh , and
D :  And uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we You are the marketing guy ? Or th So you are the marketing . And you are in the u use user interface uh design . So just yeah I wanted to to be sure . And I I'm the the industrial designer okay . Because I I don't know you very well , actually , but yeah . Okay . Mael . Happy to meet you . Okay . It's very uh
A :  I'm marketing .
C :  Marketing .
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Sure .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
C :  Oh .
C :  I'm Matthew . You know . Matth s uh Anna . And um uh Matthew , yeah . I thi think you know me , yeah ? right yeah .
A :  Anna .
B :  A and I'm Nanne .
B :  So
D :  Uh so yeah uh Just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face .
B :  Yes .
B :  So . Um
D :  So mm
C :  So .
B :  S s
A :  Mm .
B :  Are there some other very important things to to do well ,
D :  So I
C :  So
B :  to specify in this first phase of of the project . So the browse function , as you m mentioned .
A :  Mm . Yeah . Oth yeah .
C :  And uh ,
C :  you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel and then you uh Today we have uh um teletext and all those things . Tomorrow you might have a some more functions which might come through that , so
B :  Yes . Yeah .
B :  Yes .
A :  Mm .
D :  Like what ? Like internet on the on T_V_ ?
C :  Yeah I_P_O_ or . Now we are looking for
A :  Mm .
C :  television things or I_P_ . For example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  But we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Ah it's it's it's it's coming up , actually . The personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up .
B :  Mm , well uh I I think
D :  Actually , yeah w
B :  Uh w y you two should should , I think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality .
C :  Let's Let's take
D :  Of course , and first before um designing the func well thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . Um then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh T_V_ over I_P_ . But before
A :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But
A :  Ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , so we can have all the fancy things as well but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use .
B :  Mm mm mm . Keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five Euro unit , so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh
B :  w we can leave that out , I think . So twenty five Euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Oh in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that and you know , you you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know .
A :  Mm .
A :  So try and get T_V_ manufacturers to
D :  Yeah , but w w we want to design a new one . Mm .
C :  Yeah . No , it's okay , yeah I understand . So we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things and then um
D :  Yeah .
D :  The Yeah , the main is browsing . Yeah .
B :  Yes , but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . I I think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Uh I would like to get this wrapped up and go to an end of this meeting .
C :  Okay .
B :  So
C :  Okay , we are alread mm . Mm .
D :  Okay .
B :  So you know now the basic the basic things . And
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  well just just for the next meeting , um
B :  well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , keep it general , I mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . So
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  you will be working on on
B :  technical function design , so
C :  Yeah , sure .
B :  And uh you and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , eh ? Does it need internet , or or do do we stay at
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  basic basic television uh interface .
C :  Stam .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So , uh
B :  I think we should now all go work uh uh at this and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  Perfect .
B :  So next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh . K keep it in mind .
B :  How do you wear this thing ?
A :  Hmm . Mm mm mm .
B :  Not too many cables and stuff .
B :  Original .
A :  Is recorded ? Okay ? Okay so welcome everyone . So we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control .
A :  So I will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff , then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it .
A :  And uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process .
A :  So
B :  Uh . Just one thing . Uh , you said twenty-five minutes , but I have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon , so maybe you could hurry up a bit
A :  sorry ?
B :  It's true . I have another meeting so if you could uh
A :  You have another meeting soon ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  So you have to be quick .
B :  Yeah , for the lawnmower project .
A :  Okay . So the the goal is to have a remote control so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly .
B :  Okay .
A :  So uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . First it will be the functional design .
A :  Third is the conceptual design and then is the desired design . So the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil .
A :  And then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that .
A :  And then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point .
A :  So I will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board .
B :  What an original idea .
A :  Do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ?
B :  Orangutan .
A :  Okay that's good . n n
C :  No no n
B :  Can I give you the no ? But I don't have to say anything .
A :  You should
B :  When I'm drawing the orangutan .
A :  If you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh I'll let you uh comment .
B :  It's an abstract drawing of an orangutan .
A :  Okay it's an abstract drawing .
B :  Yes .
A :  I think it's nice and original .
C :  You should write y the name I think .
B :  I don't have a red colour . Usually orangutans have red hair so this is a very important but I don't have red pen , so
A :  Okay .
B :  Yes .
A :  You want to draw something Christine ?
D : 
D :  Okay uh sorry . You have to imagine a little bit um .
D :  This
A :  Of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost .
D :  Sorry too uh .
B :  Yes . I know .
B :  Wha what is this strange beast ?
A :  Is this uh
D :  Is it beautiful ?
B :  Is it a monster ?
D :  Do you know ? It's a cat . Isn't it ?
B :  It's a cat ?
B :  I thought these things did not exist .
D :  Yes yes is it like that . Is it better ? Okay . It's my cat . Yeah . The name is Caramel .
C :  Me Ah yeah . Yeah .
B :  Ah yeah
A :  Ah okay it's pretty .
A :  Okay it's your cat .
B :  Does have a name ?
B :  Caramel . Ah-ha .
C :  Caramel . And you I think I'm too short for the cables .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Olivier , do you want to
A :  Okay I go , but next time you'll do something I'm sure .
B :  Next time I concentrate .
A :  I'm a bit short on cable . Okay . So what could I draw ? Maybe I can draw like
A :  a very simplified cow . I don't know if it looks like a cow
B :  He looks like a bong .
A :  Like a what ?
B :  Okay . Sorry . No .
C :  Quite squarey .
B :  Scary ?
A :  I dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact I would say . Okay so I hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control .
C :  He also .
B :  I I think we will be finished this uh
C :  Mm .
B :  Is it for uh for putting a for logos , no .
A :  Okay .
B :  That's
A :  Let's move on . So
A :  Here the uh financial objective of our project . That is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five Euros and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million Euros .
B :  I is there a matter for a new remote control ?
A :  Yeah if it's trendy , original I d fulfil the user needs .
B :  Is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ?
A :  We have to discuss that point . On yeah you you can suggest points like this . So what what so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple .
B :  Ah this is not defined at all ?
B :  Ah , okay .
A :  So what's what are your ideas about that ? Maybe I can have the your opinion from the marketing side ?
B :  Well uh do we sell other stuff ?
B :  Uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one otherwise who would buy a remote control from us .
A :  Okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Do you agree ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . So maybe it should be for multiple devices .
A :  And uh do you have any ideas um of uh design ideas or any uh uh technical requirement we we should uh fulfil ?
C :  I think we shouldn't have too many b for my part . I think
B :  No , I couldn I cannot fi think of any requirements right now .
C :  If we don't have so many buttons could be nice .
A :  Few buttons . Okay . And do you have it also to be to be lighted in order to be used in the dark ? Might be a good idea .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . And do you have any um any uh idea of the trend the trend in domain , what it shouldn't it should look like , or things like that ?
C :  Something which is not squarey maybe uh , not a box .
B :  Mm .
A :  With rou okay . Like for okay .
B :  Something like that , least fits in your hand .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . The basic requirement .
A :  Okay .
A :  So . Fit in your hand , yeah .
B :  Only a buck .
A :  And also it have , i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh
A :  To , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall . Water-proof as well . Maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others can't .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Waterproof .
C :  And I think we should have a device
A :  Maybe water-proof would be very original .
C :  Sorry .
A :  Havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath .
B :  Mm .
B :  B it seems uh so , but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f
A :  That could be uh
A :  Yeah but , it is still something uh you have to buy and that is um not maybe very
B :  And , and that's one of the that's one of the shock I mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . That's people they actually do it themselves .
A :  Yeah , mayb
A :  But maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well .
C :  Yeah .
C :  directly .
B :  I it will look a bulky in that case .
A :  Yeah . Maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection
C :  Yeah .
A :  and uh and a waterproof box as well .
A :  That might be good uh track to follow .
B :  Like as an optional thing .
A :  Optional or selled with it ?
C :  And I I think we should have something , most of the time I I lose my remote control . We should have s uh special bu button on the T_V_ to make the remote control beeping .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe we can have uh
A :  But we don't design the T_V_ . Maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep .
C :  Ah yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Barks .
C :  Barks .
A :  Yeah , barks , yeah . So we can uh have a whistle uh remote control ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah whistle .
A :  I don't know , whistle-able ?
C :  Whistle tracking .
A :  Whistle tracking yeah . Whistle tracking remote control . That's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve .
B :  That's that's quite cool , but uh of course we you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ?
A :  Yeah d d uh .
B :  So i it's just going to add t to the cost .
A :  Yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors . I think this is a good advantage .
B :  It's cool . I think I like the idea , but I'm not sure about the what you , who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget . Who's
A :  Yeah . We have to ask
A :  Yeah . We have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh Industrial um Designer .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . yeah
A :  Which is you . Okay so try to find that for next meeting .
B :  'Kay .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay . So next meeting is in thirty minutes or so uh . Don't pani . So so I will ask the Industrial Designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed .
C :  Don't panic .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So then I will ask the User Interf Interface Designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And also um I will ask the Market Expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user .
A :  So . And then uh I will uh just ask you to think about that and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon .
B :  Mm .
A :  So .
A :  Thank you I think that's all for this point .
B :  Good .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Thank you
B :  Uh , so we come back in five minutes ?
B :  Half an hour .
A :  Anyway you will receive some messages .
A :  Be careful .
A :  You eat it ?
A :  Does it move uh ?
A :  Okay , but I don't know if it uh is still correctly uh
A :  We'll see .
C :  Ah .
A :  we are here to talk about functional design . Now hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now .
A :  So here's an agenda . Uh I'll open . Um you should know that I'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , as I was struggling to our last time uh and that'll be easier for me now because I'm not actually giving the whole presentation . Uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that I forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful .
A :  Um now you can all give your presentations . We can talk about the requirements and hopefully come to some decisions . Right , forty minutes for this meeting , so a bit more time than the last one .
A :  Here's the additional points I just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments
A :  on them .
A :  Uh did you all receive that email ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
A :  So does anyone have any overall
D :  Well uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
D :  So that's , from a marketing perspective I I see I see a lack . And so we have to go , I think , in the other direction . What are we gonna have that makes this thing better than
A :  Mm .
A :  Well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the Internet there is the opportunity that's presented , I guess .
D :  Right . Yeah . No , I I agree with you . So what I'm talking about is I see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . So that's that's that was my reactions .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . So we're quite fixed . So we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . Yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Yep .
C :  Yeah bu but we we're designing only the remote , we not design the T_V_ . So uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any T_V_
D :  Okay .
A :  Hmm .
C :  that we people use our remote with .
D :  Yeah . 'Kay .
D :  That's right . I think we take with you .
A :  Hmm .
C :  So it's kind of a stupid decision .
A :  But there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext . For example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible . Twenty-five Euros is the selling price , we really have to innovate here I guess .
B :  Right .
D :  That's what I'm that's what I'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext . Okay . 'Cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext .
A :  Mm .
A :  K yeah .
D :  So so it's it's not that I'm criticizing the product at all . It's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? What are we bringing in to take the place of this , and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up . If we lose one we need to bring two or three .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay I think that the last point is probably quite uh straightforward . Obviously the the w it has to be branded .
C :  So then the double R_ will be our our
A :  'Kay .
A :  On the product yeah . Can you handle that black and yellow ?
B :  I think one of
C :  I tho I tho I thou
C :  I think Rol Ro Rolls-Royce might mind , but don't worry .
B :  I think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this I mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . So I think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote and we want it to be functional as well , but I think one of the main selling points is that
B :  we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here . You know we don't wanna a big clunker . We want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so
A :  Mm .
D :  So you have this ?
A :  Nah .
A :  So we have three presentations , and I think we'll go in
A :  order of participant number here .
A :  So we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . That's
C :  Yes .
A :  Okay .
B :  That's fine .
B :  Okay so
A :  Mm it's enough . But uh click it on off ?
B :  so you all know me , I'm the Industrial Designer .
B :  And we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need , just basically every remote'll need 'em . We need some kinda of power d power source . Um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , but the in user interface is also a major component . Um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh
B :  into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red L_E_D_ , which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal .
B :  You need a on-off switch um I don't know how that got in there . And uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of T_V_s . So we need to know all the different you know all the different signals and so that'll require some memory as well .
B :  Um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . You ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , and then passes that signal on to the infra-red L_E_D_ and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor .
B :  So those are the basic components that need to go into this and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around .
D :  Now is would this be considered just a standard uh um
B :  I think any des
D :  This is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here . We're talking about existing technology . Nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries .
B :  No .
B :  Right I think
B :  Yeah this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . We can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , I mean that I mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . But
D :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Do we have an idea of costs of different components ?
B :  Um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well . Um the L_E_D_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap .
A :  'Kay .
B :  So depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap . Um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ? No .
B :  Uh I don't have any figures right now . We uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that . Um but and I think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , I think .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  N okay .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm the shell ?
B :  Yeah . Basically yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  So yeah . That's all I have really .
A :  Okay . Thanks .
A :  And we have participant three , which I believe is Pedro .
C :  I
A :  I can give you that to click on .
C :  Hey mouse . Open .
A :  And you wanna get
C :  When we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun .
A :  View a slide show , that's what you wanna do , yeah ? Just go up to view .
B :  Click , don't Yeah .
C :  Uh .
A :  Mm 'kay
C :  This doesn't work . So yeah function design . Um you guys know me , Pedro , and um
C :  what I found is we want to do fashion and I think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically and try to aim for design . If basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad
C :  so we ma we have to make it look good . Um something cute and small . The big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . So we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at .
C :  And um although mo most people will buy s
C :  televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their the stations . There's no need to have that in the remote . So um
C :  um as for what I would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh I will change the colours on the on the logo , but um we should go for the user-oriented device , so simple controls and good ergonomics . Um and uh although I th I th I'm still here recommending the teletext so I'll remove that , I guess , but um we should go for the
A :  But I t I think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . So I I still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Because otherwise we're just going to I mean even if it's necessary or not , if you if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to k make because as far as I understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? So it should be in there .
B :  Right as far as i it's just uh the cost of an extra button . I mean software-wise there's really no difference . I think .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Isn't
D :  I have maybe a silly question . I in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext . I I don't understand how those two things are connected . How does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? I don't understand that .
A :  Well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh Internet through the T_V_ for example . So that might play on what we can do .
C :  Yeah the they're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that and now
B :  Scheduling .
B :  Um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know .
C :  Yeah and now you can c look it over Internet . But I still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities .
D :  Okay .
B :  I think I ha
D :  Yeah 'cause , yeah , I just I don't see the cross-over between computers and television . I mean I do see the cross-over in some sense , but but but but with the the remote is is used for television , okay . So so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote . S
B :  I agree .
C :  Yeah , but it's not happen yet . Yeah .
B :  Well for me
A :  Well you have digital T_V_ still already .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Unless you have a
B :  Yeah .
A :  Well there there is a for example on digital T_V_ systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example . A a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live T_V_ and things like that . They're just features from the Internet uh from computers are are coming into the T_V_ sort of under the covers , but you still use it through a teletext . So now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that . That's the thing . And all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and
B :  I think a lot of that's proprietary anyways . You're not gonna be able to , you , like command a TiVo with our remote . I don't think .
A :  Mm .
A :  But still there there's an opportunity . If if it's , for example , a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it .
C :  Yeah but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
C :  Well I dunno . One way the other teletext was there but I guess we can remove it or , you know , make two separate interface designs .
B :  I think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . Just you know
D :  Yeah I don't I don't see the logic . I I don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , I just I I but I'm not a tech-mind either . I just don't see the cross-over between computers and and and 'Cause we are designing something for a television , okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , and neither do I in fact .
A :  Bu uh .
A :  I'll communicate that back to those guys there a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway
A :  i if it doesn't affect the price . Um but I I think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe . I dunno I'm
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right it's just not Yeah .
D :  We are selling it to an existing market .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah but we're not putting some there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext . That's the problem .
D :  That's
D :  Yeah , and and , yeah , and and we're also marketing a product . It's what I'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product . So so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns . So if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ?
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm . So if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . 'Cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  I don't I don't see it , and to me if I'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design I'm gonna I'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . I need to make it special with a high price tag . I don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive . I want I want to market it as exclusive . So I would market this product it at eighty-nine Euros and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something th but but I don't think we have that flexibility .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five Euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard T_V_ so the place uh remote the then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high-priced basic remote . Does that make sense , huh ?
D :  No I no I I understand what you say , but what I'm what I'm , okay we probably need to move along , but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , and if I'm coming in with a with with twenty-five Euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am I going to give these people for this ? So that's just my question , but we can keep talking .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah we probably should . We we're doing alright for time .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Sorry that kinda cut into you there .
B :  Well
C :  No just I I would I would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . Um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe I'll come up with more concrete ideas . Right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um
B :  Right . I'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature that ar you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions . Where
B :  I think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their T_V_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their T_V_ . They want something that looks nice , that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it , that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . I think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share .
A :  Mm .
A :  So we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features . Is that
B :  I think the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits . Because I think as we as we add costs for things like uh for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , I think you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that ? Maybe five percent , you know , and how much
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  But we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this . Be a good idea . Uh sorry , I didn't mean to cut in . I'm not the boss . Okay .
B :  Right .
B :  Yeah okay . I'm sorry .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Sorry boss .
D :  Oh P Pedro , I just want to say quickly I I would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh .
D :  You know sell uh things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh um voice-activated . I know we're getting into some , I hope , some big money on this thing , but
A :  I think that's probably a question more for
D :  Is that for over here ? Okay , alright .
A :  for this guy here , yeah .
B :  Yeah . Well it's kinda both of us . Us us user interface .
A :  Is it ? Okay .
D :  That's
D :  'Cause uh and I think of voice-activated I think of of how many times I've I've lost my my remote and I can't find it . So some way that I can I can find my remote by clapping my hands or something uh and and so so um But this 's just something . I'm trying to find some bells and whistles 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ? What makes this thing attractive ? And it's only for televisions .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I was thinking about that .
B :  Then your lights would go off , though .
A :  Mm .
D :  So we everyth our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their V_C_R_s , their D_V_D_s , their their televisions and we're coming out with one remote for television only . And so to me we have to make this a really special product I I I don't s I really have to say I don't see the market niche for this product . At this price I don't see it yet . I'm I I go along with this , because this is what we're given to try to market , but I I don't see the market niche for this product
B :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market .
C :  But we th that should be design .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That should be the design basically . I think technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it .
B :  Right .
C :  We don't have the money to do it towards t f technology so we should we should aim at design . Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Have to do you have to do it in the box ? Okay well , so so that's up to you then to to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary .
A :  Okay .
D :  Maybe make it in the form of a gun . We can sell it in United States .
A :  I have a question uh for you . Does any of the um the features that Pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? In terms of making it work or the cost of that or
B :  I don't
B :  I think all these things are pretty standard . I think we'll be okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  'Kay . Cheers .
A :  Onto participant four .
D :  Well you know for marketing f marketing for me is uh and uh how do I go here ? Okay .
A : 
B :  Mm you can just click .
D :  Go go . Is that right ?
B :  No no no you just get off that . You just click anywhere .
D :  Ah-ha . Yeah , what for me is it um I d I don't know what I'm marketing right now , okay , 'til you spoke and when I wrote this , I don't know what I'm marketing . I just know that I I was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers .
D :  And so the th the twenty-five Euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . That's what we decided here . Um so what I did is I I decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . So what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  We're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is . So that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left . Um so I would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . So I say inspiration , so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself . Uh innovation I think fits into what we're talking about here with design . Uh cutting edge technology , I don't think we're gonna have that , these were ideas I was putting together ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  um unless we come up with some New Age product a as far as the casing is concerned . I I wanna make this thing something that I can identify as special in some way , so maybe we can have some I I talked about environmentally sensitive , uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . I don't know . These are just thoughts .
D :  Uh I wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation , that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . So to me it's about selling d uh our identity our corporate identity along with the product .
D :  Um what I found is that the projected costs are competitive .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh we're kind of in the middle of the market , but what I'm seeing is that the market is ready for I I identified new technology , but again , because what I see is budget restrictions and limitations , I don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . If if we could have a technological something
B :  I have an idea . And it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , and it may even fit into ergonomics , and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue .
D :  Mm p please .
A :  Mm .
B :  Um what we can do is , well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . Right ? And s for some people Yeah . Well maybe not a solar remote but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? Like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , so you'll always know where the remote is 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote ,
D :  Solar .
A :  Yeah .
D :  But solar
B :  and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . You never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries .
B :  And also you can I I think it's a good opportunity for the user design or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole . You know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself .
D :  Blah , I like it . I like the idea , but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double .
B :  It w it would increase the cost .
D :  But boy , we can sell this thing , because there's no batteries , it's environmentally sensitive , i we can identify it as a safer product in some form .
B :  And you could page the remote if you lose it . Maybe there's a button on the cradle .
D :  Yep , that's right . I really see But the cost i
A :  Now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ?
D :  No no . No no , we have t we have to change the end cost . There's uh I mean I don't see it anyway .
A :  We we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh
A :  Can we dl can we do that without uh changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ?
D :  Yeah , that's gonna be up to these guys . I my reaction is no , but
B :  what I can do is I can d look into ho well Pedro and I can look into how much this might increase our our costs and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be
D :  Well , see I I see I I'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . You know , let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty Euros , sixty Euros . Let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this . Just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the Rolls Royce of of remote controls .
B :  I I
D :  Every home's got to have it . If you don't have one , hey what kind of remote do you have ? Oh you've got one of those , oh fantastic , I want one of those too . I just don't have enough money right now .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I just don't know about that , because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level I think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering like being able to operate , you know , the D_V_D_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . Which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . And additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um
A :  Nah , I think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext .
B :  But I do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have .
D :  Yep , one one thing I don't understand is h they've they've given us this package , okay . Now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . They say they say okay here you go . They gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want , and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . I don't think it's our place to create their product for them , maybe it is . I don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh , but to me it's like , okay , you have got your here's our ideas , okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  And then let them look at those ideas and they say , yeah well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , you know we like this idea , this idea no , but to me it's it's about a choice , do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ?
D :  beca I I do not I do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now . I don't see it .
A :  Mm .
B :  I don I I d I have to disagree though . I think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote , and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . It does what they need . These aren't I I think that it
A :  And and th to get to back to another point , sorry uh uh for cutting in but , I th I think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple T_V_s , yeah , 'cause it's selling on its own . It's not going to be specifically for Hitachi T_V_s or or whatever .
B :  Right .
D :  Right .
B :  Right .
D :  No I understand that .
A :  So technologically , if I understand it , uh T_V_s T_V_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and D_V_D_ remotes . All you need to do is train them to the individual one , all you need to do is is know the the f like some four-digit code . So saying that it works with all T_V_s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with D_V_D_s and other things .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Nope , they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions . They've identified this product limita That's why I say I don't I don't see the market niche for this . If we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for D_V_D_s , V_C_R_s and everything , then I can see the market niche , but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext . And it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , because who wants just a television remote ? I don't .
C :  Yeah y y you you wouldn't
A :  Oh okay okay . We have done this .
C :  The interface will be different .
A :  I see .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right .
B :  Well here's
A :  And I I'd Mm sorry .
B :  Right .
B :  We he well here's my thing about that . If you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote . If it can't control if it can't control your your D_V_D_ player and a al if y if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote , that just you can throw all your other remotes away . I'm not gonna buy a d seventy-five Euro remote .
D :  That's right .
D :  I I I have a tendency to agree with you . I really do . That's why I say I quest I q I question the marketability of the product . I really question where we create the demand .
A :  So we really can't chase that .
B :  So I think what we So that's what I'm saying
A :  We're really looking for something basic . The the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time where I'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . We're selling more than just the product .
A :  We're trying to get mind-share about uh Real Reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics . We want people to eventually say , oh that's that's Real Reaction that's a good m make . It's reliable .
A :  And and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind-share by uh either being a fantastic product or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced , and solid . So if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking I think that's in itself an extremely big thing .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I think that's big .
D :  W okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area . So we can say low-cost uh uh um uh good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da . But what I'm saying is right now we're middle market .
C :  Good design .
A :  We only have a few minutes left .
A :  Is twenty-five Euros a mid-market price for a remote ? Okay .
D :  Yeah for for multi for a multi-function remote , that's a mid-market price . In a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen , nineteen Euro , and that's for the multi-functions , uh D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , uh catch-alls . And and they have 'em in a little box in the middle , and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . So to me , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness .
B :  I think so , yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  We have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , and I don't know what that is . It's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features .
A :  Well I'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it .
A :  If we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it , but we're really doing that to sell the brand . Yep we have five minutes left .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh rather th uh to to to sell for Real Reactions . And I can communicate this to to the more senior uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction .
D :  Or my d
B :  What about um the idea that I had with the cradle ? How do you feel about that ?
B :  Or how does everybody feel ?
A :  Well how does everybody feel ? I I think
D :  I mean I I well we g we're talking about the other end now . I like it . I like the idea , but we have t we have to find out
B :  No , but I that's the thing I I don't think it's necessarily the other end .
A :  The other the o the problem with that in my mind I just think off-hand as a as a consumer , would I wanna buy that ? And I think maybe not because I've got a remote and I'll take it to different chairs , I'll take it to different I w I don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , and that implies that there's only one T_V_ user . So it's very good for some people but it's not a like
B :  Right .
B :  Well it lasts it would last for several hours on its own power , but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle .
A :  But it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent . You have to l sort of remember . You have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and
B :  Yeah well it
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . I d I d I d I think it it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh I'd really want uh because of that fact . But I I don't know , that's just my opinion .
D :  Well .
D :  Mm .
D :  Well , I think again it's it we have a cost issue here . You know if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range . Are we gonna make this selling selling the cost as a high high-tech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ? Again I don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet . I don't see it yet .
A :  Mm .
A :  'Kay .
A :  So what do we think maybe we should Pedro , do you have any opinion on it ?
C :  Uh we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good .
D :  W a question I have in in a 'cause I I I think I agree with you on , we gotta make it a box . The box is gonna sell it I think , the outside , the casing . Can can can we have multiple designs ?
A :  Really need to wrap up now .
D :  Have a modern , have a traditional , have a you know , and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . I don't know what that creates cost , or
B :  Well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know . So
D :  Yep one over another . Yeah , okay , I hear that .
C :  Yeah , complicated but
B :  Um but what we could do is some kind of well I mean
B :  Yeah we we need to , I mean , have a few designs to look at and then come up with something that I think we all agree is , you know , the best fit . I think w what's really important is it has to look good , it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand , it has to be durable , it has to a and I think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . I think I think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote . Even though the cost may be low .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  What ab what ab what about a
D :  a remote that's that doesn't maybe look like a remote ?
D :  Just an idea . Just just okay 'cause I mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside . They're selling these things everywhere . Maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote it it opens like a telephone .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Or what if it looks like a pen ?
D :  Doesn't matter , yeah . I'm just jus I talking about some something to make this thing unique . It That's the thing , I'm gonna keep thumping on . I'll sell whatever you guys design . I don't have a problem selling a product , that's not the issue . I give you ideas , you guys create the product . Once you have the finished product I'll find a way to sell it . Don't worry about it . I just give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings .
B :  Yeah .
B :  A pointer ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  just to touch on m my point one last time that I had brought up . Um I really un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own ,
B :  I think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Yeah .
B :  Because I really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me I would want to have that just , because I know at the end of when I'm done watching T_V_ that when I'm done , oh I better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . Maybe th th th that's just some people that like that . A lot of people
D :  No no .
A :  I mean there's al there's also remote controls I remember that that worked uh , this hasn't been done in a while I think , but th as a as a watch . Yeah , there is remote control watches um , but I think they're a sorta eighties thing , so it might not be easy to market in it uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now . Those things may have been inexpensive for all I know .
B :  As a watch ? Mm 'kay .
C :  Yeah they are not simple .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  One thing I just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken We gotta stop ? Who's lost or broken their their remote . So how many remotes do they wanna buy ? Can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? And so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ? How does this happen ?
B :  That's what I was saying .
A :  Gotta cut up .
B :  Exactly .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  The last remote you'll ever buy .
B :  And also presumably they've
D :  And and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy .
A :  Well if if we're going down that then we can we don't need to go the it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make . Whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all because that's just done with mobile phones you can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there .
B :  Exactly .
B :  Yeah .
B :  True .
B :  Right .
B :  Yeah . The locator'll definitely be more expensive .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um need to look into whether we can do that but uh I think we we have some m mobile phone-based products uh checking quickly our Internet . We really need to finish up here . But uh
D :  uh we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot .
A :  Yeah we have the the power-adaptor products . We sell power-adaptor products . So for example there's nothing stopping us
D :  It's uh just it's that I think it's telling us to stop our meeting . So we have the c we probably have have on-line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we're talking about .
A :  using that technology . Yeah .
A :  Yeah I think so , without it being too In fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here .
D :  A charging system .
B :  Right .
D :  If if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics .
B :  Right . I think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery . You know , something like that .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yep .
A :  'Kay . Thanks guys .
C :  Yep .
D :  No that's not what I want , I want
D :  Oh look it here .
A :  So we can start ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Suppose I have to do my presentation . Eh um
C :  Ah okay .
C :  It's Ada Longmund ?
A :  So , I'll present myself , I'm Ada Longmund , and as you may know it , I'm the pr project manager .
A :  So um we will have to
A :  um speak about m the project . Our project project is to create um a new remote control and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly .
A :  Record .
A :  So the project method is the following .
A :  So if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . Uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design .
A :  Uh .
A :  The tool training is to try out the white board , so
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard , yeah ?
A :  Maybe you can draw your favourite animal
A :  and make a list of its favourite characteristics .
D :  So right now ?
A :  I don't know if we have to do it now , maybe later later .
B :  So yeah I think you can do it .
C :  Yeah , I don't know .
A :  So the selling price of the product will be twenty five Euros . Yeah . Yeah . I think it's quite good price , yeah . And uh
B :  Twenty five Euros ?
D :  Mm .
C :  I it's it's reasonable , s quite yeah . Twenty five .
D :  It's reasonable , I think , yeah .
C :  Is
A :  it will uh be a
A :  an international remote control , as we want to sell it in the entire world , and the product costs will be not more than twelve Euros and fifty centimes . So , as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control . Um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls , try to create something new and people would like to to buy .
A :  And and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes ,
A :  so you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role and you know I suppose you know what you have to do . And uh you will have to work on the design and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control and think of the user requirement specifications .
C :  Yeah . I I hope so
D :  Those things just refer to each of each of us , I think . AMI and okay .
B :  Yep .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I_D_ , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So
C :  I_D_ is for the Industrial Design , yeah ?
D :  Okay .
C :  And U_I_D_ , it's for the User Interface Designer , yeah ?
B :  That's me .
D :  Okay , and Marketing Expert , it's me .
C :  AMI yeah project .
A :  So I will manage all all the group .
C :  you will be the manager yeah .
D :  You can manage all this , yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Good .
A :  So you have questions ?
D :  Um .
D :  Not really .
A :  So you all know what the parts of the work you have to do .
B :  Yeah .
D :  So which you , the Industrial Designer .
B :  No I'm user interf I'm user interface design .
C :  I am the Industrial Design , yeah
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm . And you ?
C :  I am the Industrial Designer so .
A :  Mm okay .
B :  Okay . So what's the difference between
D :  Yeah .
B :  user interface design d industrial design ?
A :  Hmm .
D :  I mean , you have to know . Ah , you have to know it .
C :  It's difficult .
D :  It's your job , so I hope you you know what it is .
C :  You know very soon .
B :  Yeah , I think so .
C :  So
D :  Mm .
A :  I suppose you have to design it and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it .
B :  Okay , so I make uh u user interface . You you de you implement the core functions in the
D :  Yeah .
A :  And i maybe you will transform it .
C :  I I think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so
B :  Use it .
B :  Make make yeah .
C :  And the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like .
B :  Maybe I think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design . I design the user f user interface , you design the function .
C :  Yeah . So the materi
A :  Maybe , it is the outside and the inside .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay right . But I was thinking that he's a user 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know .
B :  Yeah yeah .
C :  But I don't know . Okay .
D :  Well . You know .
C :  I'm the industrial designer .
D :  Oh , okay , okay . Not the other one .
C :  So .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  So and the marketing expert will
D :  Yeah , I'm just go I'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have and then thi this would I guess converged to the User Interface Designer wi and then Industrial Designer .
A :  And yeah .
C :  Ok Okay .
A :  And when designing y the remote control just remember that uh it has to be a kind of international product . So you don't have to do something really specific , as everybody everybody will have to use it , it's sor the same as keyboards . You know , you have Qwerty , Azerty , French and U_K_ keyboard , so really the remote control to be international . And not too expensive .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . And uh simple .
A :  As we want to maximise the benefit .
B :  And easy to use .
D :  And you have to keep it under twelve Euros and f fifty , so .
A :  Yeah , you have to keep in mind that the product cost won't be maxim more than twelve dot fifty Euros .
B :  Ah , yeah .
D :  That's the problem .
C :  It should be
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  And to be sure that really people will be interested in buying a new remote control with maybe new functionalities that don't exist in the mm existing remote controls now .
B :  Okay .
A :  So , is it okay ?
D :  Mm . It's clear .
B :  Yeah .
C :  There was a step about drawing something in the in the board , I don't know .
D :  Yeah , maybe should go and draw an animal .
C :  Is it ? Are we supposed to do right now ?
B :  Yeah yeah , you try . Try first .
C :  Oh right it's it's from the left to the ri It's
A :  So you think we have to do it now ?
C :  I d I was thinking but I n I'm not sure now .
B :  You can draw something which is very simple .
C :  Oh
A :  You want me to draw something ? Product manager okay , let's go , I will try .
C :  Everybody
B :  Oh , maybe we should bring Kemy here . Kemy is really good at drawing .
D :  Many
C :  I think everybody should do it , so .
D :  Yeah .
C :  It's not matter
C :  So .
B :  You're going to draw ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Uh it's the same as mine .
C :  yeah . It's a It's a cat .
B :  What's this ?
B :  It's a fat cat .
C :  It is not a fat cat .
D :  It's the fat cat , okay .
C :  Yeah , it is a
B :  Can you draw uh um rabbit ? Oh , hat ha rat .
D :  A rat ? That's difficult .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes you have to draw a rat if you want a rat . It's your rat .
A :  No . A mouse is not too difficult . Mouse is okay .
B :  Yeah , it's okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Just go , you you the closest to the whiteboard .
C :  Okay , go
C :  right , but in grow , it's everybody has to grow
B :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Oh . Okay , I draw . The only thing I can draw is like this .
B :  Oh .
B :  Oh . Oh .
D :  A duck .
B :  No . What's this ?
A :  You love the eyes .
C :  What are you I don no idea , so
A :  Yeah , that was the eyes .
B :  Okay .
A :  A clown . Rabbit .
C :  It's a rabbit .
D :  Pikachu .
A :  It's a rabbit .
D :  Oh yeah .
D :  Bugs Bunny one .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  It's not so bad so .
B :  The only thing I can draw , because it's very simple .
D :  Okay . I go .
A : 
D :  What ? Oh . So what else ? This was my favourite one , but
C :  So you don't have a
A :  Thank you .
C :  A fish .
D :  Right . A fish .
C :  That's a that's a fish ? Okay , let's try to draw something .
A :  You forgot the chips .
D :  Oh yeah , doesn't look so fine .
C :  Have to be really careful .
A :  Fish and chips .
D :  Okay , it's your turn .
C :  Ah it's my turn .
B :  Oh .
B :  Okay , be careful .
C :  Okay .
C :  So .
C :  It's ok So , what can I draw some more ?
B :  No problem , no problem .
A :  Oh . ?
C :  ? No .
C :  Mm
B :  .
C :  Yeah , it's it's a se it's my priority this one .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  A person ?
C :  No .
C :  It's a really crazy dog
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  Dog .
C :  Okay . Transfer . It's a dog in a village .
D :  Good .
B :  Okay .
B : 
C :  So what are you sug going to do now ?
D :  I think it's done .
A :  Yeah , I think yeah .
C :  It's done ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Just have to
B :  So we have break .
A :  present project , discuss a little bit about it .
C :  Oh my God .
D :  Oh , we have twenty five minutes for the meeting .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  So , if you have questions .
B :  Oh .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Know what time is it ?
D :  No .
B :  No .

A :  You know your job ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Good .
A :  Okay . Good morning everybody . Oh , everybody is not ready .
C :  Good morning .
B :  Uh almost .
B :  Ready .
A :  Alright . Okay , let's go . So , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes .
A :  Um so I will be uh Sebastian the Project Manager . Um you are the
B :  I'm uh Michael . I'm the user interface designer .
A :  Okay .
D :  Hi I'm Guillermo . I'm the Marketing Expert .
C :  And I am Hemant , the industrial designer .
A :  Okay , very good . Thanks for being here . Um so let's have a look to the the agenda .
A :  So , we are going to go through this agenda uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here . Um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it .
A :  So , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control . Um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly .
A :  As usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company . It is in three step as you know . First the functional design . The second's a conceptual design , and then the detailed design .
A :  During each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next .
A :  So first , we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings . So who want to start ?
A :  Mister .
B :  Ah well if no one else wants to , yeah .
B :  Okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal . Let's see .
B :  Well , I don't really have a favourite animal , but um uh I think I have one in mind , so uh
A :  You have one in mind ?
B :  I'm gonna about the uh spider because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board .
B :  The spider has a spider lives in a web
B :  and uh
B :  it has eight legs ,
B :  and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions .
B :  Unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . There are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web .
B :  And uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else .
B :  So I think they did this in uh in Charlotte's Web that movie that little uh well it's actually a book first but uh
B :  um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . So , that's my animal .
A :  Okay . Th thank you . Very interesting . Guillermo you want to ?
D :  'kay
D :  I dunno why , but when I was a child I I wanted to be a a panther not a pink panther , or maybe yes .
C :  But don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther ?
A :  It would be very funny for us .
D :  Uh yeah yeah .
C :  So bad I don't like it .
C : 
A :  Oh .
D :  Okay it's a friendly panther .
B :  Maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone .
D :  Yeah maybe .
D :  Um .
D :  Actually , honestly I I I dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour , I dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh , I I I have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt , so but
D :  I like it because it's fast , and it's black as well , so it can
D :  he it can hide itself very easily and it's it's it looks like um powerful , strong , uh I dunno .
D :  I I watch a a film about a black panther when I was a child and I was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot . Okay .
A :  Okay . Thank you . Hemant .
C :  Um sure .
B :  So you don't like pink panthers ?
D :  I like it .
C :  Oh yeah . Thanks .
C :  This lapel is coming out once in a while . It's not very strong .
C :  Okay . So , not the favourite animal , but I think I'll draw elephant . I'll try to draw elephant . It's a problem .
C :  Okay , thanks . Okay so , elephant goes like this ,
C :  and then it has
C :  four feet . I don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but
C :  I think this is the easiest . And then we have it's trunk .
C :  yep something like this . An eye , cute . Yeah , so
A :  Poor elephant .
C :  and sometimes they have a hump . It seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly and they they have one very important way a different way of walking . So when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . When they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . That's the way they walk .
C :  And that's very peculiar about them . None of the other animals walk like this . And they are very useful to human beings .
C :  At least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful .
C :  And they are found in um usually the warm countries . And um they are the biggest terrestrial animal . That's what I know about them . So , that's what I wanted to tell about elephants .
B :  So is this uh an Indian or an African elephant , 'cause you haven't drawn the ears ?
C :  There are two kind of uh yeah , they are very different , Indian and African elephants . So Indian elephant is having one bump , I think , and the African have two . And then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals , these elephants who are Indian and
C :  So at some for some elephants it's the trunk is having one
C :  Do we have some message there ?
A :  Yes . We have to I have to catch you , sorry . We have to to go through the meeting . Thank you .
C :  Wind up ? Okay , some other time . Thank you .
B :  Okay .
B :  We can discuss that off-line .
A :  Yeah we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants .
C :  Thanks .
A :  So so another important part of the project is about money , uh and about so about finances . So we should target selling price of twenty-five Euro for this remote control
A :  and uh we have um which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million Euros , okay . And we should target the inter an international market .
B :  So could I just ask one question , um
B :  is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? So it's gonna be you already have a T_V_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ?
A :  O this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly , so let's go to it .
B :  Okay , alright .
A :  So um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go . Should be should should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ? Should it be a universal one ? And uh etcetera .
A :  So um so I'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly because we have only three three minutes to go .
B :  Okay well , so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , which seems to
B :  a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet , but I guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that
B :  that price bracket so , I guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know , what people ar are willing to pay for um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five Euro because it seems quite a lot for a remote control , so it's
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay I think this is more a job to our market person yeah . So it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go .
C :  Marketing person .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So we need to close the meeting . Uh we'll have a new meeting soon and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do .
A :  So um you have to work on the on the working design , you have to uh work on the technical functions , and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs , alright ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um you will receive some information by emails , i as usual . Thanks for coming today . Thanks .
B :  Okay . Alright .
C :  Thanks .
B :  Now what .
A :  'Kay , hello everybody . Uh , I guess you all know what is it about , you all received the email , I guess . Uh , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control . So I'm going to be the project manager of this uh project .
A :  And uh so I'm present myself . I'm Fabien Cardinaux and uh I I guess you can present yourself .
A :  So I dunno , you can starts .
B :  Okay , so my name is Petre . You can call me Petre , or Peter if you like . I don't care .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh my name's Bob Mor . Oh , sorry .
A :  And you are ? In the project ?
B :  Uh , in the project I'm supposed to be the technic .
D :  'Kay . So my name's Bob Morris . I'm the Marketing Expert for this project . Bob yeah .
B :  Bob , okay .
C :  My name is Hamed Getabdar , and uh I'm going to be Interface Designer in this project .
B :  Okay .
A :  So , uh , so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project , so um
A :  We are gooding we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project . We are talking about the project plan , and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , and , yeah . So we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting .
A :  Um . So what is the goal of this project ? Is to design a new remote control . So it should be , of course , new and original , and um it should be trendy , and user friendly . That mean it's a very challenging project , and uh
A :  uh . So w it's we will try to do our best , and hopefully come with something very new and that
A :  people want to buy .
A :  So , um
A :  So what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project ? So it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way .
A :  Um .
A :  Yeah and everything is will be like this .
A :  Um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project . So we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . So uh . For example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
A :  Uh . So uh
A :  So I will ask you all to do the same . Just to get used to the whiteboard .
B :  Okay .
B :  So probably I would try to try to draw the animal . Well sh should I draw the picture of the animal ? I I th I think I should .
D :  Yeah go ahead .
A :  Yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course .
B :  Okay , so .
B :  Um .
B :  Okay , American , um . Um . I would use the bird .
B :  So I tried to sketch it out .
B :  I had to first uh write it down because I am not absolutely sure if I can draw it , but ah .
B :  Can you recognise it as a bird ?
B :  Okay it's your turn to
D :  Okay , okay .
D :  So I think my favourite animal would be a c a cat .
A :  Oh .
D :  That's its head . Um I probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful .
D :  Okay .
C :  I dunno if I should go with this .
B :  Oh it's okay .
D :  Thanks .
C :  If it is enough line . I'm sorry .
D :  Maybe put it up Put it a Maybe put it on the desk or something .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I should get used to the tool , so . Oh just wait a little bit . C could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ? Ah probably not .
C :  Okay .
C :  They should be remote .
B :  Okay , it it works like this .
D :  Uh , that's better .
C :  Okay , thanks .
D :  Your lapel microphone's fallen off .
B :  Are you left-handed ? Oh , pity .
C :  No .
C :  Okay . Should I clean ?
C :  Okay , I think like horses uh because they are strong and beautiful , so if I want to write it here , I think I can .
C :  Oh .
A :  Never mind .
B :  Ah , it's maybe better if you leave it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Maybe we should just continue . Yeah , don't worry about it .
A :  Yeah .
A :  , no worry .
D :  No .
C :  Okay .
B :  You won't draw them , or ?
A :  You can draw it , if you want .
C :  I dunno if I can . Okay . It may be like a cow or I dunno , whatever . I'm not good very good in drawing . Okay , so this is very It's a bird , I think . I dunno what is it .
B :  Just try . I would like to see how it looks like .
B :  No , I think it's clear .
C :  Four .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . I'm shameful Yeah . Okay .
D :  Oh that's good , it's good .
B :  It's okay . It's in it's indeed beautiful .
A :  Good .
D :  Yeah , and strong .
B :  Okay .
B :  Bob . Have to remember it .
B :  Bob .
A :  So good um So , let's talk about money . Uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five Euro Euro . And uh our expected profit will be around fifty million Euro .
A :  And uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world .
A :  So n not only for Switzerland , but for the world .
A :  Uh .
A :  So , um .
A :  The We expect a production cost of maximum
A :  uh twelve point fifty Euro .
B :  Per unit , I guess . Y oh okay .
A :  Yeah , of course .
A :  Um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? So , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . Anything .
B :  Okay .
D :  Well , from experience , um I've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . Um and and normally you only every use , you know , on a T_V_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . Um .
A :  Mm .
B :  Oh .
D :  So it's frustrated me in the past , th that .
B :  Okay , I have also some points uh . Maybe two points . Uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . And maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . So something like this .
A :  Yeah .
B :  And the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control . But I prefer like a potential-meter or something like .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Ah , okay . Okay .
B :  You know , some slider or Not just two discrete buttons for volume , but something which
A :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay , n
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Is that because the of the discrete volume levels , or is that
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but I can reach In uh one second I can mute it down , or or make a high volume .
A :  Are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly and it can
D :  Yeah .
B :  Ah , n .
B :  If it drops to the floor then it starts to scream .
A :  Yeah , also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and
B :  Yeah , f It depends what what you feel about that .
A :  you have a heart attack .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , but if you have some more notes on that .
A :  Yeah so you can Do you have something ?
C :  Uh I Yeah , just a simple experience . I uh I prefer um remote control working with radio waves , because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune .
A :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  Yeah without obstacles and .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Let's continue . I have a meeting in five minutes , so maybe we should hurry . Um . So we will close uh this meeting . So we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes .
B :  Um .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay , just a second .
A :  Um .
A :  Uh . The So I will ask you to do some work . Uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , start to to have new idea and
B :  Which i which is Hamed , ? Okay .
A :  read about Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  He's the Industrial Designer ? No , you're the Industrial Designer .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Uh I am the Technical Designer , I dunno which one , uh v .
A :  Oh .
D :  Yeah , I think that's the first . I_D_ . Industrial Designer . And the second one is the User Interface Designer .
A :  Industry and Oh .
C :  Uh-huh .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  User Interf Okay .
D :  And then last one's marketing , which is me .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , so I'm the first one .
A :  So , um
A :  For the User Interface Designer , which is Hamed um ,
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  uh , you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control .
B :  I see .
C :  Okay .
A :  And for the Marketing uh
A :  Manager , I dunno , okay , which is Bob , uh
A :  you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control .
A :  Um , you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach .
B :  Sign .
A :  Yep finished .
A :  So I see you in thirty minutes .
D :  Great , okay . Thanks guys . Bye .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay , thanks . Bye .
A :  Thank you .
B :  Uh .
B :  Oops .
A :  So , hello everyone . We're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control . I'm the Project Manager Christa Pavlov and okay let's begin .
A :  So
A :  I'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting .
A :  So um we want to to do a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy and user friendly .
A :  Um I think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design .
A :  and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day .
A :  Um , so let's try the whiteboard . Um so any of you who want to go .
D :  Wow .
B :  Yeah , for favourite animals . It's gonna be not my favourite one but the one I can draw . And it's gonna be you'll try to guess .
D :  Wow .
D :  Complex .
A :  Wow .
D :  Huh ?
D :  A cat .
C :  No .
B :  No .
D :  No . Darn .
D :  Uh .
A :  A rabbit .
B :  Yes , that's a rabbit . That's my favourite one .
D :  A what ?
A :  A rabbit .
D :  A r a rabbit , oh oh yeah , where is the carrot ? Okay mm-hmm .
C :  Rabbit .
B :  That's it .
A :  You want to go ?
D :  I am not very good at uh this kind of stuff . My favourite animal is
B :  Hmm .
C :  You wa
B :  Wow .
A :  A human ah .
D :  Guess . A human , yay . It's a very complex animal and um yeah . Characteristics of this this animal is dangerous .
B :  No .
A :  Mm I think you're supposed to , yeah .
C :  Is the white okay .
A :  Hmm .
C :  I guess you can .
B :  Wow . That's cobra .
D :  Ah , a kind of uh snake ? Cobra ? Exactly .
C :  Yeah uh not really . Small cobra .
B :  No , it just small cobra , yeah .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  Is that a worm ? Or
B :  It's co c quite recognisable .
D :  What about you uh Christa ?
A :  Uh yeah Christa Pavlov Mm .
C :  Chris .
B :  Christa Christa .
D :  A fish .
C :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Smiling fish .
C :  Smile fish .
B :  Okay .
D :  A smiling fish . Mm-hmm . So , w whiteboard is working ? Good . Next .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Next . Let's talk about money .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Just tr try to guess who is a User Interface Designer . According to the drawings . Okay .
D :  Yeah , well .
C :  Yeah , you're
D :  Not me .
A :  So .
D :  So . Twenty five Euro for a remote control .
A :  Yeah , mm that's the price we want to that's the aim for the price for the remote control . We aim to do this profit .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Okay .
D :  'tis big number .
B :  On the international market .
A :  Yeah . Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , we're to sell two million then .
B :  Wow .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty Euros maximum .
A :  'Kay .
A :  So any of you have experience in remote controls ?
D :  Uh yes , we have plenty at home . In fact , my daughter likes l remote controls . To eat ? Yeah , mainly , and to break .
C :  Mm yeah .
A :  That
B :  Mm . To eat ?
A :  So that could be a great um application . Remote controls children proof . Mm mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Yeah . Ye ye yeah .
B :  Children proof .
B :  Hmm .
D :  So she likes uh buttons which make click , so it has to click .
C :  Yeah , pret
A :  Okay .
A :  So they have to be waterproof maybe ? 'Cause they eat she ate it .
D :  It has to be uh wha baby proof yeah but mainly it has to be very robust because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Ah .
D :  So it has to be very robust .
B :  Okay , unbreakable .
D :  Unbreakable , yeah .
C :  Yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah .
B :  Uh-huh .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And uh
D :  it has to be nice looking ,
C :  Yeah .
D :  colourful , maybe
A :  Colourful , yeah mm .
B :  Colourful ? That's not practical .
D :  colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control , they're always black , yeah , but this one could be I dunno , purple or b
C :  Yeah .
A :  No , that's a good idea .
C :  Yeah , it's always black or yeah .
A :  Mm mm-mm .
B :  No .
B :  But how gonna okay , just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  No , because you think , why not .
C :  Yeah .
D :  One colour .
B :  Otherwise you will never find it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah even we can change colours , no ? Like the uh like the phones and these things we c yeah . At least for children like one colour and .
D :  Oh like the phones , yeah , it could change colours , yeah .
B :  Cool .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Good .
A :  Good idea .
C :  And it should be really small and .
A :  Small also ? Don't you think
C :  Huh not so big like yeah .
A :  No uh , not too much buttons or mm .
C :  Yeah , not too much buttons and
D :  Should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator whatever I dunno if it's
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's
D :  Or if we should have a targeted re remote control .
A :  Okay .
D :  So colour , robustness , easy to use , size , yeah , size matters , yeah .
A :  So , I think there's
C :  Yeah . Colour , size , sh
A :  So you you think it's better if small
A :  than bigger .
C :  Yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this I guess .
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . Okay .
A :  No , not too small , yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah , at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah , like a palm sized .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  Just to hold it .
A :  Okay .
D :  But uh what would be different from this , from the others ? I dunno if
C :  Uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame . Mm . S so then it depends you are to
D :  Yeah , at least the colour would be different .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm I mean you c you can easily remove the frame .
D :  I think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  For some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , I dunno .
A :  Mm . So , some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what no .
B :  No , no screens , it's too complex .
A :  Okay .
D :  Too expensive for twelve Euro ?
C :  Mm . Too expensive , yeah .
B :  And n maybe not too expensive , well it's not my problem , but well okay . But no screens on remote controls .
A :  And too expensive .
D :  Ah .
D :  Mm-hmm . I thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user .
A :  Mm .
D :  So ma I prefer to have the off button at the top right , so I would have my own design of the remote control because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , if you if you like .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Ye yeah .
C :  Hmm .
C :  I mean it it's like it's like two types no ? people are right handed or left handed so y because I am left handed I use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this or so tha your switch on and off should be on yeah .
D :  I don't know if it makes sense , but
A :  Mm-mm .
D :  Yeah , for instance , mm .
B :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm mm mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  So adaptable yeah something yeah .
B :  Adaptable . Alright , good , so how many actions do we need to implement in it ?
D :  Maybe , if if it's possible , yeah .
C :  Mm huh .
B :  On off ?
C :  Maybe I think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working .
D :  Yeah .
C :  We can adapt only one switch , suppose here like we can make two switches and if I'm left-hander I use this switch to follow the main operations .
B :  I mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a
C :  Two .
D :  Three buttons you mean ?
B :  like three mental states , yeah you know what I mean , we can just make it uh
A :  Three option .
D :  Ah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
B :  controlled by a brain , huh ?
A :  Mm-hmm . Maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside that ask you three
D :  Mm-hmm , yeah , sure .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D : 
A :  Hmm . If it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may
A :  may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah .
B :  Sh sure , sure .
D :  Yeah , more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time .
C :  Mm yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else .
D :  Yeah but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  And that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five .
B :  Mm-hmm . You do this ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Uh no . Because I'm only using three or four channels but
B :  I usually just change channels .
C :  Yeah . But they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah , you can only have one bit .
A :  Yeah . I change channel like this , m uh I want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah .
C :  Dash .
D :  And then back to the one I was before , so there's whichever it was .
A :  Also we can be here yeah , that would be cool .
B :  Uh-huh . Go back button is good . I once had it .
C :  Yeah you can yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Uh uh we had that in in other countries . Yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous .
C :  Yeah yeah , the previous button is .
A :  Mm yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh , okay .
B :  History .
C :  Oh uh .
D :  Then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions , that becomes more complex , but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls . Yeah maybe it's a
C :  Uh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah , what the which channels the viewer
A :  Mm-mm .
A :  Okay . So I think we have full of idea .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes and uh I want you to mm
A :  work on these ideas and try to make a
A :  uh the ones , make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want .
A :  And um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do .
A :  Um .
A :  So um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes .
D :  So what does M_E_ means ? M_E_ the user requirements ? Or that's uh that's for us ?
B :  Market Expert .
C :  Marketing yeah .
D :  Uh that's me . Oh , of course yeah , the user requirement specifications , uh-huh , yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay . I'll think of that .
A :  Mm okay .
A :  So .
D :  So ?
A :  I think that's all .
D :  Meeting's over ? Great .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Thank you .
D :  Thank you .
B :  Thank you everybody .
A :  See you in thirty minutes .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Good morning everybody .
C :  Good morning .
D :  Good morning .
B :  Good morning .
A :  So , we are asked to
A :  to make uh uh a new remote control for television .
A :  And the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and
A :  trendy and of course user user friendly .
A :  So people can can use it without any
A :  any problem .
A :  .
A :  I don't know .
B : 
C :  Well , I think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh
B :  Mm .
B :  B did you send us an email about this ?
A :  Uh , not yet , but if you want
B :  Yeah , we we received an email about this uh d designs .
A :  Do you want do you want me to send you a mail ?
B :  Ah it's Okay .
A :  Or
D :  Or you can put it in the shared folder .
B :  Yeah , you see the email ? You email . The v very no , no the first one . It's inside .
D :  No , I didn't get it .
A :  Uh
D :  This one . No .
B :  No , no . The third one .
B :  Oh , you didn't get anything .
D :  No , .
B :  It's strange .
B :  Mm . I got an email about the dis about the discussion . Yeah .
A :  .
A :  You get email , .
B :  I dunno from who . From the account manager . You have received the same email , right ? Yeah .
C :  Yeah , from the account manager .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I think so .
B :  Yeah , so each of us has a role to do .
D :  Yeah I think assign your uh roles .
B :  In each
A :  For each for each one .
B :  We already have our role .
D :  For each person , yeah .
B :  'Kay , we can
A :  So there are so we have three f yeah . We have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design .
B :  So there are three kinds of designs , that's all .
B :  Okay , alright .
A :  So , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? Any any volunteer ?
C :  I think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  I'm doing the interface .
A :  You are doing th
C :  No , I'm doing the interface .
A :  .
B :  Are you using the you are doing the in
C :  Yeah I I'm I'm
C :  Well , maybe we have okay so I industrial design .
C :  It was a little confusion about my uh but it's alright .
B :  Ah
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay , I'll for industrial design .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  And and you
A :  Norman ?
B :  Mm ? Um working on i .
C :  User .
B :  User interface .
A :  And
A :  And
D :  Uh , I'm into marketing . yeah nothing much in the project .
A :  doing the marketing .
A :  Nothing related here to the
D :  Marketing in this design . A design is basically for industrial design and the user interface .
B :  Yes .
B :  You see the second mail ?
B :  Yeah , it's inside . Go down .
B :  Appendix .
D :  Yeah , this is .
B :  See there's a role for everybody .
D :  Yeah , that's right , first .
B :  Even for the marketing .
D :  us user define .
B :  But look at your role , your marketing role .
A :  Next .
D :  There's a trend watching .
A :  I don't know . I .
B :  Yeah , that's your role .
C :  Well , I think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done and what are your ideas about the
A :  About the design or
A :  Maybe we'll discuss this later , no ?
C :  Well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for T_V_ distribution I guess .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  how we can make it work .
B :  Yes .
D :  I mean working remotes we already have . This will be something different from the other remotes remote controls .
C :  Yeah , I dunno I
A :  What we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . And of course it should not be very costly .
D :  Yeah , that's right .
A :  So
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well I I think that Norman and I would think about um the technical points and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or
B :  Need to collect information .
C :  Yeah .
A :  About the about what ?
B :  Um .
B :  I I'm part of design , perhaps .
B :  Uh , what is most important in a
B :  in a remote control ?
B :  What is the most important function aspect ?
B :  Uh .
A :  You mean the external or
C :  Well , you have to make it work . That's the that's the big thing .
A :  Yeah of g of course .
B :  That's alright .
B :  Yeah , it should be easy to work with .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  We can think about an interface with uh well
B :  Uh . We maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . You just tell the television I want which channel . Or or you can say for example , um
A :  You won't
B :  I want uh to list all the programme tonight . Y you know , instead of uh remote control it's doing the some searching for you , so you don't have to look for the channel you want . Just say maybe I just want to press I wanna have a button for all the movies tonight .
B :  Or a button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight . And then you list a few , and I will choose from the list . So instead of pressing the channel number , I am choosing the programmes directly . Yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  I I think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly .
B :  No , because no , it's not very a lot . Th this information exists . For example you can get um
A :  S
A :  Like s uh you you you say we can use speech .
B :  You can use uh well for example anything . The the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . Yeah .
C :  I
C :  I think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh I dunno
D :  I'm a okay .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  I mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . If we are going to add a speech interface , I'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that I think the T_V_ itself could have it .
A :  In the hand .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yes , possible .
B :  Yeah . But
C :  Yeah .
D :  And I could talk to the T_V_ television itself . I need not have an
A :  Except if if you are far from the T_V_ .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I mean we have some or something , different technology but
A :  This is it's
B :  Yeah , yeah . But th the main idea I wanted to s I wanted to say is that um there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch T_V_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either T_V_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . So it's more powerful .
C :  On the content .
D :  Mm-hmm , yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea but I I think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  No .
B :  No , because you see now all the T_V_ programmes are available on the webs . They they are they are they are available in X_M_L_ format or whatever the format . We don't care . We just say that this are some content . We just want to retrieve the content and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . Some of the websites they already provide this service , so we can just use the service available . Download it uh to the to this remote control . And then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . The most there are only seven buttons . So I just choose the category one and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , you just have six buttons , seven buttons .
C :  Yeah yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Well I I I I think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the
A :  This is good idea .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Ah , yes . So .
C :  Well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , so you don't have to display here , just display on the T_V_ screen , right ? Good idea .
C :  Yeah in the dis display on the T_V_ screen and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f
B :  Okay .
B :  I think I think that will be revol revolutionary . Because all the T_V_ uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons and then you dunno what to choose in the end . Yeah . Alright .
C :  Yeah , yeah . So
C :  I think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff
B :  Okay .
A :  So we have five minutes to
B :  Ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . Five minutes .
A :  Ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we
D :  And another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  So , I mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . The lighting in the room changes .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but we are designing just remote control .
A :  You it .
D :  I mean , we have a option in the remote control . If we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote .
B :  Okay .
C :  Oh right so
B :  Okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , or you just want to put the function in ? Go on , draw something .
A :  Yeah . If if you you you can if you want you can use th the .
C :  Please , Norman , draw uh
D :  Oh , I'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel .
B :  Mm .
B :  Where is it ?
A :  Or before the before the the design that says .
D :  The lapel .
B :  Ah , okay .
B :  Where where is it ? Here .
D :  Yeah , that one .
A :  Norman .
D :  Just plug it . Yeah , that's right .
B :  Mm .
A :  Be before before writing you can uh sit and that says what we what we said then after that you can you can use the . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Okay , alright . So so the most functional des mm the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . Right ? We agree on that , right ? Uh , uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons . Uh to choose
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  uh content s or channels . So we have both . The user can choose w which one they want , right ?
C :  Yeah , by content or by channel , it's a good idea .
B :  By content or by channel . Choose by contents or by channels . So
B :  And then what did we say just now ?
B :  Other than this .
C :  And uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents .
A :  Mm .
B :  Okay , so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Challenge .
C :  I think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so
B :  Okay . Content . Okay , so these we have to work it out . So this one of the problem . And uh
C :  I think that's the the things to do and uh to uh
B :  The main thing .
B :  Okay . Alright .
C :  reflect about it and uh
B :  Alright , okay . So we are we'll discuss it we will get some information in the next meeting , so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer ? That's the first aspect . Right .
C :  discuss it in the next meeting .
B :  We will get information and then we'll come back in .
C :  Okay .
B :  .
C :  Thank you everybody .
B :  Yeah , we'll come .
A :  Okay . So maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ?
A :  And we'll discuss the other other aspects .
B :  Alright .
B :  Alright , okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  Thank you , mis
A :  Okay . Well thank you all .
C :  Oops .
C :  That's as far as it goes .
A :  Hi guys uh good morning everybody here .
A :  And uh I want to introduce myself , uh my name is uh Shrida Daseri and uh I'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now .
A :  So I want to introduce first of all uh the names and the colleagues here .
A :  And what you're uh drawing ?
B :  Uh sure my name is Agnes and I'm an user usability user interface designer .
D :  My name is Ed and I do accounting .
A :  Uh how you spell your name uh ?
D :  E_D_ .
A :  E_D_ okay .
D :  Mm .
A :  And ?
C :  Do you also do marketing ?
D :  No .
A :  So only accounting ?
D :  Accounting , yes .
A :  Okay .
A :  And ?
C :  And I'm Christine , and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Industrial designer .
C :  But I'm not really one .
A :  So who is uh marketing , nobody in the market
D :  Marketing is uh , is me .
A :  It's you , okay .
A :  So thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , and uh we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about uh this project and the the project initiation .
A :  First of all I want to ask uh Mister Ed about your uh marketing plan and your product plan and uh
D :  Well I think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product .
D :  We'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this .
A :  Mm-hmm but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or
D :  Uh for the moment not yet .
A :  Oh for the moment not yet , okay , but uh what's what's your uh do you have some project plan , something with you or
D :  Good question .
D :  No , this is like I said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . We'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan , okay , a discussion with uh
D :  Certainly by the next meeting .
A :  By next meeting , okay that will be great .
A :  Okay , so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project ?
C :  What is the goal of the project ?
A :  Uh the goal of the project I think maybe I'll uh hand out to the Ed , okay , so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting .
D :  I'm in the sales I'm supposed to explain them what to do . We have to define exactly what our product is , from uh
A :  Yes , so can you explain uh what exactly the product is ?
D :  From what I had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , is that right ?
A :  Oh I think uh , if I'm not wrong , we're making the remote control .
B :  Um I was wondering
D :  Remote controls , 'cause I had two different things . I had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , and afterward I had a discussion about coffee so we'll start with the remote control for television then .
A :  Yes .
D :  So we're have to design something that is very user friendly .
D :  Something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , because I think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls , and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh th most of them ar I don't know we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , 'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  And uh what abo uh Christine , what about your uh the industrial design plan ?
A :  Are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design ?
C :  Um no , I I have not begun working on the design , and um I uh I actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , I thought we were designing a new monitor . Um the website I went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor , and um I understood that that was the project goal .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So um I'm glad I didn't d do any work um ahead of time because uh I clearly didn't understand the project goal .
C :  Um I just did s see that we were starting a new project together and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , and um that's about uh that's and I I read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ?
C :  Uh for the industrial design ?
A :  Yes .
C :  Um well , I would th think that depends on how much money you give us .
A :  Okay .
A :  That's
C :  Um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models .
A :  Yeah , but uh before we talk about uh the finance , okay , uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also .
C :  Well , you know um , I kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own . So it would really would need to um something like the iPod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , so um d uh you know , I don't care what it does , just so it looks cool .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ?
C :  Well , uh I've got a lot of other projects I'm doing right now um and so I'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go . If they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month . If um if I run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months .
A :  Yeah , but uh I need something in the writing , so like uh what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and uh how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe uh initial budget you're looking ,
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  okay , and uh how is going to the market , okay , so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan ,
A :  okay , when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition , okay , so I need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you .
A :  Okay , and it's po
C :  And when would you like that ?
A :  B as soon as possible .
C :  Uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a is close enough ?
A :  Yes I think uh that would be good , because I need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do , and uh what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , because uh without any uh documentations , I cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money ,
A :  okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason I need uh some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , then we can have the further discussion again .
C :  Uh are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ?
A :  Yes , of course , if you need some help , uh so let me know .
A :  So , who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , so just let me know so I can uh coordinate all the teams .
C :  Okay , I'll get back to you on that .
A :  Yes . Thank you .
A :  Okay .
A :  And uh Ed uh so what's what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ?
D :  Well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into . It should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition , uh th I agree it has to be something it has to be something new , it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , I like this .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Whether it works or not , they have to first say I like this , I like the design , and then it's gotta be simple to use .
A :  Yes , so what I uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the Christine , okay , because you know what she is going to do it , okay , and you know how to sell it .
A :  Okay , because uh she is doing the design , but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So , what I prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the Christine more and uh within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , th
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ?
A :  That that's
A :  Yes , that's you have to decide , okay , so the best thing is you uh both of uh the Christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay .
A :  Then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company .
A :  Okay , of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually .
A :  Okay , so I think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan .
D :  Very good .
A :  Okay , and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know .
A :  Okay , I can coordinate , or maybe uh , you are my coordinator , am I right ?
D :  Very good .
B :  Mm .
A :  Between uh all the coor
B :  Well , no , not exactly . I mean my job from what I understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So I think I'll have to interact with Christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in , but I don't think necessarily that I'm in a coordinating position for it .
A :  Th Christine , yeah .
A :  Which is
A :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , so basically you need to interact with Christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay , then you will
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . Which will also feed into the marketing , because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users . So I think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit .
A :  Yes .
A :  Yes .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um , and then I guess build the plan based on all of that , because I think you need to take all the factors into account .
A :  Yep .
A :  But what I request , okay , keep Ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and Christine meeting , because uh he should know what's happening .
B :  Yeah , of course .
B :  Yeah , we can C_C_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around .
A :  Yes .
A :  Okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , so I need to submit to the management .
B :  Sure .
B :  No problem .
A :  So any questions for uh time being ?
D :  No .
B :  So , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or okay .
A :  Yes .
A :  Okay .
A :  To come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with Ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , so then we can discuss about uh further things .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  So , we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting .
A :  It's okay ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Thanks for coming .
C :  Would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ?

D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I think so .
D :  Yeah , that's a good plan .
A :  and everybody's name and what your function is ? So maybe we start with you ?
B :  Okay . Yeah , my name is Francina . And I'm uh an user interface my role is uh the main responsibility is user interface . And my role is to design uh a television remote control .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
D :  And I'm a marketing person . I wanna figure out how to sell them .
A :  Mm-hmm . And your name is ?
D :  My name is Eileen .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . Uh I'm Jeanne-Oui . Um uh my role is industrial designer and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the technical-functional designs and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design .
A :  Very good . And as you already know I am Betty . I am the project manager for today . So why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um .
A :  Yes y opening , acquaintance , tool training well , the tools are , I think , we already I guess the tool is really our the computer , as far as I can see .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh we get ins each of us will get instructions and we'll take it from there . Project plan , that falls under the same heading pretty much . Um , I don't think we have any great discussion at this point . Um .
D :  No .
A :  Here is what this thing should be . This thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . Uh should be original , trendy , and , of course , user friendly .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So maybe you wanna make some notes of that .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  All right . Here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . Um .
A :  That is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . The same goes for the conceptual design , there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards .
A :  Detailed design , same thing basically .
D :  Mm 'kay so
D :  Three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
D :  Functional , conception
D :  and detailed .
A :  I can't write with this thing .
D :  Maybe we should redesign it .
A :  Yes .
D :  After we've finished the remote control we'll get to that .
A :  Yeah , okay . All right ?
A :  Then , tool training try out the white board , participant can draw their favourite animal . Does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? So that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board .
A :  You wanna go Eileen and
D :  Okay , I'll see what I can do . See if I r
A :  Whether you without hanging yourself .
D :  See if I remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something .
A :  And remember you have to press so it works . Mm-hmm .
D :  So that it will record okay . Um uh um traditional kitty cat .
A :  Fat , a fat cat .
D :  I've a very fat cat . And it likes to sit like that . Okay .
C : 
A :  Okay .
A :  And you're Francine , right ? Would you like s like just to see um how it feels , so that you have a little idea ?
B :  Yes , I'm Francina . Yes , sure .
D :  Am I supposed to wipe off that or okay .
A :  In
A :  No , no . No , that's okay .
B :  No , Okay .
A :  I don't know , we'll get to that later .
D :  Okay .
B :  What should I draw ?
C : 
C :  Snake .
B :  I'm going to draw a snake .
B :  How does it look like ?
A :  Okay . Okay .
D :  Uh , okay .
D :  I hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause I don't like snakes .
A :  Here's the project finance uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . Um selling price is supposed to be twenty five Euro .
A :  Uh profit aim for the company is fifty million Euro , the market range unlimited meaning international
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty Euro .
D :  Mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Profit .
D :  Um is fifty mm .
A :  So these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design to materials , cost , etcetera .
A :  Now , uh the discussion I guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ?
D :  Oops .
C :  Yeah , of course , using remote control . Yeah .
A :  I exp I s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em , right , everyday . And um
B :  Yes .
A :  now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing ye any first ideas ?
A :  Would you like it to be smaller , bigger , have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , you know , things like that ?
C :  Uh .
B :  Yeah , I
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yes , I I feel that all the remote should be very compact . Yeah , those which we get here nowadays it's very long . And um and it should have multi-purpose . Like uh the remote control which we use for T_V_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system .
A :  Small , right . Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Audio player . Oh . Okay .
A :  So it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically .
B :  Yes , exactly
B :  Yes .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yes .
C :  Divides us Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Exactly .
D :  At um twelve fifty Euros per
A :  Well .
D :  Well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that .
C :  Yeah .
D :  We certainly can try to I agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things .
A :  It should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . Now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design .
D :  That's right .
C :  Yeah , of course .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , design should be , yeah it should be different . All the almost all the remotes
A :  Like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . Maybe it should different colours or materials or you know . Um so yeah shapes right , you know , like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know .
C :  Yeah , maybe ten I do yeah , colours and al shapes also . Yeah .
B :  Yes , exactly .
B :  Are different shapes . Yes .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah of course yeah .
D :  Yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . I think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , because I think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . They can't find it .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yes .
A :  That is true , because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . And and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the T_V_ off and they say , where the hell is my my remote control yeah ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So some
A :  Well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . Yeah . Mm-hmm . So if lost
C :  Yeah , some beep or something like that , so that we can go
D :  Uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink .
B :  Or a b
A :  If lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know .
B :  Should ha
C :  Yeah .
B :  A fluorescent signal , yeah .
D :  Mm 'kay .
C :  Yeah , maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . Yeah , yeah .
A :  Exactly , I mean just that's what I'm saying . I'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or
C :  May not be beep .
C :  Beep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light .
D :  And do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ?
A :  Okay , my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ? In in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , I mean , that we can discuss that later , you know .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay so
B :  Yes .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , probably yeah , probably it's a yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah . And uh
D :  So the light sensor would activate the signal .
A :  That's right . You know there would be right you have to have some kind of sensor and I I think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . Uh I know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , but I think they only work to certain degree and
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
D :  But it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it .
C :  Yeah , of course , that didn't
A :  What with
D :  Well , because you're s because you're silly . Because people are silly .
B :  Then , in that case
C :  I i we can't do it .
A :  Oh yeah well , but then those people we can't help everybody .
D :  I mean it could be on well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table um , you know , well maybe we have to move along , okay .
A :  Okay we have uh yeah , we have to move along , but I think we have some good good points to start with here .
C :  Yeah , good point .
A :  Okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . I think you all did you get uh notices on your computer for this ? Okay so well , you got the notice um uh . The working design , I guess that's the function I_D_ uh who is this ? The industrial designer That's you .
C :  Me yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's functional de yeah , exactly , technical .
A :  Okay . So , we looking for a working design when we come back .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design .
A :  Then
A :  And then the technical funct you are the technical function , so so you are the working design . So you have a working design and then a functional design . And the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . That would be your idea . And , of course , price . That it , that it , that the price is a good price . I mean , the price is given , but , that was
C :  Yeah , functional design , and you
B :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  We have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price .
A :  That's right .
A :  That's right .
A :  And , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . I think that's the end of the show . Yeah .
A :  So um we have well , we have a twen two two two three minutes . Um any questions at this point ? Or uh suggestions ?
D :  Mm .
A :  I think basically basically you will get instructions to work with and if you have any questions uh , uh I guess , you can uh
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , I think I have enough to think about 'til our next meeting . How about you people ? Really ? Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , even I have . Yeah , even I have , I think , yeah .
B :  Yes .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , so let's see .
D :  Alright , well uh
A :  Then uh we see you in about thirty minutes . And see what we can come up with .
B :  Yes .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Okay , very good .
B :  Okay . Yes .
A :  Okay ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Right .
B :  Um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . Um and um this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . Um so first of all , just to kind of make sure that we all know each other , I'm Laura and I'm the project manager . Do you want to introduce yourself again ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Great .
A :  Hi , I'm David and I'm supposed to be an industrial designer .
B :  Okay .
D :  And I'm Andrew and I'm uh our marketing
C :  Um I'm Craig and I'm User Interface .
D :  expert .
B :  Great . Okay . Um so we're designing a new remote control and um Oh I have to record who's here actually . So that's David , Andrew and Craig , isn't it ?
B :  And you all arrived on time .
B :  Um yeah so des uh design a new remote control . Um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . Um so that's kind of our our brief , as it were . Um and so there are three different stages to the design . Um I'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails . What did you get ?
A :  Um , I just got the project announcement about what the project is . Designing a remote control . That's about it , didn't get anything else . Did you get the same thing ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Yeah , that's that's it .
B :  Is that what everybody got ? Okay . Um . So we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . And repeat that process three times . Um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . Um . So uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . So who would like to go first ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I will go . That's fine .
B :  Very good .
D :  Alright . So
D : 
D :  This one here , right ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay . Very nice . Alright . My favourite animal
D :  is like
D :  A beagle .
D :  Um charac favourite characteristics of it ? Is that right ? Uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . And , yeah that they have lots of personality and uh be fit and in robust good health . So this is blue . Blue beagle . My family's beagle .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Right . Lovely .
C :  Well , my favourite animal would be a monkey .
C :  Then they're small cute and furry , and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , I'm gonna be up there with them .
B :  Right .
A :  Cool .
A :  There's too much gear .
B :  You can take as long over this as you like , because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . Ok oh we do we do . Don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway .
A :  Okay .
D :  I coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . Boy , let me tell you .
B :  Ach why not We might have to get you up again then .
B :  I don't know what mine is . I'm gonna have to think on the spot now .
D :  Impressionist .
A :  Can't draw .
B :  Is that a whale ?
A :  Um .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Um , well anyway , I don't know , it's just the first animal I can think off the top of my head . Um . Yes . Big reason is 'cause I'm allergic to most animals . Allergic to animal fur , so um fish was a natural choice .
B :  Ah .
A :  Um , yeah , and I kind of like whales . They come in and go eat everything in sight .
D :  Alright .
A :  And they're quite harmless and mild and interesting .
D :  Mm .
B :  Okay . God , I still don't know what I'm gonna write about . Um .
D :  Superb sketch , by the way .
A :  Tail's a bit big , I think .
B :  I was gonna choose a dog as well . But I'll just draw a different kind of dog . M my favourite animal is my own dog at home . Um
D :  Yep .
B :  That doesn't really look like him , actually .
B :  He looks more like a pig , actually .
B :  Ah well .
D :  I see a dog in there . Yep .
B :  Do you ? Oh that's very good of you .
D :  Now I see a rooster .
B :  Uh .
D :  What kind is it ?
B :  Um he's a mixture of uh various things . Um and what do I like about him , um That's just to suggest that his tail wags . Um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , and very kind of affectionate and um
B :  uh and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space . Um
B :  and uh And he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well , which is quite amusing , so
D :  Is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ?
B :  It is . I think it is . He only does it after he's had his dinner and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room .
D :  Hmm .
A :  It's an after dinner dog then .
B :  Yeah , so uh
D :  Probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned .
B :  Yeah , maybe .
B :  Maybe . Right , um where did you find this ? Just down here ? Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Um what are we doing next ? Uh um .
B :  Okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . Um
B :  so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five Euro , um and we're aiming to make fifty million Euro . Um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . And uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty Euros , so fifty percent of the selling price .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Um , can we just go over that again ?
B :  Sure .
D :  Uh , so bas at twel Alright , yeah . Okay .
D :  So cost like production cost is twelve fifty , but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ? Like on the shelf .
B :  All together .
B :  Um I dunno . I imagine That's a good question .
D :  Our sale our sale anyway . Yeah , okay okay .
B :  I imagine it probably is our sale actually because it's probably up to the
B :  the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . Um .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Alright .
B :  But I I don't know , I mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ?
D :  Yes .
B :  Think it will ? Um .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Well right away I'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with D_V_D_ players , if there are zones . Um f frequencies or something um as well as uh characters , um different uh keypad styles and s symbols .
B :  Oh yeah , regions and stuff , yeah . Yeah . Okay .
B :  Yeah . Well for a remote control , do you think that will be I suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Um .
D :  I don't know .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It does make sense from maybe the design point of view 'cause you have more complicated characters like European languages , then you need more buttons .
B :  Yeah , yeah . Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So , possibly .
D :  Yeah . And then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . I'm thinking
D :  the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so
B :  What , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? Like how much money people have to spend on things like ?
D :  Just a chara just a characteristic of the
D :  Just
D :  Or just like , basic product podi positioning , the twenty five Euro remote control might be a big hit in London , might not be such a big hit in Greece , who knows , something like that , yeah .
B :  Aye , I see what you mean , yeah .
B :  Marketing . Good marketing thoughts . Oh gosh , I should be writing all this down . Um .
D :  Yep .
D :  Right away I'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here , thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , something other than just standard . Um
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  so I'm wondering right away , is selling twenty five Euros , is that sort of the thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or
B :  Yeah , yeah . Like how much does , you know , a remote control cost .
D :  Uh-huh .
B :  Well twenty five Euro , I mean that's um
B :  that's about like eighteen pounds or something , isn't it ? Or no , is it as much as that ? Sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yep .
D :  Yeah , I'd say so , yeah .
B :  Um , I dunno , I've never bought a remote control , so I don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . Um .
D :  No .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  But yeah , I suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um right , okay .
B :  Let me just scoot on ahead here . Okay . Um well d Does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ?
D :  Do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other
B :  No , actually . That would be useful , though , wouldn't it , if you knew like what your money would get you now .
D :  other
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l as you point out , I just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . It's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something . It just comes along .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Oh .
B :  Five minutes to end of meeting . Oh , okay . We're a bit behind .
D :  Do you know what I mean ? Like so sort of like how do you I I mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . Or another way is maybe people who have T_V_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I know um
D :  But
C :  My parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . So um for them it was just how many devices control .
D :  Right . Right . Okay so
D :  Right , so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses
B :  Yeah .
B :  Right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , do your your satellite and your regular telly and your V_C_R_ and everything ?
D :  I think so . Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well like um , maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . They're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , M_P_ three players , telephones ,
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  everything , agenda . So , like , I wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , such as the lighting in your house , or um
B :  Yeah .
B :  Or even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . Like you might put in there oh I want to watch such and such and look a Oh that's a good idea . So extra functionalities .
D :  Yeah , yeah . An
D :  Yeah . Like , p personally for me , at home I've I've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my D_V_D_ player and my C_D_ player . So they w all work actually function together but I have different remote controls for each of them . So it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  you know , the sound and everything it's just one system . But each one's got its own little
B :  Hmm .
D :  part .
B :  Um okay , uh I'd wel we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . Um I'll just check we've nothing else . Okay . Um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ?
A :  And you keep losing them .
B :  You keep losing them . Okay .
D :  Mm .
A :  Finding them is really a pain , you know . I mean it's usually quite small , or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch or it's kicked under the table .
D :  Mm . Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . W You get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . There I mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  You know .
D :  That's just really good id
D :  Yep .
D :  Uh , sure . I remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . Actually had a cable between it and the T_V_ and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something . And um , you know , when I think about what they are now , it's better , but actually it's still kind of , I dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . Maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . S
B :  Dunno . Okay maybe .
B :  My goodness .
B :  Still feels quite primitive .
B :  Maybe like a touch screen or something ?
D :  Something like that , yeah . Or whatever would be technologically reasonable .
B :  Okay .
B :  Uh-huh , okay . Well I guess that's up to our industrial designer .
D :  'Cause it could b it could it could be that f it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , but that just the appeal of of not having You know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know . Um , nicer materials and might be
B :  It looks better .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  be worth exploring anyway .
C :  Uh .
B :  Right , well um so just to wrap up , the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . So that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . Um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it so y you know what you're doing there . Um for user interface , technical functions , I guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , what it'll actually do . Um and uh marketing executive ,
A :  Yep .
B :  you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , I guess .
D :  Okay .
B :  Um .
B :  Yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , I guess .
B :  And uh
B :  and that's the end of the meeting .
B :  So I got that little message a lot sooner than I thought I would , so
D :  Um .
D :  Before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same page here , um , do we We were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something , right ? Well ,
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Uh-huh , yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? Or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? I I don't know .
B :  Okay , well just very quickly 'cause this we're supposed to finish now . Um I guess that's up to us , I mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , so um , you know
D :  Yep . Yeah , sure .
D :  Okay .
A :  I think one factor would be production cost .
D :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Because there's a cap there , so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . Um .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  I think that that's the main factor .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Right , okay , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . Um .
D :  Okay .
D :  Alright .
B :  So , uh
B :  thank you all for coming .
A :  Cool .
B :  Okay , well I think we're ready to begin . Right , my name's Adam Duguid , we're here because of real reaction , um , we have in the group
C :  Oh , Ebenezer Ademesoye . Would you like me to spell that ?
B :  Um , yeah , go for it mate .
C :  Um , N_E_Z_
B :  N_ E_ Z_ . Ebenezer . And your role is ?
C :  E_R_ .
C :  I'm the Marketing Expert .
B :  You're the Marketing Expert , okay .
B :  Next we have ?
D :  Tarik Rahman . T_A_R_I_K_ .
B :  T_ R_ I_ K_ . And your role in this is ?
D :  Industrial Designer .
B :  Industrial Designer .
B :  And , lastly we have ?
A :  Uh , Dave Cochrane .
B :  And you're going to be the User Interface , is it ? Designer . Okay .
A :  User Interface Defin Designer , yes .
B :  Right . This is the agenda for today's meeting . As you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . Um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . So , the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , as you probably all know . The very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . Course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , but uh personally I think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . Um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart .
B :  This is how today seems to be going to work . We're gonna have the three kay phases , as you've probably already been told , the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . Um
B :  First one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . Second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . Of course , you've all got the similar emails , I believe , right .
B :  What can I say ? Ebenezer , you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal ?
C :  Sure .
C :  Whiteboard . 'Kay .
C :  S okay . I will make this quick , since we don't have much time .
C :  Um .
C :  'Kay , so it's not the best picture in the world .
C :  Here we have an elephant .
C :  First point , begins with an E_ , same like Ebenezer . Also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself , and I can't remember back when I used to live back in Nigeria , but I think I used to have a pet elephant .
C :  So elephants are big , strong and gentle , and they have great memories , and they begin with the letter E_ , just like Ebenezer .
B :  Brilliantly done . Thank you . Tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ?
C :  Thank you .
D :  .
C :  Oh . Oh oh I think you ga
B :  Oh , um , you can clip them to your belt .
D :  Do we take them off ? Oh right , okay .
B :  You should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well .
C :  The little
C :  The the
D :  Ah-ha .
C :  Oh that's good , we can clip them on . Okay . Yeah , there was this microphone as well that you
D :  Now where do I put the
C :  Just um somewhere
B :  Yep , the , it's just across there , that's it .
B :  Yep .
D :  Is this supposed to be clipped as well ?
C :  I think so .
B :  Yeah . It'll follow you if you
C :  Yeah . There you go .
B :  You can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , I wouldn't worry too much . Should have good range .
D :  Uh , destroying your elephant here .
D :  Uh , here we have a tiger . Uh
D :  I've always loved tigers . They're just they're big , they're biggest cats , uh I did a project on cats in the wild when I was a kid and uh it was my favourite cat , just 'cause it was looks the best , the stripes , orange . My dad used to talk about he's from Bangladesh so he used to tell me all about them when he was when I was a kid . And uh they're just the most feared of of uh animals in the wild . So uh that's why I like them . Didn't say an anything about me really but
B :  Excellent , thank you very much . Dave , if you'd like to uh
B :  have a dash .
A :  Um
A :  Um , the monkey , um . The one f uh in fact this is a somewhat oblique reference in fact to uh well my I have a three uh three y year old daughter who h who who who is affectionately known as Miss Monkey . Um , monkeys have attitude . Which I think is a good thing . And I mean fr and from uh from the point of view of sort of the study of human evolution they and other primates are terribly interesting . Um , so I like monkeys . And and th th th th thi thi this one seems to have perhaps more attitude than most .
B :  Cheers .
B :  Hardly what I'd call the best drawing in the world but it'll do for now . Also not quite as feared as your average tiger , but uh cats are one of my favourite animals , they're very independent , they're snotty as hell at the best of times , and uh , what can you say , you got to love those qualities in an animal .
B :  Right . I think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , so , on to it . Project finance . As you can see , twelve point five Euros per unit . That's not a terrible lot as far as I'm aware , and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . If we're aiming for fifty million Euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them .
C :  Oh , that was profiting , that was an amount , so that's the amount made , okay .
B :  Yep . Well , fifty million , and if you're making twelve point five Euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . So I'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls .
B :  Any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ?
A :  Well , one thing I'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen L_C_D_ remotes that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , so you get the sort of you get um you you can redesign the interface to your own needs , you can programme in macros , and you get a much greater degree um um I mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the T_V_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the V_C_R_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . Um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . And therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay , yeah , tha that's true , with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our yeah . But you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion .
A :  Absolutely prohibitive , yeah .
C :  Oh .
A :  Yeah , I mean I wouldn't like to say you g I mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . Some and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros .
B :  Would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the T_V_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of
A :  For instance , um let's say oh oh um , or um you know you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the D_V_D_ player and it turns the T_V_ on and onto the right channel as well , um
B :  Okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . Um
B :  Any takes on this ?
C :  Well um I've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , um when I was younger we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . So perhaps one that was more um
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
C :  specialised for game playing or interactive television . They they've recently brought out this new remote control , for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . Instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , and slide another bar to say what time it ends , you know that's
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah I've heard I've seen the bar-code design before , yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , it's it's taken out the
C :  Y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . I think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot .
C :  Uh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Okay , well we're beginning to run out of time now , so , we've got a couple of ideas , we can we'll have to work fast , um , alright as you can see we've got thirty minutes until the next meeting , so we'll have to try and decide on some of the basic functionality , um , how the user interface might work , that'll be a key aspect especially if the idea of um some kind of macros facility because you have to program it , you have to have a lot of response back , or at least some kind . Um
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And we're gonna maybe n try and have to figure out
C :  What the user wants uh .
B :  what the user wants , yes . Um , right . Has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ?
C :  Okay .
D :  Well when you're talking about gaming and stuff , do you think they should have some sort of
D :  stick on it , rather than buttons ?
C :  Oh . Okay , .
D :  Like uh control pads , you know of games , but or is that a bit ridiculous ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I I don't see why not , almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . Um
D :  Yeah .
B :  and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well .
A :  Mm-hmm . The other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . But of course , uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of
A :  slightly unconventional or attractive uh
A :  sha shape for it overall , .
B :  Okay .
B :  So , small , stylish , and something that's just a little different .
A :  A curve , mm-hmm . Something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway .
B :  Okay . That's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily .
B :  I would I would have hoped so anyway . Um , right .
B :  I'd say we finish this one up , we get started , I'll get in , I'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , and I'll get that out to everybody .
C :  'Kay . So .
B :  Yeah ? Okay .
D :  .
C :  .
B :  Um , as far as I'm aware we leave the microphones here , um unless we get told otherwise , and just take the laptops with us .
A :  Hmm hmm hmm .
B :  Are we we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , that's fine .
B :  Am I supposed to be standing up there ?
D :  So we've got both of these clipped on ?
B :  Okay .
D :  She gonna answer me or not ?
B :  Yeah , I've got
D :  Right , both of them , okay .
B :  Yes .
D :  God .
D :  Jesus , it's gonna fall off .
A :  Okay . Yep , yep .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Hello everybody . Um I'm Sarah , the Project Manager and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . Okay , this is our agenda , um
A :  Tu tu tu tu
A :  Hi , good morning .
B :  we will do some stuff , get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . Um then we'll go do tool training , talk about the project plan , discuss our own ideas and everything um and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , as far as I can understand .
B :  Now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . Um , we want it to be original , something that's uh people haven't thought of , that's not out in the shops , um , trendy , appealing to a wide market , but you know , not a hunk of metal , and user-friendly , grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . Okay , um , first is the functional design , um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , um what effects the product has to have and how it's actually going to do that . Um , conceptual design ,
B :  what we're thinking , how it's gonna go and then the detailed design , how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Okay , right . We're gonna practice with the pens and draw our favourite animal on the white board , I'll go first , and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . So
A :  Oops .
B :  Okay , I'll leave space for everyone else . Um
B :  What's missing ?
B :  We're running out of blue .
B :  Okay . I'm not gonna ask you to guess , I'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger .
A :  Mm .
B :  And I see them as majestic ,
A :  Oh sorry .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  and independent ,
B :  proud .
B :  Now , who would like to go next ? 'Kay .
A :  Yeah , me .
A :  Cat .
A :  Where did this come from ?
B :  Is that your lapel then ? There you go .
A :  Uh , yep . Thank you . Uh , maybe you can guess what I'm trying to make ?
D :  A kind of dog ?
A :  Yep .
A :  It's actually sitting , so it's sitting , it's not standing . Okay , I see it as one thing it's very supportive .
D :  Sorry ?
C :  It's sitting down .
D :  Uh .
A :  It's your best friend and your you can talk to a dog , it can be your best friend , it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . Second it's loyal and third thing it's got intuition . dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person so basically these are the three unique features I think belong to a dog . Thank you .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay , thank you .
C :  Yeah I'll have a go .
A :  Okay .
A :  Sorry .
D :  Please , please leave me a space at the bottom , I'm little , you can get to the top , with standing on a chair .
C :  Thanks .
C :  Alright , okay . Well since you guys have chosen the ones I wanted to do , I'll have to have to go for something a bit random .
A :  Does it look like a dog actually ?
B :  Okay .
C :  And also , my drawing skill isn't that great so , yeah .
B :  Well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um
A :  Mm .
D :  I think it's outstandingly good .
B : 
C :  Okay , now I'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be because that looks like a beak now , so .
C :  Yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile . Well it was it was an at first firstly it was an attempt at a T_ Rex and then it sort of changed into a pelican but it can be a crocodile now actually .
D :  Crocodile ?
B :  Gonna be a bird .
B :  Is it gonna be it's gonna be a bird .
B :  That's lovely .
D :  Beauti that's
C :  Yeah and uh I'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is . Um
C :  uh scary ,
C :  uh strong ,
C :  yeah that's about it I think .
B :  Okay it's fine .
D :  Okay .
D :  Um , I'm very impressed with your artistic skills , mine's are dreadful . Oops this is now coming apart , let me just put the top in .
C :  Uh uh
C :  Wo
D :  I hope that clicks in , I'll just I'll hold it on , okay .
D :  Oops , oh dear , what happened there ?
B :  Technical help .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Hopefully that'll stay on , two-handed version . Okay , uh
C :  Okay .
D :  Again this is off the top of my head , I was gonna do a big cat too , um .
C :  Uh
D :  Oh dear , it doesn't look what like what I want it to be .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Uh .
C :  Uh
D :  It's not a vampire bat honestly .
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  Uh and somewhere there's a body behind . That's my dreadful that's the worst yet , that's it's meant to be an eagle you can tell it's a flying animal could have been a seagull , I never thought of a seagull . An eagle , um again I'm thinking on my feet goodness . I suppose they're all so independent , I'd put that one down again . Da dum um .
C :  Okay , some sort of bird .
B :  A seagu right , not a seagull .
A :  Eagle , okay .
C :  Ah eagle , right okay .
C :  They're good at golf .
D :  Indepen independent , right , did you say they're good at golf ? Are they ? Oh . Oh right , okay , I'm not good at golf . I'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing .
B :  Eagle .
C :  Yeah , no yeah , an eagle .
D :  And uh , birds of prey aren't they , oh dear , intrepid . I'll put that , intrepid .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  There we go , hope that pen's gonna be okay .
B :  That's lovely .
D :  Whoops .
B :  Okay .
B :  That was fun , right . Um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five Euros , which I don't actually know what that is in Pounds , at all . Any ideas ?
C :  It's about mm , mm yeah .
D :  Seventeen .
A :  One point four or something like that . One point four Euro would make a Pound or something like that .
C :  Yeah , yeah , something like that , so that yeah about seventeen , seventeen Pounds , something like that .
A :  Yeah .
B :  D fifteen ? Seventeen . Okay , that's expensive .
D :  Seventeen Pounds .
D :  Should we be making notes of this ? We can just refer to this later can't we ? Yeah , okay .
C :  But
B :  I think so , I think so , I'll be able to um pull it up , or I could put it in the shared folder or something .
D :  Okay .
C :  Havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . So , it'd still be yeah , we had to buy one .
D :  Right .
B :  Really ?
B :  Mm .
D :  so I suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , we d or or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ?
B :  I think
B :  Yeah , um production cost's at twelve fifty , so
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay , pretty huge margin .
B :  half of the selling price is taken up by building it . Um , and profit aim is fifty million Euros , which is uh
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  In our first year ?
B :  Yi yes , um yeah , I presume so . Um
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So then
D :  You've got market range international and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone user-friendly to everyone . Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  No , yeah .
D :  Big target group .
B :  So yes , yes , I don't think we have to I don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , um making that a key point , just that it's going to be in the international market like Australia , America , things like that . Okay .
D :  No .
D :  Mm .
B :  What are your experiences with remote controls ? I mean I've got we got um we had three videos , a T_V_ and a sort of amp thing all set up so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , but that kept losing the signals so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . I think it was quite a cheapie as well , so that might have had something to do with it , but that was quite good , the fact that you could
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that c
D :  Alright .
C :  Yeah uh .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Use all the ones at the same time .
B :  You didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you .
D :  Right .
A :  Okay , you wanna integrate everything into one like
C :  Yeah , 'cause you
D :  Mm-hmm . My experience has only been being given the remote control with the object I buy , not doing any tampering with it and programming , using it to programme T_V_ and uh uh videos and things . But basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , I don't think I could go any further with it than that , so , I suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , the main that's the main stuff anyway , I mean and you don't want to I hate I hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm . And symbols that you don't necessarily understand , symbols you're meant to understand that you don't .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um .
A :  So simplification of symbols you could think of .
B :  When they're when you've got the main things on the front of it and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . 'Cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , it's obvious what you're doing , um .
D :  Oh yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
D :  Actually that just raises a point , I wonder what our design people think , but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , I wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , so you've got a little L_C_D_ display .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Menu , alright .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uh uh
A :  Right , I was thinking on the same lines you , instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an L_C_D_ di display or something like that , like a mobile , yeah and with menus . And if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe .
D :  With menus , yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  What about the older generation ? What about granny and grandads ?
A :  You mean to save it lesser number .
B :  Um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ?
A :  Right .
B :  I don't think they tape things , I don't think they use
C :  Yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so .
D :  Right .
D :  Right .
D :  So that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , and that's another issue how we tackle that .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm , yeah , the age gap .
C :  Yeah , what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out
C :  what everything's doing , 'cause I mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But I don't know how
B :  I don't know , I d I don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a Windows-based running system .
C :  Oh yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I find it really confusing , I kept getting lost in the phone , I di I've not got a new one but uh my friend got a new one and I was trying to do things with it and I just kept getting lost , but
D :  Right .
B :  that's just me .
C :  Yeah , I don't I don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve Euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white L_C_D_ thing anyway , I'd assume .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? Obviously it displays less on the screen , it displays less on the screen but as long as they can read it that's the main thing .
A :  Okay .
B :  Teletext has got that option as well .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Or what about kind of a dual function ? In that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm . The other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm , okay .
B :  I think that's a cost thing , I don't I don't know how much we're gonna know about
A :  It might it might save a b bit of space , it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . But it might have its cost implications .
D :  Yeah ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , no that's important .
D :  Yeah , like smaller .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  And there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? Something that's easily moulded and produced . Sorry I'm treading on your territory guys .
B :  Mm .
A :  Right .
B :  Yeah .
C :  No uh uh
B :  Um , right , okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting , so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . Um
B :  I think that's probably about it and then we'll come back and liaise again and I get to do another fantastic PowerPoint presentation .
C :  Yeah . Just just a quick thing about the um about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable ? The sort of I I had a quick look at the company website and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics , so I think think the whole design thing might be qui I mean you don't you you can still have plastic and it'd look quite good but
B :  Sure .
D :  Ah right .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Sure b y yeah .
D :  But yeah , I mean it doesn't have to be that , you know th that was my main point , we don't have to use metal , I don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , I presume it would . Yeah , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  I would it would probably .
B :  I mean there's Sky remote controls and everything . They're kind of moulded and look a bit different , and the Telewest remote controls are silver plastic , which looks a bit smarter , so yeah I guess that's stuff we can think about . Okay , so let's break it up there .
D :  Right .
D :  Okay .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Okay ? So , see you in half an hour .
C :  Okay .
D :  Do we go back to our room ? Yep ?
B :  I think so , yeah .
A :  Mm , yeah .
C :  Uh , making a profit of fifty million Euros . So , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy .
A :  Alright so twenty five .
D :  Mm 'kay .
A :  So yeah , I've
A :  The only the only remote controls I've used usually come with the television , and they're fairly basic . So uh
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , I was thinking that as well , I think the the only ones that I've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things where they're , yeah . So presumably that might be an idea to
D :  Yeah the universal ones . Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  But but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . For sure .
C :  put into .
B :  Slim .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah . Uh 'cause I mean , what uh twenty five Euros , that's about
C :  I dunno , fifteen Pounds or so ?
D :  Mm-hmm , it's about that .
C :  And that's quite a lot for a remote control .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Mm . Um well my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . As you said they come with the T_V_ so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , so maybe we could think about colour ? Make that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . Um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , so um I thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , you know those things ?
C :  Uh-huh .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  The the keyrings , yeah yeah . Okay , that's cool .
D :  Because we always lose our remote control .
A :  Right .
B :  Uh yeah uh , being as a Marketing Exper Expert I will like to say like before deciding the cost of this remote control or any other things we must see the market potential for this product like what is the competition in the market ? What are the available prices of the other remote controls in the prices ? What speciality other remote controls are having and how complicated it is to use these remote controls as compared to other remote controls available in the market .
C :  Okay .
B :  So before deciding or before finalising this project , we must discuss all these things , like and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their C_D_ player , M_P_ three player like any electronic devices . They really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , so , yes , all this .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  'Kay .
A :  Uh , what do we think a
C :  So , we're looking for
C :  'Kay . We're
A :  What do we think a good size would be for this ?
C :  Sorry , carry on .
A :  'Cause I I know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Then you lose it , yeah . Kind of um , maybe more like a P_D_A_ kind of , just hand held , like , 'cause
C :  Okay .
C :  For for uh remember we're trying to make it for twelve Euros fifty .
D :  Yeah . No , I wasn't , no sorry I wasn't thinking of the screen of like a P_D_A_ but
C :  Okay well right we'll have to um I'll we're k having another meeting in half an hour so um we should all look into a bit
D :  Okay .
C :  uh , oh actually , no , we'll allocate . So you do the looking around at other remote controls . Um , if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , and you could look into um
B :  Yeah .
C :  basically how how it's made I_E_ like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . And obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach .
A :  Right .
C :  Which will probably just usurp what I said so
D :  So you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? Yep .
C :  Shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive .
D :  Okay .
C :  Uh .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And you look at competition and design . Cool . So we have uh
B :  Yep .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Wait for emails ?
B :  Uh .
C :  Um .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Okay , groovy . And no doubt we'll get um
D :  Oh no , . Sorry it's okay .
C :  Sorry . We'll get um warnings for next meetings as well . Okay . I shall I can't imagine these are worth much . Okay .
D :  Okay , cool .
B :  Hmm .
C :  Fashion into electronic . Okay .
D :  .. .
C :  Okay .
C :  So , this is uh first meeting of
C :  this design project . Um and I um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , I don't know if it was sent round to all of you .
D :  Mm , yeah . I didn't receive it yet .
C :  Maybe not . Anyway , this is the the plan for today's meeting is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , um although I'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . Then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more . Um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , um specifically the whiteboard over there . Um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um and discuss come up with some preliminary ideas about it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And then that's it . So we've got twenty five minutes to do that , that's until eleven twenty five .
C :  S so any any questions ? Is i
A :  so sh
A :  .
D :  Not at this point .
C :  not at this point .
C :  So this is our project . What we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . Um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product .
C :  The method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . There's the functional design of the the remote control . We're going the way we'll do that I think is to to work individually initially and then come together for meetings to to work on that .
C :  Um similarly with the conceptual design , we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops and then we'll bring what we've done together .
C :  Um and then the detailed design will come after that . We'll pull it all together .
A :  I'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? Uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as I understand it ?
C :  I think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your
C :  um area of things where you'll be we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control and what what specific things it it has to do but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing .
A :  Right .
A :  How how it will be done .
A :  So whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? Uh I think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ?
C :  Um I think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . Um what I'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , specifically the whiteboard .
A :  Hmm .
C :  So each person in turn , I'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , the pen's just underneath it there and draw your favourite animal and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project .
B :  Why are you looking at me ?
C :  Would you like to go first ?
B :  Do I have a choice ? Okay . Ooh ooh , things falling everywhere . Right , okay .
C :  Oh , yeah , p put them in pockets .
B :  Cool .
C :  You don't have to hurry , we've got plenty of time .
B :  Okay .
B :  So , my name's Cat and I'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey so um
B :  Okay .
C :  It's got no eyes .
B :  Oh , good point .
B :  Ah , the eyes always ruin it . Right . Okay , what do it's eyes like ?
B :  Okay , cool . Um this is a rabbit .
C :  I thought it might be a cat .
D :  Yeah well origi uh at first I thought it was going to be cat .
B :  Yeah , I don't think it's furry enough , so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit .
D :  Yeah now I now I understand now , yeah .
C :  Yeah I can see by the ears .
B :  Okay , right , it's a fluffy rabbit , blue . Rabbits don't come in blue but you know . Um okay and I like it because it's small and it's fluffy .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  And one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink .
D :  Ah .
B :  Okay ?
C :  Excellent , and what's your what's your role within the team ?
A :  Mm .
B :  I am the um I need my notebook , mm ooh top banana . Thank you . Okay , cool , I am the Marketing Expert um so like
B :  I'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design um so yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  'Kay .
C :  And more about yourself , you're from ?
B :  Um I'm from Leicester , um second year . Um what else do you want to know ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I like sports um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning um and uh
C :  But not with rabbits .
B :  not with rabbits , no no . And vets , I like vets as well . And yeah um and I like cocktails , especially pink ones . Okay ? Cool .
A :  Mm .
A :  Cool .
C :  Excellent , to match the rabbit .
D :  Okay . Um so my name is Maarika . Where's the pen ? Okay .
C :  There's a an if you have not enough room there's an eraser there and you can rub it off .
D :  Yeah , well , or I can make it smaller . Uh so um um I'm the Interface Designer in this project and my favourite animal , I m I mean I'm not so sure because I'm not so so very um familiar with all kinds of animals , but I do like dogs . Oh , sorry , maybe I should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but mm hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um .
D : 
A :  That's not bad at all . Yep .
C :  Ah it looks like a dog .
D :  Okay .
B :  Is a bit more impressive than my rabbit . I think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though .
D :  Yeah , maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah . Um yeah and I do like dogs because they are good friends to people and they are loyal .
C :  the other legs are on the other side .
D :  Mm , well that's compared to some other animals like cats . Um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent . Um
C :  .
D :  yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . Um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say . Uh I hope to be loyal to the project and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . I'm from Estonia uh , yep . Um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? Oh , right , my roles , um so um in the different um stages of the design , so at first I will be responsible for um for yeah , designing the technical functions of the um
C :  And where where are you from ?
C :  Estonia .
A :  .
D :  um of the remote control uh then in the in the conceptual design stage I need to um come up with uh interface concept and then in the last um stage I will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design .
A :  .
D :  Okay , that's it .
A :  Thank you .
A :  Okay um I'll do some
A :  I'll rub the features and let the drawing stay .
A :  'Kay um my name is Gaurav .
A :  Um my favourite animal one of my favourite animals is a cow . I've got no idea how to draw a cow .
C :  Good luck .
A :  Uh this is going to be
B :  They're not just like a big round body and then some really skinny legs and then just some horns .
A :  Yeah , that'll do . Okay , so let let me draw the body first .
C :  Mm .
A :  Big , round body , really skinny legs and they've got a long tail and a long face .
C :  It's eating .
A :  And there is some grass there . So this is what I like about cows that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , they do not disturb anybody um they're kind of Buddhist in a way . So yeah , I like cows . Um my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , so I'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um ho how it works and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , what are the various components of it and um finally , I'm not too sure what was the last part . Um the detailed design , I I guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other .
B :  It looks like Eeyore .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Horns , draw some horns .
A :  Um I'm from India . Uh I'm doing my P_H_D_ in Psycholinguistics , I sit at the Department of Psychology . Yeah .
A :  Thank you .
C :  Excellent .
D :  Thanks .
C :  Right , now now it's my turn obviously .
C :  Okay , here's a space .
A :  That doesn't look like a cow , does it ?
D :  It looks very very cute .
C :  Yeah , I like the cow . I'm Jen .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um I like dogs too , but I can't do that already because I can't draw a dog as well as you can . I like
C :  Mm .
B :  Is that a lizard ?
A :  No way .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Wow .
C :  It's a gecko .
D :  Ah , a gecko , okay . Is a ar are they also like lizards or are they yeah , they are mm-hmm .
A :  Ah okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Is there a difference ?
C :  They're
C :  Yeah , they're l it's a kind of lizard . And I I like geckos because they remind me of warm places and , and where I was living in Cambodia they used to live in my house and they were on the ceiling and they would make little gecko noises in the evening .
D :  Ah .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Mm-hmm . I hope you don't like snakes , do you ?
C :  I don't like snakes . I come from Australia and we have nasty snakes . That's where I'm from , Australia . I'm from Melbourne and I'm your Project Manager for today and my role is basically to keep things going and make sure that you all work together
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product .
D :  Wonderful .
C :  Okay .
A :  Thank you .
C :  So , let's see what's next in the PowerPoint presentation .
C :  So , I've just thought yeah I've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as there we go . Okay , so this is the um overall budget for our
B :  If you right click on it you can
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  project . We've got um we're planning to sell these remote controls for let's make that go away , that means we've got five minutes . Um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five Euros each .
C :  Um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million Euros .
C :  And that's selling them on the international market , not just in the U_K_ .
C :  Um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half Euro so that we can reach that
C :  profit target .
C :  So that's something to keep in mind while you're designing .
C :  Okay .
C :  Hmm .
C :  This is let me just skip ahead to see that's the last thing , okay . We've only got a couple of minutes . Does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ?
D :  Yep . I'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original so um I think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this .
C :  Something something new .
B :  Yeah , I was looking at the website , and the other things that they've made and I like put down some like inspirational words like that I got from looking at the pictures . So the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? So I'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh-huh .
A :  Alright .
B :  You know , so something heading towards that , so it's not overly I mean I don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , so I figure how many do you need , you know ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  So perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or
B :  Something that's a little less crowded than this , like I mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your T_V_ , right ? But what do most people do ? They turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . Sometimes they play a movie .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  There is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , so
B :  there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , maybe to do
C :  So , no . It could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that .
A :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And then use the
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . Hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Excellent .
B :  'Cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , the train on the website and I dunno if you can put it up on the thing um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , but it looks really pretty too .
C :  Oh I haven't had a look yet , yep .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Great . Any other immediate thoughts before we
A :  Mm .
C :  move along ?
A :  Uh we can aim for I mean we can think about all these little things , but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , although I don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah but uh I mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems with l learning , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  A big learning curve , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . So , i it should kind of fit in as well , and the stereotype of a yeah .
C :  It's like those fancy websites
D :  Hm-hmm .
C :  that you can't access because you have no idea how to get in , but the designers thought they were great .
C :  Okay , so we need to wrap it up now , so that we can go away and get on with some of this . Um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , so
C :  you're you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , but im basically you're looking at the working design ,
A :  Alright .
C :  you're looking at the technical functions design ,
C :  and for you it's the user requirements specification , like you said at the start .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay ?
D :  Okay . Thank you .
C :  Thanks for that .
C :  Uh I'll see you in half an hour .
A :  .
D :  See you .
C :  Carry the laptops back again . Do we need to unplug things ? Probably .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Ooh .
B :  So we're 'kay ? On the or
B :  No . I dunno where to put it 'cause the
B :  Okay . Could you s take it off ? .
D :  Is that alright ?
D :  or
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Keeps coming off . 'S fiddly .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Right .
A :  How do we sta wa how do we start ?
A :  Does anybody know ?
D :  Oh , another one .
A :  So that's this
A :  Oh okay , right .
B :  Are we free to take notes uh
B :  Okay .
A :  Uh .
A :  .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Okay , just hang on a second everybody . I haven't actually looked at this yet .
D :  Ah .
A :  um
D :  Very nice .
A :  I haven't looked at it , but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens .
A :  If you're all ready .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So is the agenda ? Opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing .
A :  Project aim is a new remote control . It's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly . Project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , individual work and a meeting .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Tool training .
A :  Try out the whiteboard , every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um .
A :  Uh Miss Industrial Designer , would you like to go first ?
B :  Okay .
B :  So are we supposed to bring the little things for the
A :  Yeah , why don't you just c , I think just clip on clip do you have a belt ?
D :  Clip .
B :  Mm .
A :  Or put 'em in your pocket , yeah .
B :  Yeah . okay . So my favourite animal
A :  Yeah , what's your favourite animal ?
B :  'Kay um
D :  Ah .
A :  Is it rude ?
D :  It's an elephant .
A :  That's a very good elephant .
C :  The back end of an elephant .
D :  Oh my gosh , I'm never gonna be able to draw that well .
A :  'Kay , and you want to write up on there , it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal .
B :  Um okay , it's big , it's got a great memory .
D :  Does it ? Oh .
B :  Supposed to have a great memory , we say an elephant never forgets . And uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me . Nice animal .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Okay . Wonderful , well done . Do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off ?
B :  Okay .
A :  And Mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ?
C :  Aesthetic yep , sure .
D :  I have no idea what my favourite animal is .
C :  'Kay , my favourite animal , uh let's see .
D :  Oh .
D :  It's
C :  Dunno if any of you have seen Napoleon Dynamite before . It's a liger , a combination of a lion and tiger . Have you not seen Napoleon Dynamite ? Oh it's a hilarious movie . You have to see it . And
D :  A what ?
A :  No .
D :  Alright .
D :  How .
A :  No .
D :  No .
B :  No .
C :  and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much
C :  the awesomest
C :  animal .
C :  But you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it .
A :  Okay , well done .
D :  Great .
D :  Me ?
A :  Yeah . Miss mar Miss Marketing ?
D :  Okay .
D :  Not quite sure how this is gonna work .
C :  There go .
D :  Cool . Uh well I'll try my best to draw .
D :  Can I just draw the face ?
A :  Um yeah , I think you can just draw the face , but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks .
D :  Ooh .
D :  It's a cat . Which also has what ? A big fat body and
A :  That's a very pr pretty cat .
D :  big and a long tail .
A :  Okay , do y do you wanna do some write you wanna just write some words about it ?
D :  Why ? Because um cuddly .
D :  And usually cats are very friendly . Usually .
D :  And they're healing as well . They heal . And they can feel when a human's got problems so
A :  Wow , so they're kinda spiritual .
D :  So , that's why I like cats .
A :  Well done .
D :  There we are , that's me .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
A :  Um , I don't actually have a favourite animal , but for the for th for this meeting I'll s draw a little
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh .
A :  I honestly can't draw for toffee . Uh .
B :  Really ? Oh that's a
A :  Yeah .
A :  no no uh
C :  A prairie dog ? Oh a squirrel ?
A :  That's exactly what it is . Uh not a very good one
B :  Not bad I would say .
C :  Yeah , that's pretty good .
A :  Okay , well , you got it's a s
A :  It's a squirrel , and I like them , because they're cute
A :  and stupid .
B :  Very good .
D :  Ah .
C :  Alright .
A :  Right . Okay , so , I guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working .
A :  Mm . Let's move on to the next page . Okay , project finance , selling price twenty five Euros , profit aim fifty million Euros .
D :  Market range internationally sold .
A :  Yeah . Production cost , ah right it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make .
D :  Ah right okay .
A :  experience with with remote control , so talk about who who's used what . Any ideas ?
A :  Stuff like that .
A :  Next meeting starts in thirty minutes .
A :  At quarter to twelve .
C :  So I think before we close uh , we are expected I mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our
C :  what our ideas where . I mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . Uh
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I think we're I mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for
A :  Oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or oh okay . I thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I think this is just the preliminary , get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been and and what we would
C :  roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe .
A :  Okay . Right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ?
A :  Pretty much everybody .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I think we've all got
D :  Uh .
A :  Um .
B :  Is this a T_V_ one we are supposed to make ?
D :  Yeah . Yeah it's a T_V_ remote control .
B :  Okay .
D :  Well .
A :  'Kay um .
D :  A new remote control for T_V_ .
D :  What would I like ? Um .
A :  W what
A :  You want it big do you want it small .
D :  Medium .
A :  Are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas , I mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of T_V_ and if you have whatever associated with T_V_ the D_V_D_ player , or something like that , but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something .
A :  Video and ts hi-fi and stuff .
A :  Maybe you yeah now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  'Cause I I I mean I was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an L_C_D_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices ,
D :  Mm .
A :  but that would p that would probably be quite expensive .
B :  But how do we know how much uh , I mean , how much do we have per how much ? Twelve fifty .
D :  Twelve fifty .
C :  It g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit .
D :  Each .
A :  Per unit , yeah .
C :  Cost .
B :  So do we have to be realistic within the budget or
B :  Close pr I don't know how much it would cost . Yeah .
A :  Well at the moment we could , wa I mean we 'cause we this is what we th what we're doing at the moment is just saying what what we'd like , and then after we after we've found out what we can like , some different ideas , we can then go and do the research to find out if these any of these ideas are feasible or not . So would be nice to have something that that controls lots of different things .
D :  Guess
B :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
D :  Couldn't we have like one that comes out ?
D :  Like so you have one in like mm it doesn't have to be really thick . I mean remote controls can be thin bits . And then you have one for your D_V_D_ and you sort of slide it out , and then you have another one , you slide it out . have slides . And then it all comes compact
B :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Okay , that's .
D :  into one . So it's not you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically .
A :  Th that's an idea .
D :  So you just flip them out .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ access and stuff , and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . I can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated .
A :  Okay .
A :  One side for kids , one side for adults .
C :  I'm not sure if that's like
B :  Yeah . Or grandma as well , you know it's like what is the mute button .
C :  I'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it .
B :  No , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but
C :  Oh .
C :  Oh okay .
A :  Like it or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  That would be cool . I was thinking that like a flip .
A :  F flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um , oh we've got five minutes left .
B :  Start breaking up .
D :  Okay . Um .
A :  But okay .
A :  Well we've got a k we've got a few ideas there .
C :  Yeah , we should uh I guess by the end of this meeting we should have at least a a rough conception you know stage one was technical functions design , what effect the apparatus should have . Okay . Um so I mean we still have time in our next meeting to come up with the actual concept for the user interface , but the the functions that we're sure that we want are that it can control the T_V_ , but also devices connected to the to the T_V_ , I mean , be able to operate
D :  .
A :  Yeah .
C :  D_V_D_ players , things like that .
A :  I have got I think we should also have a back-up plan of I 'cause I I I just think that it might be expensive to make something that I mean we don't , we haven't been told it has to be something that will control everything . We should have a back-up plan of just a really good television remote control , that just that is just for a T_V_ , but it's just a really good , nice one .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Right .
A :  What do you reckon ?
C :  Yeah , I mean .
A :  See 'cause , I'm just thinking bearing in mind th we've gotta we have to have something that's cheap to make .
C :  Yeah , that's true , maybe we should just concentrate on having a a good T_V_ remote , and have it be um
A :  I think we'll be able to come up with ideas and stuff a lot quicker .
C :  have it be like ergonomic so it's comfortable to use , uh simple to use , and looks decent and
A :  Yeah .
A :  May w you know , maybe even
D :  But what'll make it what'll make it interesting for people to buy though ? I mean if it's if it's just like
A :  Or maybe even so something that's for disabled people or so people that uh b don't see very well or big buttons for touchy buttons for
C :  Sorta find a niche for our remote , like market it to a certain kind of p kind of people ,
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  certain certain demographic
A :  Or just one that looks really fucking cool .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , no I think you're right .
B :  Could be really light or , I dunno , something special .
C :  Yeah , rathe rather than focus on
A :  Otherwise we'll be we'll be here all day talking about do this let's do that n I think we sh I think we should
C :  Y
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , 'cause at the end of the day if it says just T_V_ remote , doesn't say com combination with all all the r
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I mean obviously everyone we're uh you know uh sounds like we're all a bit sort of gadget heads and we like things that do everything at once , but you know , that's
C :  Remotes spinning out from other remotes and having little nested remotes inside .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , that's right . Yeah . I mean I'd like one that makes tea as well , but that's not gonna happen .
D :  I think a flip up thing , 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this well I did anyway , like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , and you'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone's the television switched on or something . So maybe something that like
D :  does have a lid or closes , so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something .
A :  Okay , like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it . So make it Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it's gotta be sellable . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's true what you were saying , I mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  And even for kids as well . It's um it's safer for them , I guess . Like they don't flick onto
D :  channels and all that sl flick onto .
A :  No porn channel for children . Okay . Um alright , so we've got some ideas , we've got um
B :  Okay .
C :  I guess that's good good for now .
A :  Let's move on .
D :  Mm .
A :  Oops , let's close that . Next meeting , uh okay .
D :  W What does I_D_V_I_D_N_M_E_ stand for ?
A :  Industrial Designer um which is
D :  Ah ri okay . these are requirement specification .
B :  That's
A :  Um .
D :  And I'm marketing .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , there you go . So
A :  User Interface Designer , that's that's that's you , so you gotta you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . Um .
C :  That's me . Okay .
C :  Right . Right .
A :  Industrial Designer , you are the one , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , I guess so , um
A :  whether it's what goes into the box , somehow .
B :  Mm . Har how it works an
A :  And in marketing
D :  These are requirement specification .
A :  User requirements specifications .
D :  So what the user requires
A :  Yeah , what
B :  Do you think our two kind of overlap , because
D :  in a remote .
A :  Right , okay , yeah .
C :  Yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap .
D :  I guess that's what it says .
A :  You two you two are gonna be just , I think , you just double up , you know , you working together .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  You're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research , see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that .
D :  Mm .
A :  Oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . Okay .
A :  Okay everyone , well done . Good meeting .
C :  Alright , see you in thirty minutes .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So , do we take these off ?
B :  I don't
D :  Hmm .
A :  Okay . Good morning everybody . Um I'm glad you could all come . I'm really excited to start this team . Um I'm just gonna have a little PowerPoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . My name is Rose Lindgren . I I'll be the Project Manager .
A :  Um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening and then I'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . And then we'll move into the project plan , do a little discussion and close , since we only have twenty five minutes .
A :  First of all our project aim . Um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . Um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts . First the functional design which will be uh first we'll do individual work , come into a meeting , the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . So that we'll each be doing our own ideas and then coming together and um collaborating .
A :  Okay , we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . So um , what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with Amina . Um Alima , sorry , Alima . Um we're gonna do a little tool training , so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . Um introduce yourself , um say one thing about yourself and then draw your favourite animal and tell us about it .
B :  Alima .
B :  Okay . Um I don't know which one of these I have to bring with me .
A :  Probably both .
B :  Right , so , I'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . I have no drawing skills whatsoever . But uh let's see , introduce myself . My name is Alima Bucciantini . Um I'm from the state of Maine in the US . I'm doing nationalism studies ,
B :  blah , blah , blah , and I have no artistic talents .
A :  How do you spell your name ?
B :  A_ L_ I_ M_ A_ .
A :  Thanks .
B :  Oh , and I guess I'm the Industrial Designer on this project . So let's see if I can get um here . I will draw a little turtle for you all . Not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , but just that I think they're drawable .
B :  And you have the pretty little shell going on .
B :  Some little eyes . Happy .
B :  There you go . That's a turtle .
D :  Yes .
A :  So what are your favourite characteristics ?
B :  Um . I I like the whole having a shell thing . It's quite cool carry your home around where you go , um quite decorative little animals , they can swim , they can , they're very adaptable , they carry everything they need with them , um and they're easy to draw .
A :  Mm .
A :  Excellent . Shall we just go around the table ?
C :  Uh Okay . Well , my name is Iain uh
A :  Mm .
C :  and I'm the User Interface Designer for the project . Um .
C :  I'll try and draw my favourite animal .
B :  No , you can erase the turtle , it's alright .
C :  I'll I should leave that one on there shouldn't I before I callously rub it off .
A :  Might be nice to have them all up there at same time .
C :  Um I'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um .
C :  Is that at least identifiable ?
B :  Snake . Well , snake ? It's w
D :  Well .
C :  It's a whale , yes . Thanks . Um and , yeah , the reason I like whales is 'cause uh they're well , first of all they're quite intelligent um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , like we don't really know much about them or or understand how they work , how they form groups . And I just find them interesting animals .
D :  Oh my god , it's better than what I'm gonna be able to do .
D :  Take my contraptions with me .
D :  Alright , I'm Jessy . I'm from around D_C_ ish sort of in the U_S_ .
D :  And we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , animal .
D :  Don't really know how to draw this .
D :  Just where can I
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
D :  Maybe if I do the water , but how ?
D :  Sort of give an idea . I have no idea how one would explain this .
D :  Mm maybe with some whiskers .
D :  Briefly , it's supposed to be a seal .
D :  You can imagine it in the water . I like them , because they are like playful and silly sort of have a good time .
D :  Not gonna try and pretend like I can get any better than that .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Mm 'kay ? I'm Rose and I'm Project Manager , from California .
A :  Um .
A :  Hmm .
A :  S
B :  Oh , a cat .
D :  It's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Um it's actually a coyote . Let's see . Let's see , let's give it a little bit of a snout , I don't know , some teeth .
B :  Right .
D :  That's impressive .
B :  That's
A :  Yeah .
B :  That's pretty impressive .
C :  Cool .
A :  Oh dear . Yes . I live um I live right across the street from an open space in California . We have coyotes howl all the time . So I really enjoy their their singing , you they're really beautiful animals . Mm .
A :  Okay um , moving on to
A :  slightly more serious stuff . We're gonna talk about project finances . Um we have a couple we'd like to sell it for about twenty five Euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million Euro um from our sales and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of Internet , like it's an international market range , we don't have to worry about specifics .
A :  Um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty Euro . So we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for .
A :  Okay um , just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , I could I'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , so
D :  Um I hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the T_V_ like you have to do one for the power of the T_V_ and then like another one to get the actual screen on and something else to get it all going , I don't know . Now they keep combining all different remotes together , and I don't know if I necessarily like that 'cause I feel like you end up with multimedia overload . I just wanna watch the T_V_ um .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Always gets lost . Some sort of like
D :  device to help you find it .
C :  I've used , I've used remote controls , for things like T_V_ and the C_D_ player and video recorder and
C :  I I guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . You don't have to get up and walk across the room to change a channel . So especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . Um .
A :  Mm .
C :  I find them they can be a bit annoying , especially , like you know if I'm watching T_V_ I have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the T_V_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . Um .
C :  And also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , they've got too many buttons on them uh too too sort of too sort of complicated when all I really wanna do is switch on and off , change the channel , change the volume .
B :  Yeah um .
B :  I agree with having too many remotes around . My dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , and I don't know how to work half of them um .
B :  What's important for me , I guess , is that it's easy to use and that there's not too many buttons , they are not too small , you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing .
B :  And one thing I particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . Um , I think there is a way around that , but I know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the T_V_ itself , and I think that's if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So
D :  What about like batteries and things like that , like are there some remotes that don don't require
D :  like batteries or do all remotes require batteries ?
A :  Um I would imagine all of them , but we could but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery um that would last a lot longer than like double A_s . Um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um M_P_ three players now and that kind of thing . Um .
B :  I know .
B :  Yeah , something that doesn't
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Um . Okay , it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . So um like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . So how do we work with that ?
B :  Yeah . Could we get something that
C :  Mm .
B :  just has
B :  No doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder or program s other things that I'm not very coherent about , but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  channel changing .
D :  And maybe that spatially divides it , so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the T_V_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , I dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the T_V_ stuff was here , then all the V_C_R_ stuff was here , all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , 'cause then you like , I don't even know what I'm turning on .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  N that way
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . Because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the T_V_s no longer have as well . So like you have to have them somewhere , 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . Um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote .
B :  Um .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
C :  Can I ask , are we designing a remote control for a television only um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television
A :  Good question .
C :  would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ?
A :  I don't know that yet .
C :  Um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ?
B :  Mm .
A :  It's a good question . Um .
A :  I'll look into that .
D :  Mm-hmm hmm .
A :  If I can .
D :  I think it's just T_V_ , I mean , if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say .
B :  Mm yeah .
D :  You know , things might be more advanced than that .
A :  Mm .
C :  So we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control .
C :  Well , I mean I suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well I I don't know if that works technologically or not .
B :  Yes . I guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . If it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler , 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  It's an idea with the buttons being really .
B :  Large . If you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . 'Kay sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . Mind if we move on ? Ps mm okay . Um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . I believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um ,
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  'Kay .
B :  Hmm .
A :  but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . Um the industrial design , Alima will be doing um the working design . Um the User Interface Designer , that's for . Technical functions , I guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . Um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , um I guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm 'kay um . And you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . I realised in this past one we we didn't have much , we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . Um so very exited to see all your animals and how what wonderful um artists we all are um .
A :  Any questions ?
C :  What we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? Do we know that ?
A :  I haven't gotten an agenda yet , um I'll put that together . I'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions and then we'll come back together . So I'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time
C :  Right .
C :  Yep .
B :  'Kay .
C :  Yep .
B :  I'm sure we'll be busy .
A :  Mm 'kay um I'll type up mi minutes and probably email those out to all of you . Um just including all the things that we talked about . Um .
C :  Okay .
C :  Can you e-mail your slides as well ? Is that possible ?
A :  Yes , I yes , I think I can . Mm-hmm . I'll just attach it to an email . And you're you're number two , three , four ? Is that correct ? Okay .
C :  Cool .
B :  I'm two .
D :  I'm four .
B :  Alright .
A :  Excellent . It was lovely meeting you all .
A :  Just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Let me see if I can do that right now .
D :  Are you sure I got it all head's kinda small . Okay .
C :  How're we placed in terms of the alright .
D :  We're okay ?
B :  Guess I should probably try to sit up straight .
A :  Like that ? Okay , cool .
D :  We're good ?
B :  Oh , I think mine's fallen off .
C :  It fell
C :  That's why .
D :  I guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . Mm . Uh okay .
C :  Ah .
A :  Okay ?
A :  Right , so I'm just gonna start this PowerPoint real quick . Yeah , PowerPoint . Yeah , well , you know , .
B :  Wow .
D :  Very official .
A :  Yeah I kinda like this I'm kinda getting into it . Right . Um . So just to kick off the meeting basically um so we're working now for a real reaction , this is uh so it right .
A :  Just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . Um
A :  We're gonna just do a quick opening and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training .
A :  Essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . Um we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this and then just a bit of discussion close up . Um I guess you know game or something um in real life um so yeah basically
A :  I want to I'm just gonna you got of course you can discuss that , I'm thinking about um uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . Um so um if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , um y is
D :  You're just gonna believe me , we'll go from there . Fair enough .
A :  Exactly . Um I mean obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if I'm like we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book you know
A :  um you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of X_ obviously go with it . I mean we'll discuss it but
A :  I'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like yeah yeah exactly so , 'cause we're what we're sort of role playing is y g yeah you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um .
D :  Prove it yeah , okay .
A :  And that's the same for your when we do introductions I mean um and you talk about your background you know have fun , you know maybe you went to um
A :  uh you know maybe i you're like in Maine you went to U_C_S_B_ but you wanna say you went to Harvard or something like that , why not , you know you can this is you know I guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . So are you guys okay with that does that seem logical ?
B :  Oh yeah , that's fine .
C :  Sure .
D :  Works for me .
A :  Sweet .
A :  Cool . So I guess that that we're totally we're making a remote control which is thrilling um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model I dunno if you guys had time to check the in real life I dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website .
B :  Right .
A :  Um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff that nobody really thinks about and try to make it nice you know like John Lewis nice or you know if you go to Debenham's or something .
A :  So um basically we are reinventing the wheel but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . Um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics .
A :  And that's where I'm gonna need you guys the User Interface Designers and the um um the other designer that I can't remember , the the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ right um the Industrial Designer hey right on alright , getting into it um
C :  Mm .
D :  There you go .
A :  to guide me and guide us on this project 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom you know you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know X_ and Y_ um at the same time .
A :  And then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , you know like um I I think you guys probably got the same emails I did but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that .
A :  Um and so we'll work up from there and um then we'll meet on and talk about it and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go take the the the
A :  take the basics and make it nicer and then ov obviously uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible
A :  um to try t of sync it all up . So that's the detailed design . So it's a three stage kind of thing . Um right so for now just for th the white board um
A :  basically uh just to get used to it , I haven't tried it yet either um I'm just gonna start and um mm carry like five remotes around
A :  um and just write down I'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs you know if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five C_D_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , if you wanna write all five go for it but name one of them that you could um . Oh , we skipped introductions . Nice .
A :  I'm a excellent Project Manager . Um . I'm Marty , um I went to uni at uh U_C_ Santa Barbara and I'm here working on a P_H_D_ in psychology . Um yeah . So
D :  I'm Sarah , I went to Michigan , and I'm here doing cultural studies and I'm the Marketing Manager or something . Marketing , yeah Expert . Expert . Fine . That's me .
A :  Expert Don't play yourself down .
A :  Expert
C :  I'm Ron . I uh once upon a time studied in Victoria and I am the User Interface Designer .
B :  I'm Nathan , I'm from California , and I'm here doing a Masters degree in social anthropology .
A :  Where did you go to uni Nathan ? Oh brilliant . Cool . My little brother goes there . Right so desert island discs . Yeah .
B :  U_C_L_A_ . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  So .
D :  So do we have to wait for you to write it down or are you gonna tell us ? I'm waiting to know .
A :  Well I'll t i no no yeah I'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down . See I'm a big music fan I don't know if you guys are , I'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent but
D :  Uh
D :  Fair enough .
A :  there's some other options , if you're a T_V_ slut like I am like Smallville terrible television show but I happen to love it , it's rubbish but I love it .
D :  Oh , Smallville . I went to high school with Tom Willing actually .
A :  T the the main c the main character ? Wow .
D :  The guy . Yeah .
A :  Is he a wanker ?
D :  Yeah . Very much so . Hell of a soccer player but a total bastard nonetheless .
A :  He looks really tall , like he's gotta be like six six . Yeah . Um okay so I really like Jeff Buckley . You guys heard of Jeff Buckley ? Um that's cool 'cause like not very many people have . Um and um oh well I might as well throw a British person in there um you can't go wrong with Radiohead . It's a r
D :  Yeah . He is a big guy . Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Good call .
A :  Okay so it really works just like a pen only makes noises I think . It's kinda weird . Anyway yeah . Yeah , you're like press and it's . Kinda cool . You'll see . Alright so um whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want .
D :  Interesting .
D :  I guess I'll go next then . Okay . Don't wanna lose all my mikes , plugged in here . Okay . This is basically just pen practice huh ? Okay . Oh you're much taller than me so I'm gonna write down here .
C :  Go for it .
A :  Right on .
D :  Um .
D :  Right now I'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of , Chris Bathgate , local Michigan folk singer , really lame and uh
A :  Mm .
A :  Nice .
B :  Wow .
D :  uh what else did I bring with me ?
D :  Probably classical , to totally geek it out , yeah I think .
A :  Okay yeah yeah .
D :  And my family guy D_V_D_s but we don't need to write that one down . So yeah .
A :  Well yeah . Oh , family guy . Isn't h has h do you watch the new season ?
D :  No . Are you getting it online , or is it on sky ? Yeah , that'd be nice .

B :  No .
D :  'Fraid not .
A :  Afro beat orchestra ? Very cool . Mm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Sounds nice .
A :  Wow .
D :  Exciting .
D :  That'd be .
D :  Oh . I didn't even read those .
D :  Oops . I shouldn't admit that .
A :  That's what a PowerPoint presentation is for . It's they're designed specifically to ignore . I it's th brilliant .
B :  Oh , wow .
D :  Yeah . It's the five by five , I can't read that much .
A :  Ah yes yes yes okay I see that . Vomit . Yes . Street pizza . It's so brilliant .
D :  Yeah oh it's so horrible .
C :  Love um
A :  I've seen more urine in this city than ever before , I mean
D :  Oh my God . Seriously ?
C :  I just came from Glasgow and I'm um happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately . Um . I w
B :  There's more vomit there .
A :  It's so minging .
D :  It really is
A :  Uh .
C :  Does uh yeah . Ready ? Minging ? Nice .
B :  Alright . Yep .
D :  Yeah . Slide it in there . Yeah .
A :  I'm going local . Going local . I have to be here for three years so I might as well get the terminology right .
D :  Yeah fair enough .
D :  I've already got more than I can keep track of . And I'm gonna go home next week and everyone's gonna be like oh my God you're turning into one of those people , no .
A :  Oh , have you been home yet ? They'll be like , say something British , and you're like oh shut up family .

C :  Uh-huh .
B :  Um
B :  Let's see .
A :  Right you s you're gonna stay here ?

D :  Probably . Or at least get a work visa for a while and then decide .
A :  Wow .
C :  Nice .
D :  'Cause nice .
A :  Bad religion ?
B :  Yeah , that's the music I grew up listening to .
D :  Of course .
A :  Yeah yeah , yeah .
D :  Oh , now I can think of so many other ones .
B :  And so there
A :  Well yeah that's why yeah .
D :  That's how it works .
B :  Something I miss about my hometown .
A :  I miss coffee . Burritos .
D :  Mm . Oh
C :  Nice .
B :  that cost less than eight Pounds .
D :  Any thing that are like free .
A :  Oh yeah two two bucks .
A :  Where are you from in California by the way ?
B :  I grew up in San Diego , but yeah um La Jolla , P_B_ .
A :  Did you really ? What part ?
A :  Yeah I'm from San Diego as well .
D :  Nice .
A :  Yeah oh man .
B :  But really uh I last lived in San Francisco , I haven't lived in Cali well I haven't lived in southern California since I was eighteen .
A :  Going to s like North Carol I'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in San Diego .
B :  It's different . 'Cause in San Diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill and in northern California they steam them .
D :  It must make all the difference .
B :  Yeah , it really does .
A :  Well it's it's i there's other things too there's you just can't place it like I when I went to school in the U_ in Santa Barbara which is central California
D :  Ah .
A :  the Mexican food is okay , it's just not good like and yeah it's like two bucks , like literally two bucks for this massive I miss yeah good call on that .
B :  Mm .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah . Where you from in San Diego ?
D :  Mm .
A :  Um just literally just metropolitan San Diego , I live like five minutes from the zoo . So North Park actually if you want to get real specific .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , my grandparents lived on um thirty second .
A :  Yep .
B :  Close t uh do you know where Clare de Lune coffee shop is , and
A :  Yes . On university , yeah . Yeah it's actually like literally half a mile from my house . Yeah , pretty cool . Small world as we were discussing before .
B :  Cafe Forte
B :  Cool .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Especially when we're all from the same general region . Right so okay , success on the whiteboard . You can harness the awesome power a little bit introductions we talked about some of our C_D_s and things we like about the city you know , I think we'll
D :  There you go .
B :  Wow .
A :  Um right so moving on to not fun stuff uh project finance . Um basically what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five Euros . Um .
A :  This is what the finance department has told me , the C_F_O_ but I don't know , I'm not sold on this , it's pretty dear , I mean twenty f that's like you know
A :  forty bucks for a remote . It would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . Um so what we can maybe work on that a later but we're gonna make a lot on it , the profit aims to make fifty million Euros on it .
D :  Mm .
A :  Eur internationally . So um one of the things I I was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um so something that could do N_T_S_C_ as well as PAL as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control D_V_D_s but um you know I'll leave that to you guys but that's something that i i it is gonna be an international sold thing .
D :  Makes sense .
D :  Uh .
A :  Um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty . So we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can .
A :  Um s right so um just to close up , I'm not sure how much time I've used mm next time right Project Manager , sorted . Um .
A :  Is uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so um and I'd like the um Industrial Designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it .
A :  Um U_I_D_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do .
A :  Um mm basic and um so I need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want . So actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , you know like uh so
D :  What they're looking for .
D :  And negotiate that . Uh .
A :  yeah well it is and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between um so yeah specific instructions will be sent in your email . But I think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um
A :  and as more things come up we'll have meetings and you'll get emails and so forth . Um any questions , before we get started ?
C :  I assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control , we can't kind of build it into other uh products .
A :  You mean to like
C :  For instance like a mobile phone or something like that .
B :  Mm . Sounds interesting .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I don't think there's any rules about it yet . So
B :  Maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Or or you know can we produ can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ?
D :  Mm .
A :  Well , have a think about it . I mean I'm I'm certainly op it seems like yeah it it seems like it's certainly do-able isn't it . I mean um or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function . The clapper . No I mean no , good idea , good idea . We'll see what see what
C :  Yep . Okay .
D :  W yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Maybe a remote with changeable faces , like the faces that you can buy for phones . Yeah .
C :  Nice . Hot .
D :  I like the little cover thingies .
A :  Uh-huh y I like that
A :  Yeah . That's true , I guess we we probably have some time , maybe we should brainstorm a bit like what we wanna do , go back to um
A :  I don't really have any . Let me bring up something about
A :  our basic goals here , what we want to accomplish . Uh project announcement .
A :  Ts ts ts
A :  Yeah . Not so much .
D :  Hmm .
A :  All right we'll find them , we're on our own .
C :  Now are we also discussing kind of our initial ideas at all here ?
A :  Yeah yeah let's do it , let's do .
C :  S does anybody have any initial ideas ?
A :  I'm gonna go ahead and take notes on this too 'cause
D :  Good idea . Start your minutes . Um
A :  Yeah I mean oh yeah right . So initial ideas .
D :  Well it's pretty much given it's gonna be universal right , we decided that already and it may be functioning for other things ,
A :  Yeah .
D :  as soon as you said that I was thinking like all the other things you could get a remote to do , like your microwave or your front door or like to have everything on one thing , but then , I've never been a fan of those huge remotes that have like a million buttons , you can't tell what they do .
B :  Yeah .
B :  S smaller's better . Simple .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But I'm thinking I'm thinking kind of P_D_A_ uh design so touch screen design rather than button so that you can kind of flip around all sorts of different things .
D :  Specific .
D :  Okay .
B :  Oh right . That'd be different .
D :  Interesting .
A :  Yeah that's slick isn't it . I mean like stylist yeah like a just a yeah . Right so we got five minutes more to chat about this , perfect . Um so we've got this kind of an idea of a trade-off between um uh size and functionality . Um and we also
D :  True .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm . Right . We want it to be munt multifunctional but at the same time if you get it to do too much you're not gonna be able to tell them apart , that whole yeah .
B :  Yeah . It's gonna be too complicated , too crowded with buttons and things .
C :  Too confusing .
A :  I'm also gonna note for future reference this idea of um so you like maybe like an L_ like a touch screen type of remote ?
D :  Hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm . Possibly .
D :  Mm .
A :  I don't think one exists . Be a good idea .
D :  An interesting option .
B :  Needs it needs one outstanding feature to set it apart from all the other remotes .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Definitely .
A :  Yeah all the other universal remotes . Um I don't know if there's such a thing out there , I guess we could do some uh do some research on or one of us could do some research on it about whether or not there are um multi-format like um you know PAL , N_T_S_C_ , region one
D :  Right .
C :  I'm pretty sure there is . I mean I I have a friend who has a P_D_A_ that he just points at his telev any television he wants and it'll figure out the the specifications of it and will control it um so I th I assume that that can be done with uh kind of around the world .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  That
D :  Yeah .
A :  Interesting . Okay .
D :  Awesome .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Um all right . So . I li I'm liking that idea , this idea of a touch screen remote with multi-format features . Um .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right .
A :  Um .
A :  Let's see .
B :  I think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah . Keeping it nice and slick , would be important . And
D :  I don't know , like , there's such a problem with losing them , that adding this whole like P_D_A_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , so we're gonna have to be careful with what like
B :  Mm .
C :  Oh .
D :  Just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff but that would be really cool .
A :  Uh let's see . Um .
C :  I like the idea of the uh multi plate . In in
A :  Yeah yeah okay .
D :  Yeah . Fi b like what are they called , those face plate things ? Isn't there a name for them ? Are they ? I dunno .
A :  Think they're just called face plates ? I don't know .
B :  something , uh we'll have to come up with a name , patent it .
C :  I like . We should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . For those cold winter days .
D :  Yeah . Something really cool .
D :  Leopard print or something .
B :  Leopard print .
A :  Um .
D :  Hmm .
B :  I think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote .
D :  True .
A :  Mm . But if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote .
D :  Right .
B :  Mm .
A :  Um
C :  Well if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it . If you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either well there used to be those whistling devices but that's a little bit annoying .
B :  True .
D :  True .
D :  Right .
A :  Cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing that comes with the remote that you could place something else that you press and it makes the remote page . Kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes , could we do something like that ?
D :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
B :  I think so .
C :  That's cool .
D :  Probably .
C :  I think we could design into that .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Good .
A :  Um yeah I think this material quality as well like I guess what we can think about what kind of um uh you know Apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of you know
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah . And that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Curves .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . We do have the minimum am amount I mean we were talking finances I dunno , selling a a forty Pound remote would h or a forty Dollar remote , twenty five Euro remote would be pretty you know it's pretty expensive so maybe we might wanna trade off some of the features for a lower price .
D :  Right .
A :  Without without getting into that whole like you know go down to bargain store remote you know bargain store universal remote that's black and you know m massive , some kind of I dunno a balance there in somewhere .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  Definitely .
A :  But um have a think about what we can do , have a think about what we want to do , how we're gonna sell it and um
D :  Yeah .
D :  Or if you our users in mind , like these grandmas are not gonna be into this whole new let's design , no it's they're used to the buttons so we'll have to be careful of exactly who we're marketing this to , and who we're gonna be able to get it out of .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  'S true .
D :  But
C :  We're talking twenty five Pounds or twenty five Euros ?
D :  Euros .
A :  Twenty five Euros .
C :  Slight difference I guess .
A :  Yeah . They're all weaker than they're all stronger than the Dollar .
A :  Although , computer parts , all if you're gonna upgrade your computer , buy it in the States . Like um do you guys know Fry's ? Huge computer uh electronics store ?
D :  Mm .
C :  No .
D :  Mm-mm .
A :  They serve um right they sa tha s they will sell things overseas so you can buy stuff in America and have it shipped over for like twenty thirty Pounds about .
D :  Mm .
A :  Right so um let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , I'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents , so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  And uh right so thanks for that . Let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about bef uh goi h h getting into .
D :  With half an hour ?
A :  Um . Yes .
D :  'Kay . Perfect .
A :  Thanks guys .
D :  Cool .
C :  Thank you .
B :  Alright .
A :  Okay . Hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing . Um I'm Mandy and I'm the Project Manager . And I know all your names again , Courtney , Fenella and Amber . Alright . Okay , so first let's go through this PowerPoint .
D :  Yep .
B :  Yep .
A :  I wonder what button I press ?
C :  Just do it on the arrow .
A :  Yeah , or how about I just click ? Okay , here is our agenda for this meeting . Um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . We're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . Um tool training , we're going to , I guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . Um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting .
A :  Okay , here is our project . We're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly .
A :  And how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um We're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate T_V_ , blah blah blah . And we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . Same thing with conceptual design . Just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . That's pretty much the the whole process for today . And then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . Okay . Alright . First we're gonna start off by using our tools . And the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here .
B :  I think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing .
D :  We could
D :  Yeah , we could on here .
A :  Alright , let's go forward then . Um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . Even if you are not a good drawer like me . Alright .
B :  Artistic skills , nil .
C :  Fine .
A :  Um .
D :  Oh , thanks .
A :  Bless you .
B :  I draw like I'm in grade five .
A :  Oh do I .
A :  'Kay , about one more minute .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . And who would like to start us off ?
D :  I'll go . Um this is my picture . I drew fish I like fish , because uh , you know , their whole water-vascular system thing . It's pretty cool , and um they've got a pretty good habitat and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that's okay . Yeah .
A :  Alright .
A :  Only if they're piranhas .
D :  Yeah , they they're easy , you know .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . Who wants to go next ?
B :  I'll go . I drew a kitty . It's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat , but I love cats .
D :  No I I see it . Yeah , it does look like a cat .
A :  No , it looks like a cat .
C :  No , I kne I knew .
B :  I love cats because they're independent , uh they pretty much know what they want , they get it , they move on .
A :  I love cats , too . I'm a cat person .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I'm allergic to cats . Oh , okay .
B :  I'm allergic to cats , too .
A :  Uh .
C :  Ah .
C :  In my next life .
A :  If you're around one I had a roommate who was um allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , you know , it's weird .
D :  Yeah , yeah , if you're around them for a long period of time
B :  I still can't sleep with them in my room .
A :  Okay .
D :  Oh , yeah , this summer I , oh I had to live with cats . It was crazy . Yeah .
A :  Okay , Fenella ?
C :  Um , I drew a badger .
D :  Cool .
B :  Yay .
A :  Badger . Good choice . Why a badger ?
C :  Well , yeah . Uh
C :  I dunno , they're grumpy and nocturnal and
B :  Are you trying to suggest something ?
C :  Well , a little bit like the Yes . Um . And then , if you know Wind in the Willows badger . Yeah and then uh I don't know if you know Brian . He's Liverpudlian writer .
D :  Oh , okay .
A :  Alright .
C :  Um , that kind of books . Badgers are cool in that one too .
A :  Okay . And I'm last . 'Kay . Look at my sad sad giraffe . No , no , no , it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , but whatever . I don't know even much about giraffes , but I just love the way they look . They're just such odd creatures , you know . I I like that they're so unique and individual , I guess . I don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . Only seen a couple in zoos . Yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . Okay . Alright . Guess we're getting straight back into business here . Um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five Euro , and our profit aim is fifty million Euro . We're going to make this an international product marketed in the States , in Europe , in Asia . And um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty Euro per remote .
D :  No , that's good .
D :  You don't really have to , I mean , if you like 'em
A :  Okay . So we're gonna talk for a little while . Um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . Expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , anything that you can bring to the table for this project . So .
C :  Now ?
A :  Yeah . You wanna start us off ? Anybody have anything to offer ?
B :  Well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , right ? One remote for everything .
A :  Right .
D :  Right .
C :  And everything being Wait , we have what , sound system , T_V_ , D_V_D_ , V_H_S_ , uh TiVo ?
B :  Um .
B :  I think they'll be phasing V_H_S_ out shortly .
D :  Yeah , TiVo .
A :  TiVo .
C :  But it's still there , so
B :  Okay .
C :  if po if we're gonna do it
D :  It needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal .
A :  They're never universal . That's right . Esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , D_V_D_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the Yeah . Yeah . Something from Sam's club .
C :  Or if it's not like a Sony , if it's like a I don't know .
B :  So we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways .
A :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay , and um another thing that I think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . If it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't Nobody wants to buy those any more . They want the ergonomic ones . Yeah . Ones that ones that look high-tech , too .
D :  They want like the flashy lights . Oh like this came from Las Vegas .
C :  But at the same time are simple .
A :  Right . So that people like my mother can use it .
D :  Mm yeah .
B :  What about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay . Anybody have any experiences with remote controls that they can remember that
C :  Just bad ones .
A :  Yeah . That's true .
C :  Um .
B :  What kinda battery would we want to use ? Because battery changing is usually Okay .
C :  Double A_ .
D :  Double A_ .
A :  Do some of them use triple A_s though ?
D :  Yeah some use triple A_s . So double or triple ?
C :  Some but
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , I guess then it's
C :  If we need to do triple A_ we can , but most people usually have double A_s around .
A :  Okay . Yeah . But that has to do with the size of it too . Well , w as long as we know that issue is
C :  Right .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple A_ .
A :  Here we can
A :  Triple A . But it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . Hey . Anything else ?
B :  Can you with a small lithium battery ?
A :  Alright . Moving along .
A :  Oh , we're closing the meeting . Next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes . Here's what we're going to do . Um the I_D_ , which is who ? Okay , you're going to think about the working design . What do you think that means ?
A :  Okay . And U_I_D_ , the technical fun functions design , making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . Okay . And the marketing person , that's Courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . Right ? I would think so . Okay . And you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . Okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ?
D :  Right .
A :  Okay . This meeting is officially over .
A :  Here we go . Welcome everybody . Um , I'm Abigail Claflin . You can call me Abbie .
A :  'S see . PowerPoint , that's not it . There we go . So this is our kick off meeting . Um
A :  and I guess we should all get acquainted . Let's shall we all introduce ourselves ?
D :  Hi I'm Chiara , I'm the um Marketing Expert . Um , would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ?
A :  I think we'll get around to that , yeah . So this is just introductions yeah .
D :  We'll get round to that later . My name is Chiara and I'm the Marketing Expert .
A :  Okay . I forgot to s say I'm the Project Manager but I figured you all knew that already , um so .
C :  I'm Stephanie and I am the User Interface Designer .
B :  I'm Krista and I'm the Industrial Designer .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um so f here's our agenda for today . Um we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss
A :  then close . Um so . So our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . And to do this , we have to um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . So . We'll get to that . Oh there it is . Right . Functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . So throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . Um so we're gonna try out our white board .
A :  If we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal .
C :  So you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? Or just draw it ?
A :  Okay .
D :  I think both .
C :  Okay . Why don't we do both . Right .
A :  Yeah . Both . Yeah .
D :  Who starts ? We ought to decide who starts and all that . No ? Uh-huh .
A :  Any volunteers ? Does anyone know what they wanna draw ?
C :  Mm , I gotta think about it for a second like . Uh
C :  Does it have to be functional , trendy and user friendly ?
A :  I don't think so .
C :  Um .
C :  Okay , I'll draw . I'll draw one .
C :  Make sure my things here .
C :  Uh-oh .
C :  Right .
C :  Okay , my favourite animal is see .
C :  Oops .
A :  A dolphin . 'S like playing Pictionary .
C :  Yeah , it's
C :  Yeah , I guess it has a fin on top too , yeah .
C :  It's my dolphin .
A :  So what characteristics do you like about your animal ?
C :  I like its tail . Um , no , I think dolphins are really uh I dunno , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool , like they're graceful yeah , and they're so
A :  They're graceful .
A :  Sleek .
C :  Yeah they're sleek and they look intelligent and I don't know , they're I guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing .
A :  I don't know how intelligent that one looks .
C :  Yeah he he doesn't look that smart . He's a I dunno um they're I think it's cool the the um the interaction that or the th things that the reasons people seem to like you know you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim .
A :  Yes . Does anybody else wanna draw their animal ?
B :  Suppose I can draw an animal , yeah .
A :  .
A :  Uh-oh there goes the ten . It's a cat .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I don't know . They sleep all day , they're easy to draw .
A :  Do you wanna anything ? I dunno if the the ah .
D :  Uh yeah . Well I had the cat as well , but uh I've got a spare one .
B :  I think the pen is running out of
D :  So I'll use the spare one .
D :  Um but it's harder to draw um .
C :  And the pen's dying .
D :  Um .
D :  Uh .
A :  A horse .
C :  Horse .
D :  Um I don't really know how the legs go , but anyway I will do that .
A :  That's very good .
D :  Um , and the main reason is they're pretty . I think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , and I like the way they run and I used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . And I like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , I think that's pretty much it . Um
A :  Yeah .
A :  This cord's
A :  Uh . Right . Actually I haven't thought of anything yet . Uh
A :  It's a pig . So I'm thinking we should design a remote control that's
A :  water resistant , strong and furry . What do you think , yeah ? This is yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah . Although uh I'll just put there . Right .
C :  And furry .
C :  Textile tactile , tactile remote control .
C :  You're dragging a you have a tail .
A :  Oh my gosh , this is disastrous .
A :  Sorry about that .
A :  Okay . So moving on . Our selling price goal is twenty five Euro and profit aim is fifty million Euro . So I'm guessing that we're not actually in Scotland , we're in some European country . Um , and we will hope to sell this internationally .
C :  Sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ?
A :  Um selling price is twenty five Euro . Profit aim fifty million Euro .
C :  Okay .
D :  How many should we sell then ? Um , a lot , two two two million , two mi no , more f four million .
A :  Anyone a mathematician ?
B :  Two million .
D :  Four million . And it well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million .
B :  Oh , yeah .
D :  It is a lot . Uh .
A :  So f that's a fifty percent um uh .
A :  Um , I don't know what these mean because I didn't actually make the slide-show . Experience with remote control . So I guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical ,
A :  nice remote control . Um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have .
D :  Um , I think one thing is that it should be easy to find bec yeah bec
C :  I was thinking that too . I think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you I mean you always know where your T_V_ is , so just have a call button , I've always wanted that , so like you can push a button on your T_V_ Yeah , yeah yeah yeah , so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And even I think a little light . Um or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing . I dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  In which case you're going to be l but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound I don't know if it's expensive maybe to
C :  Yeah . I don't yeah I mean it but like I mean just I mean like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and I dunno .
D :  Maybe call is enough . But yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  What if it had something like um
A :  just like a magnet on the back of it and you could I mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . You know like a portable phone has a base , like just to have a home for it . 'Cause people just stick it on top of their T_V_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the T_V_ , so
C :  Yeah . Yeah , or if it had a yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
C :  Yeah , I mean
B :  Well that's why it's always in the couch .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , in in the couch . I dunno , it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and
A :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm .
C :  Yeah so we the project is now couches and remote controls .
D :  But even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . But that would really make it more expensive . But it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall . Something like that . And the other thing is
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ?
C :  Bigger .
D :  Not well it needs to be sort of
A :  Hand hand held size , yeah .
C :  Hand-sized .
D :  Yeah . I don't think you need a
A :  Not not huge , but
D :  But definitely not well I don't know .
C :  It can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it .
D :  No , it can't be , uh-uh .
B :  No it really wouldn't be .
C :  Or like or like a light thing . You know . I dunno . Yeah . Or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah . That would be really I'm sure we could do that for twenty five Euros a pop . Yeah . Uh .
A :  Huh .
D :  Like spaceship . Right . Um
A :  Little homing device . Um .
A :  Okay . So what do we think this remote control should
A :  Five minutes .
D :  Oh dear .
A :  Till the meeting oh right . This is what we have left .
C :  I also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , 'cause I hate that when they have too many buttons and I mean I know it has to have enough functions but like , I don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . So .
A :  Um , oh we just
B :  Yeah , I agree . B_ button and the F_ button , they don't do anything .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah yeah .
A :  You what if um may be a little fancy but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . Like the way a mobile phone does .
C :  That would be cool .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . I mean it just seems like yeah .
A :  So you could like um like if you have I dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can the way you do it on your radio is that you uh what do you call it s y yeah but you can programme , so you can programme like your favourite channels , so like if you had a s
D :  Select . Uh .
D :  But , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen .
A :  That's something we could decide . Mm .
D :  Because
C :  I guess they would go together somehow ? I dunno .
D :  Because , I don't know if it's I think it's e expensive , if you have if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote , and then use the telly as a screen .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
D :  But um
C :  I'm thinking kind of
D :  But yeah for sure . Something like not it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do , is that what you mean ?
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Right . Mm .
C :  Or like you h you see those you know people I'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know their their entire house is so electronic , and they have like this one master control that and it's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control and it has like a screen and like so I think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , I don't know if it must be it would probably must be ex too expensive though t like I dunno .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah that's true .
A :  Yeah . I mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
C :  Well , I guess we have to get to that later , yeah .
A :  Um but it's something to think about , yeah . I mean we'll have to see how much that would be .
D :  Or some it i we can find out probably on the internet how much it's
A :  Yeah .
D :  Um . Yeah , and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um
D :  What was the word ? Water resistant .
C :  Furry .
A :  Oh I was just
D :  No but it's I thought , ah , spot on . Good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel , maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Mm , mm .
D :  That's quite annoying .
A :  Maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your like that's another
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , clip .
D :  Ooh .
D :  Um .
A :  Um . We should probably start wrapping up , um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . Um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , which will be in another thirty minutes . Um .
A :  So .
A :  Yeah . The
A :  Industrial Designer , what does that stand for , I_D_ , yeah um is going to be looking more into the working design . So I guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . The
B :  Yeah I think so .
A :  something , what is the U_I_ ? Yeah , what does it stand for again ? User Interface Designer . So that's gonna be
B :  User .
C :  That's me .
C :  Uh , User Interface design .
A :  more technical . I guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w
C :  So technical function .
B :  The working design is the structure .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  What is technical functions exactl I I don't really know what
A :  Um , I guess you'd have to find out .
D :  It says on that email but it
B :  Um .
B :  It was in the email . I wrote down what mine were .
C :  It does but it I just don't really
D :  It said um
C :  Yeah .
D :  It said
C :  What effect should the thing ha should it have , okay . Alright . And working design . Okay .
D :  Yeah like
D :  Be a medium between you and the telly I think , that's uh
C :  Yeah , yeah . Alright . And how it works , okay . Right . I'm I'm on task .
A :  Mm .
A :  And the M_E_ , what does that stand for ? M
B :  Marketing .
A :  Marketing , right . Um .
D :  Marketing . Oh it's written here , but um .
A :  So we'll be working on the user requirements , um
A :  Yeah . So I guess that wraps it up . I'll see you all in thirty minutes .
D :  Okay .
A :  I just did .
A :  Right w welcome to the the first meeting of uh Real Reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control . Uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so um which we want to to build on , taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody , uh one that everybody wants , uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company .
A :  Uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . Um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital to this project um I'll just go round th the table , Andrew , marketing , um m Kendra with the uh um designing the the the User Interface uh uh and Kate with the the industrial design . Um .
D :  Mm .
A :  What's uh the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want , uh everybody has a contribution to make and uh
A :  everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . Um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody knows everybody else , everybody's worked for the the company for a while , if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh uh everybody's experience is please do so . Uh
A :  in fact I'd I'd I'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make . So we'll start with Andrew .
D :  Oh my name's Andrew I'm a I'm the Market Research
D :  person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control and uh yeah I'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view .
A :  Right Kendra .
C :  I'm Kendra and I'm the Us User Interface Designer and um I haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before but I'm m so I'll be
C :  working on the design .
A :  Right at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas so .
C :  Right . Yep , I'm just open to being creative .
B :  Uh I'm Katie , I'm the Industrial Designer and I'll just be I guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control and uh yeah .
A :  Yep , good .
A :  Okay , very very quickly , um this I don't want to make this meeting too structured because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank . Everybody says what they what they want to say , uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . The the remote control needs to be original , there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different , uh I want one , um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the I want it
A :  uh scenario . User-friendly as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly so we want to make ours one that people can pick up and think oh yes that's it's obvious how that works , uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that I may not need another remote control but uh it's such a nice one I'm gonna have one . And last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants .
A :  The uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production .
A :  Uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um
A :  In fact I suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um
A :  So I I everybody knows what whiteboard is so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , but le let's go round the table , your favourite animal .
D :  Um , badger . Uh it's it's got nice contrast with black and white and uh I feel they're underdog kind of status and they're , the
A :  Mm and why ?
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Oh right uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse 'cause of the the white streaks in it . Kendra .
C :  Um probably a duck I just I li I like the way they look and they're just nice animals and I like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Right , okay .
B :  Uh 's horses , no particular reason why .
A :  Uh-huh , fair enough yeah . I'm not sure that I've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , I think homo sapien because of their their uh overall ability to uh uh
D :  Make mobile phones and T_V_ remotes to make T_V_ remotes .
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Indeed absolutely yes , tha that's um
A :  Okay and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five Euro um , we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million Euros so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . It needs to cost twelve Euros fifty to make . Um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product , we're looking at making it at a very good price . Um , okay , um would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls .
C :  Well I think I find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the D_V_D_ player or whatever and the T_V_ as well . Um , but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons and so I think it's is best when they're clearly labelled and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , you know .
A :  No .
A :  Any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ?
A :  Or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? Are there you know , bad ones they've used or good ones they've used or ones that they've lost and never found again ?
B :  Um
B :  I think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself and twist your remote control to get it the T_V_ to actually pick up the signal .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Think a lot of the time , remotes that come with T_V_ players and T_V_s and D_V_ players , like they aren't
B :  Mm .
D :  like an area that's put a lot of effort into , they're very boring , very plain . Like it's very a very like um making a a stylish remote control would be a very like
B :  Mm .
D :  Easily put us one step ahead of the current competition .
A :  Um what so wh what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about ?
D :  Um .
D :  Something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control . So if you want , something that looks like uh something that makes you think oh what's this ? Like this pen doesn't really look like a pen , but it makes you think oh . So , sorry that's a bit vague .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  . Yeah d no I mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , people won't see it as a remote control um and uh
D :  Uh I suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to
D :  to make make people aware of the product .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls ?
C :  I think something that's comfortable to hold because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto , so something that's more comfortable that fits in a person's hand better .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  I mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses which um I mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops and s you know some quite fancy ones um than the some from personal experience which look nice but aren't particularly comfortable . Um any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Well from the mouse idea you could , remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it which you press , whereas if you want could all be flat and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button .
A :  Yes , I mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh
B :  Mm .
D :  I suppose .
D :  Easily , yeah yeah .
A :  fi find the button buttons easily .
C :  But maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down so you could feel them
D :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
C :  better .
A :  Yeah , that's uh must admit I don't think I've ever seen one with concave buttons , that's uh certainly be different . Um do we need it to uh I can't think of any re remote controls that I know of that actually light up at all . Do we do we want uh
C :  Oh yeah .
B :  Mm that would be good .
C :  Like a like a mobile phone ? Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm , yeah that would be good .
B :  Mm .
A :  Okay . So , Andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something which there are already millions out there and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire
A :  um the planet with ?
D :  Mm-hmm , um especially if we try to sell , what two million of them .
D :  Oh sorry , four million of 'em , but uh
D :  I think if w if we market it as as not as not well this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two we could have parallel marketing s schemes where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable and like you just it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra I wan I want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , but that might considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice , therefore they want it so make it practical at the same time . I think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room uh but also a device that uh
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  is practically sound . So um , I dunno we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , yeah , yeah , well I d I think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of . Um okay well first thoughts on um
D :  If you .
D :  Mm .
A :  the the industrial design side .
B :  Oh I think it's it's remote controls are kind of a unique object 'cause it's you depend on them so much , but you don't i i it's you sort of just assume they're always gonna work , you don't think of them as a comp like a computer can break down and you're kinda like oh well fair enough there's all these complex things going on , it's gonna something's gonna get messed up eventually . They they just need to be very very dependable because people sort of take them for granted and then if your remote control breaks it's
B :  God forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel it just it needs to be very effective , very always dependable . Uh I don't think we should make it too small I 'cause I think it needs to it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward , but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah .
A :  Indeed .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But so yes dependable , and have a good medium range size .
A :  Okay , and um colours , materials ?
A :  Kendra , anyone ?
C :  Well , most I think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , so maybe we should go with something different or be able to I was just thinking of um what they're doing with mobile phones now how you can get the different um what are they called ? Like the face-plates that you change so we could have maybe I don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , where you can change the face-plates or have kind of a variety so people can get different different things . Have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , probably just plastic because that's always the lightest .
A :  .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm , mm-hmm .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Right .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay that's uh
A :  Again I don't think that's ever been done before , it's uh the sort of the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that I haven't got and uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  might need so . Uh Andrew , any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ?
D :  Um , well we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour or with like you buy it with several
D :  uh like
D :  you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy or as a separate thing , but uh maybe thinking of that , it's considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one and then forget about it . Unless you were trying to
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think
B :  Well you could come up with like novelty ones , like they've done with the the mobile phones , you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control and sorta stagger the release of them and get people like oh I want that cover on it now and that'll keep them spending money .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Oh it's that's a that's a good idea .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-mm . Right , okay I think we've got um a good idea now . We uh meeting is uh
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah true .
A :  Needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . So uh um we've got thirty minutes to
A :  start looking at the um at the design in more detail . Um
A :  then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes and try to get some of these ideas uh
A :  uh more formalised . Uh thank you very much indeed .
D :  .
C :  Okay .
B :  Thank you .
D :  Is this okay ?
A :  Uh yeah . Fine now .
A :  Oh , it's not liking us , it went that-a-way .
A :  Computer adjusting . Oh .
A :  Uh .
A :  Okay . So .
A :  Right .
A :  You ready back there ?
A :  Uh okay .
A :  Welcome everyone . Um this is the kick-off meeting for the day . Um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for Real Reaction .
A :  As you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , um become acquainted with each other , um have a little training on tools , uh create a plan , discuss things and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total .
A :  Okay . The new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . That , Steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . The originality um is gonna take all of us . Um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , Sarah . Um and we'll get on with it . Okay , so we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design .
A :  Okay ? Right . Everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . Kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , I guess
B :  Uh yeah , if I can pick up with all these bits and pieces , hang on .
A :  And while you're doing that we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around .
B :  Uh right , so you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . Do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? Um
A :  Uh I do not think so , I think it's just to try out the whiteboard .
C :  Are we all gonna draw a cat ?
D :  I know .
B :  Only animal I could thin I could draw .
A :  Ah .
B :  Its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . You can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears . Um I suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay .
B :  Right , yeah .
A :  Great . And the characteristics ?
B :  Um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers I think , um because they're the easiest to draw . In fact , I'll give it some more
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  Oh , and the tail
A :  Okay .
A :  Fantastic . Since you're handy as well , why don't you do yours next , Steph .
A :  I think it's to get us used to using the pen .
B :  Yes . Um sure it's not to test our artistic
A :  Uh no .
B :  It's a mouse .
A :  A mouse-y ?
C :  That's not a mouse-y , no .
B :  No it's not a mouse .
B :  It's a wombat .
A :  Oh .
C :  It's a ratty .
A :  Argh . Rat .
B :  A what ?
C :  A ratty .
A :  Not a mouse , a rat .
B :  A webbed foot . Webbed f Oh right .
C :  It's clothes . That's it's clothes .
C :  It's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail .
A :  And your favourite characteristics of that animal .
C :  I love whiskers .
C :  Uh they're intelligent and they're cheeky and
C :  uh fantastic pets and very friendly . And they sit on your shoulder and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework .
A :  Oh . Okay . Kate ?
D :  Thanks .
A :  Oh , a fish .
B :  Gosh , why didn't I think of fish ? That's even easier to draw than cat .
C :  A shark ?
D :  Mm this is very representational fish . Um I like them because they're sleek and they have a lot of freedom but they also do n uh swim in groups , so .
A :  Oh , okay . Fine .
A :  Favourite characteristics ?
A :  'Kay .
A :  So they have team elements .
D :  Do you have a favourite one ?
A :  I'm afraid I'm with Steph .
A :  And I think your pen's running out of whatever .
A :  But I'm afraid I take the coward's way out , and the cat's looking the other way . He's hiding .
A :  Um cats are sometimes very independent . My parents had cats . Uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best .
A :  Okay .
A :  Now um we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five Euros , with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million Euros . That tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . Um would be an awful lot of these , would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five Euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . Um the production is to only cost twelve and a half Euros per item .
A :  Now if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half Euros each . Um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , that's t uh can you do the maths and how many are we selling ?
D :  Uh yeah . I was just wondering if that's the um
D :  If fifty percent is normal
A :  Mark-up ?
D :  B yeah . Um I would think would be more like sixty percent .
D :  But um let me I have two thoughts . One hundred , fifty percent .
A :  Okay .
D :  And and your question is how many do we have to sell ?
A :  Yes , 'cause our market um is international and your problem is has to do with marketing of you know , you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that .
D :  At twenty five .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , that's um
A :  To give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking .
D :  So that's four million of them ?
A :  Something like that ?
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That's fifty million Euros . In order to make fifty million Euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each
D :  And if we make
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  That's a lot of selling .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Two four
D :  Four million .
A :  To be fifty , be four million . You'd have to sell four million .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Okay ?
A :  Right .
A :  Experience with a remote control . Any of you use of remote control for a television or D_V_D_ or something ? You're both nodding , all three .
B :  That that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a in a home environment , for a T_V_s and
D :  Yeah .
A :  I've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , but I also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another .
C :  It is true that you always sit around you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the D_V_D_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . But I presume this is t I presume this is just for television .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Y yeah .
A :  And they don't always talk to each other .
A :  Don't know .
A :  Okay . Are there any um ideas for the remote ? What would it be for and what group would be be for ?
A :  We have to think about that one .
D :  We could make a Hello Kitty
D :  themed remote .
C :  I think one in b bright colours would be good .
D :  Yeah . We could totally go for the Japan-a-mation . Well I mean there's also the cachet that um uh the Japanese make great products . Electrical their industrial design is very good .
B :  I think one that works would be good .
C :  I think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . Like I've got one at home that has
C :  well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume ,
D :  Yeah .
C :  you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that I've got no idea what they do , like .
D :  Well , that's a really good point , because I think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , you know , so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . We don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down .
A :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm . We can make it smart like an iPod , you know , make everything menus .
C :  Ooh , closing the meeting .
A :  Yeah . Um I know this sounds like it was very quick , but the
C :  That was quick .
A :  I think that's the industrial design is the first one , that's Kate , for the working design . And user , that's you S Steph , for the technical functions design , and for marketing the user requirements specification . I think there's going to be a lot of we have to help each other and work through this as a group , and I think we all , you know , we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , but I think we all have to like each other um to get this done . Uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , but uh I don't think they allowed a lot of extra time , so I think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . Do you all agree ?
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright . Um then I don't see any reason to prolong it and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now and go into other things . Alright , so this is the end of the first meeting . Thank you all .
D :  Okay .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Right , so
A :  start of the first meeting . Uh .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right , so agenda of the first meeting . Where we uh
A :  We have twenty five minutes for this meeting . We uh are to get acquainted . So does everyone want to say who they are ? that seem sensible ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I'm Robin . I'm the Marketing Manager .
C :  I'm Louisa . I'm the User Interface Designer .
B :  I'm Nick . I am the Industrial Designer .
A :  And I'm Alastair and I'm the project leader . Alright okay , so tool training . Um .
A :  Project plan . So does anyone have any uh thoughts
A :  as to the tool training that uh is required ?
B :  Tool training .
C :  I'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training .
A :  Neither am I .
A :  Oh I see , so we shouldn't really be
A :  Oh right okay , so . So we have the project team , which is to um basically to come up with a new r remote control device . Uh we have uh the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time . And uh our idea is to uh
A :  to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one , and to to be trendier , to be with it , and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience . So um method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . So um
A :  in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this uh
B :  Yes .
A :  this device . And uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a
A :  better better inst implement than we had before . And therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day . Um
A :  and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end . So we've got tool training . Try out whiteboard . Uh . So we will um . Right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . I guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works . So uh I don't know who wishes to go first . Do you wish to go f Have a first bash at uh whatever .
D :  Mm-hmm , okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  I don't mind .
D :  I dunno .
C :  Um .
A :  Ah uh .
C :  Let's see . Good job I got pockets today .
D :  Your microphone's just
A :  But now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera . I take it that
C :  Are we supposed to do this right now , do you think , or ?
A :  I would I would guess so . Or
D :  Yeah . I don't know .
B :  You've lost uh your microphone there .
C :  Oh .
A :  Technical problems . I mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things .
C :  Right here we go .
C :  Okay . I think that I would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat .
C :  Little smiley cat there .
C :  Um and this would be
C :  because they're very independent , uh they're very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe . Um and they can be very very affectionate . Some people don't think so but I know very affectionate cats . Um .
C :  Um and they can look after themselves .
A :  Next .
B :  Okay , yeah . I'll I'll
C :  Shall I rub that out , actually ?
A :  I don't see as there's any need to . There's plenty of space . I mean whatever .
D :  We can have have a whole menagerie .
A :  Exactly .
B :  Shall I see if I can get across without just tangling everything .
B :  Okay . There's one .
A :  We've had more time to prepare over this side , so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets .
B :  Didn't think of that .
B :  'Kay uh pens are over here . I'll try the red pen .
A :  The three pens are underneath .
B :  Okay . Um . I'm gonna go for the bear which I'm be able to draw very well , but
A :  You get marks for artistic impression .
B :  I'll have a bash at it .
B :  Uh .
B :  Ooh ooh I lost it there . I think I've just knocked the microphone . Um .
A :  So you're just doing the face .
B :  We'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear .
B :  Um and I like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um
B :  I dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear like the jungle book characters and stuff like that . Great .
D :  Right .
D :  Hello . Um I'm gonna go for the dog , and I'm gonna draw one badly as well . Uh .
D :  looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something .
C :  That's quite good .
D :  Right . There's my dog . Um I like dogs because they're very loyal . And they're always happy , so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited . So um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . And they're also good for exercise as well . You can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . And and when they're tired they're quite cute as well , so .
D :  Okay , that's why I like dogs .
A :  Right , um . Well I've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time 'cause to be honest with you uh
A :  I'm not too keen on them anyway . Not to worry . So what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw . Uh
A : 
A :  As you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well . Anyway um . And uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . Whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away and uh
A :  change the water every couple of months , and buy in a few plants , so . Other than the fact that they keep dying , uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance . Right .
D :  Great .
A :  Okay , uh if we're still all with us . Right okay , so .
A :  Work has been done on uh
A :  this uh project where by um twenty five Euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price . That information has come from our marketing manager here . So we're looking to sell internationally , not just in Europe . We're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half Euro per unit . And therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  from that to give you your profit margin per unit .
A :  And so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time . So um
A :  Experience with remote control , first ideas . New remote . So I guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were . So uh any any thoughts ?
B :  Yes .
B :  Um I with some remote controls the buttons were a little small so they're quite hard to press so maybe we make something with uh
B :  easy to press buttons . As that is the main function .
A :  Okay , so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust and
B :  Yes .
A :  and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily . Um we're looking for a device
A :  that is uh What was the other things you said there ?
B :  Um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible .
A :  Easy to use .
A :  Use .
B :  is easy to use and see .
A :  And see . Okay . Uh .
B :  Yes .
C :  Can I just check ? Is this just a television remote ? Because a lot of um
C :  systems are kind of T_V_ video combined now , or T_V_ D_V_D_ combined . And one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . So if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
C :  Or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ?
A :  Oh I w um basically I'll get back to you on that . But it seems to me sensible , 'cause as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room . And uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  So a device for
A :  for all remotes .
B :  Sorry , you go . You go .
D :  Okay . Yeah . Um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . 'Cause there's quite often lots and lots . And um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . So whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . So so I don't we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room . I don't know .
C :  Comes to your whistle .
A :  Hmm .
D :  That's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but
A :  But is it in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive . You can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to 'cause you want you want simplicity as well , you want any idiot to be able to use it . Whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And so these are probably mutually exclusive options that uh Hmm you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , therefore they're more with handling them , therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on .
B :  Yes .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote . Or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , or sort of the instructions that would come with it ?
A :  Better instructions .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I mean
D :  we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops . So it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well , maybe .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . Um well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting . So uh we have to uh start winding up . Um is there Next meeting in thirty minutes .
B :  'Kay .
A :  So um
D :  Okay .
A :  Right , so we've got I_D_ the Come on , where's my
D :  If you just click return it should be okay . It'll get rid of the message .
B :  Or not .
D :  If you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message .
A :  Oh there we go . Yeah . That's what I was looking for . Right . So we've got function
D :  Oh you've got .
A :  Oh what happened to the
C :  I think that might be back to the start . Um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  slide four
D :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
A :  Right . Sorry about that . Okay , so we've got um the working design
B :  Okay .
A :  for I_D_ . For U_I_D_ the technical functions design . Marketing , the user requirement specification . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach . So .
A :  Are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ? And I guess I'll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
B :  'Kay , yes .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for . Is this a mun multi-functional one or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ?
B :  I think you just said at the start it was a television remote control , so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise .
A :  Television remote control .
C :  Right .
A :  That's true , 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going . But at this point in time I think you're right that uh shall we make it just a T_V_ . Okay ? So we will depart . We will stay here and uh and break off . And I'll do minutes and and we'll see you in half and hour . Okay . Right s
D :  Okay cool .
B :  'Kay .
B :  Okay , that's great .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay cheers .
A :  Alright , that did nothing . Okay . Welcome to the meeting everyone .
A :  Just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show .
A :  Sorry guys .
D :  You may have to do the function F_ eight thing . Oh , okay .
A :  I did . Twice .
A :  This'll just take a moment .
B :  Okay okay
A :  Or it won't .
A :  Okay we'll have to deal with it like this then . Alright . Um . This is the first meeting uh for developing our , our new product . I'm Heather , I'm your Project Manager .
B :  Okay .
B :  Hello .
A :  Okay . So um . So that was the opening . The first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . If everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name .
B :  Okay . My name's Poppy . I'm the Industrial Designer for this project . Um , I'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . Also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product .
A :  Nice to meet you Poppy .
B :  Okay .
C :  My name's Tara and I'm the User Interface Designer . I will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design .
A :  Alright .
D :  Hi , I'm Genevieve . I'm the Marketing Expert . I'm an expert at marketing . Um , I'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product . Um , I'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase .
A :  Alright I'm Heather and I've
A :  I said I'm your Project Manager , um
A :  Well you can pretty much read what it is that I'm doing . But um um
A :  Yeah .
A :  And uh tool training
A :  is one thing that we're going to be doing today , um um as well as planning the project , how we're going to , uh , create this product , and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , uh Which brings us to our next subject , is , um , um , as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control .
A :  Um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . And , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design .
B :  Okay .
B :  So this is a television remote control ? Yeah .
A :  Yes , it's a television remote control .
A :  Right . I believe I should be taking minutes on this right now . So , alright .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um , yeah .
A :  Um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um
A :  come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . Same with conceptual design and detailed design .
A :  So , um ,
A :  making sure that it , it's usable , that as a , um
A :  and that it's , it's feasible to create , and uh ,
A :  to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . Um , tool training . Is , is everyone , um
A :  Okay . Great . Great . Um
B :  Yeah . Got those notes .
D :  Yeah . Thank you .
A :  One thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . Um , one of them is our whiteboard . And , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , I , I'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . Um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . So , um , I , I'm assuming that we should do that now .
B :  Okay .
A :  'Kay . With our microphones still attached to our bodies . Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  Gosh .
A :  'Kay , what's my favourite animal ?
A :  Do come up .
B :  Oh , to go first . Oh , are we all doing it individually ?
A :  This is a team-building time where , um , , okay cool , um
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , let's stand up and support you
A :  My favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay ,
A :  right now it is an elk . alright , so
C :  An elk ? A vicious
B :  Okay .
A :  And it goes like
A :  Yeah it's got like big antlers , yeah .
A :  Looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head .
B :  Do you have elk where you come from ?
A :  Yes . Yeah we have moose and we have deer .
D :  We have moose too .
B :  You do .
B :  Okay .
A :  Do you have
C :  We have sheep .
B :  Sheep . Yeah , cows .
A :  'Kay , um .
B :  That's a great elk . Yeah .
D :  Uh-oh , we have a good artist .
C :  That is really good . I'm quite
A :  Thanks . This is my
D :  Oh , very shapely .
B :  Brilliant .
A :  Okay . That's a sketching of my my elk , and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , that um , that um In a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs and it uh But it can really overcome harsh terrain , and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , and uh
A :  it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . Right .
B :  Very nice . Okay .
A :  Right , I'm gonna take minutes while , um , you guys express your favourite animals .
B :  Okay , I'll go next . I am a big animal lover . I like all sorts of animals , but for the moment I'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently .
D :  Oh .
A :  Oh .
B :  It's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , but never mind .
B :  Not as artistic as Heather's drawing . Bit more cartoon style . But I like cats because they're so independent , and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . Um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , and generally just , they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing . Uh I reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . They know what they want . Basically , that's why I like cats .
C :  Very good .
A :  Great .
B :  I'll rub that out .
B :  There you go .
C :  Okay . I think my favourite animal would be a dog , but I'm not really sure how to draw one . I , I've never drawn a dog , I don't think . I'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause I draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw . Um ,
B :  Ooh .
A :  I forget her name .
C :  right it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause I'm not sure how to draw a dog .
D :  or Tara .
B :  Well there are loads of different types of dogs , so I'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog .
C :  It's a cartoon dog I think . A s I don't ev Oh , oh well . It's a scary cartoon dog .
C :  That This , that does not look like a dog . I'm sorry .
B :  We can pretend .
A :  It looks kinda like a person .
D :  That's Pinocchio .
C :  How do you draw a dog ? I suppose it has a lon Oh my god . Right . Yous know what it's supposed to be . It's a dog . . Um , I like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , and they're just such friendly animals . And , like they're more of a companion than cats . I've nothing against cats . Cats don't really like me , so I can't like them . But they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , that don't look like that .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , that's true .
D :  Alrighty . I feel like a robot . Okay . Um , well I guess I had the most time to think about it . I'm going to draw a butterfly , because I saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of Spring arriving . And it was actually the prettiest butterfly I've ever seen out in the wild , and I though that was pretty cool in Scotland . It was like , well it was a little pointier than that .
D :  At first I thought it was a dead leaf . And then it landed on the wall next to me . But this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . And then it kinda there was a green , I think it was a green ring , and there was like red going out like this .
A :  It's kinda like a peacock .
D :  Yeah , it kinda was actually , 'cause it was This part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , and I'm like , wow this is the middle of Scotland in like March . So I thought that was pretty cool . And it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . I wish I'd had my camera . So that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like Spring is finally here . Yeah . There you go .
B :  Very nice .
A :  Great .
D :  Uh , what do we Oh .
A :  Do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ?
D :  Yes I do .
A :  Yea
A :  Right .
A :  So , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , um or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , um , wanna make this um selling price of twenty five Euros . And so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um
B :  Okay .
A :  we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . Um , we'd like to , um
A :  to , uh , make fifty million Euro . I'm assuming that's what the M_ means . Um , and make it for an international market . Um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , V_C_R_s . Things like that , depending on which country you are . Another thing for the design team to think about . Um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve Euro and fifty cents .
D :  Okay , so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? Twelve fifty .
A :  I'm bad at math . 'Kay . Um , so now that , um , that is underway , um
D :  Okay .
A :  it is discussion time . So this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um
A :  suggestions that you may have so far , a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them .
A :  Does anyone have any initial thoughts ?
D :  I find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing .
A :  Mm-hmm . So what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Um
B :  I always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . It's always , where is the remote control ? So maybe if you could have some kind of
C :  Yeah .
B :  tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . I dunno , some kind of alarm . You can press a button on your wall , signal , 'cause it always gets lost .
A :  Yeah . It's a great idea . It's a great idea .
C :  Do yous not find that , um ,
C :  like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do . Yeah , I don't know what they do .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , that you don't use half of them .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  There's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . That's useful . So you just have like the number buttons , power button , T_V_ video button .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's , that's Yeah , it is . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . Anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . Maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like
A :  Any ideas will do that you have at this point .
D :  Could be shaped like a conch , you know . Be like a shell-shaped remote .
B :  Mm .
A :  Can hold it . Yeah .
B :  A novelty . Are we going into kind of novelty factors here . Like , I've seen phones like a Okay .
A :  Well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . I mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . Like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable But we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . So , hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . Um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right . Okay we have five minutes left . So , just to cover We have one more thing . Um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . Um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . So you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . Or not present but bring to the meeting . Um , I_D_ , whatever that stands for .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Interface ? Oh , industrial .
B :  Industrial Designer . That's me .
A :  Industrial Designer . I have to remember these things . Um .
A :  You'll be beginning your , your working design . Um , U_I_D_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . Um , maybe how this can be achieved , and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag Marketing Expert . Um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . And I'll see you in half an hour , okay ? 'Kay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Marketing Expert .
B :  Okay . Thank you .
A :  Okay . Oh , that's not gonna work .
A :  Oh , alright .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Um alright .
D :  Uh , uh , um .
A :  I'll just put that there . Uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . Uh I'm Nick Debusk , I'm the Project Manager . Uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um .
A :  Go ahead .
D :  Okay . I am Corinne Whiting and I will be the Marketing Expert and in each of the three phases I will have a different role . In the function design phase I will be talking about user requirement specification , and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , and I'll be doing research to figure this out . In the conceptual design phase I will be dealing with trend watching and I'll be doing marketing research on the web . And then finally in the um detailed design phase I will be doing product evaluation and so I will be collecting the requirements and ranking all the requirements to see how we did .
A :  'Kay .
C :  Hiya , I'm Ryan . Um I'm the User Interface Designer . Um likewise I've three different roles for each stage of design . Um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . Um in the concept design , the user interface , how the user reacts with the the product . And the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design , what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , what makes wha how we're gonna make it special .
C :  That's about it .
B :  Right . I'm Manuel and I'm the Industrial Designer in in this project um . In the functional design phase I'm I'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . Um I suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . Um um in the conceptual design um I'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . And uh the detailed design in the detailed design I'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um so we've got our opening , our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . Uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . Uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . Um so we are putting together a new remote control . Um we want it to be something original . Um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a
A :  fashion um conscious electronics company , so we want it to be trendy um and we want it to be easy to use .
A :  Um
A :  we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design um which basically is is the three of you um .
A :  w uh well um functional design um .
A :  Um do we have um
A :  any ideas of of maybe d let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , and then we can go into how we're gonna design it and
A :  and how we're gonna do the detailing on it .
C :  Yeah . Well uh s function of remote control is just just you know , change channels is its main function .
A :  So we want it to be um a T_V_ remote or I I mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ?
C :  Oh right . I suppose you c try make it a universal remote for could work on all sort of electrical
A :  'Kay .
C :  products in in one person's house . But , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm . 'Kay .
C :  I think they all work on the same prin principle as well sorta like I don't actually know . But is it just infra-red ? Is that standard ?
B :  Mm .
A :  I I think yeah , yeah , r universal remote . Um this is my first uh go-round with creating a remote control , so I think we're all in the same boat here .
C :  Ye yeah .
D :  Huh .
D :  Ours too .
A :  Um
C :  Um one thing I thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
C :  So if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , I thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature .
A :  So we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh
D :  Like a tracking device ?
A :  like a tracking device or or like a a
C :  Oh you can get those key well you could whistle or make a noise and it'd beep .
A :  It makes a noise , there's a button on the T_V_ that you press and
B :  Mm , mm .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Be good .
B :  So
C :  Generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance .
A :  Yeah . Do we want so they're kinda like long and rectangular . Do we want something crazy ? You know , we want something new that's gonna stand out . A m a modern so our remote should be
C :  Just long .
C :  Yeah . Black usually .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Lot more modern .
C :  I think so .
C :  Maybe sorta spherical or something . A ball .
D :  Maybe like user-friendly , like a little
C :  Yeah .
D :  you know , where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing .
C :  People I thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another if it was in a ball , and maybe the actual controls are inside or something .
B :  Mm .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Mm .
A :  Um .
B :  Well there are of course certain restrictions , you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , so there are always the some restrictions we have to apply here . Um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , that refers to the material , pretty much um . What are we gonna build that thing out of ? How sturdy is it gonna be ? Do we want it to last longer or rather have people
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  whatever , have to buy one every half a year ?
A :  Okay so yeah , so we want it to be sturdy , we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room or , as you said , people kinda throw it , so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , then it
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  It could be cased on the outside and t everything could be inside .
A :  'Kay . Um so we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy ,
A :  um
A :  So our form and our function . Um we want it to be um
A :  easy to find .
A :  Um
A :  What else
A :  it what else do we want it to to do ? So we want it to be universal .
A :  It's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five Euros um
A :  you know , goals for profits are I think somewhere around uh fifty million Euros , what they wanna make on it , so .
D :  Mm .
D :  Also since we're partners of the International Remote Control Association , maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal .
A :  'Kay .
D :  That's more on the research end , but the marketing .
A :  So marketing , you know , how maybe uh
A :  marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting .
A :  'Kay .
C :  Small .
B :  Right .
A :  Um
A :  Do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? Maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . Some ideas ?
A :  We want it to be a b a ball , you know , we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball and maybe th um where the buttons are located .
C :  I'd I could draw sorta the ball idea .
C :  My original idea was just simply
C :  sort of a sphere , where maybe you
C :  this is where it's connected together , and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , and then when you fold it out the middle
C :  Maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . If that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , and then you'd have
C :  just sorta you you you know , your buttons .
C :  Thing is inside I think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , so maybe as simple as possible , um as few buttons inside as possible .
C :  Um , I dunno , what's the idea for . Just something maybe if you ha if it had like if some kind of
C :  like light or something or lights around it . It's looking a bit like something out of Star Wars at the moment though , to be fair . But yeah .
D :  Futuristic .
C :  That was that was a sorta simple idea I had and then you know you could about
A :  Uh-huh .
C :  Right , it would almost be like a ball . So that was just just an idea I had . I don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ?
B :  Right . One problem you'd get with this design is um the ball is a nice idea because of it's stability really , but of course , since it's a ball , it'll roll , so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , take away that part . That's one of the big issues . Also also you risk the hinges here . That's that's um a problem .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Maybe f yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's g that's a good idea .
C :  Yeah . The idea it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , that was just one idea though .
B :  That's that's interesting of course , but that's of course a weak point , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  How would we go about um
A :  making you know getting rid of our weak points ? What I mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? Not to put you on the spot , but
B :  E No no , uh uh .
B :  N n
A :  What did you say your title was again ?
B :  Uh , I'm your Industrial Designer , so i b well , the point is
A :  You're the the Industrial Designer .
B :  well maybe I dunno . The shape is perhaps not the most ideal . As as stable as it is , there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so .
A :  Okay .
C :  Well I I suppose that things become design . But I mean i
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I was trying to think of like the design of others . I can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , maybe small , sort of fatter ones , but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  It's not new , it's not innovative , it's you know , everybody does long remote because it's easy , it's it's stable um .
C :  Yeah .
D :  'Kay , I'll draw something . What ? My idea was just to have it be kind of like a
A :  So if no , go ahead .
D :  keyboard type shape , you know , like video games l so . But maybe I mean that would be kinda big and bulky . We could also try to do the hinge thing , so it could like flip out that way . I don't know .
C :  Yeah .
D :  That's my idea .
C :  I think definitely doing something different
D :  Yeah .
C :  is a good idea .
B :  Mm .
C :  I mean maybe design something , that's sort of like uh I suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier .
A :  Something with a grip .
D :  Mm . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , with a grip .
A :  Yeah . Because even I suppose even with the ball
C :  It still might be hard to it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah .
A :  it's it might not be the easiest to hold onto um .
B :  Mm .
A :  So perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better . But then again , people like to use one hand to flip and one hand to hold their soda , so maybe maybe we
C :  Like yeah .
D :  True .
C :  Yeah .
C :  It's d yeah . I think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job .
D :  Mm .
A :  I feel like I'm just shooting everything down here . Uh um
D :  That's fine . You're the boss , you're allowed to .
B :  Well with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size w 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . So if the remote is too small it if it's small it probably looks better , but
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  may not be th as functional .
B :  So for that there's
A :  Okay , so unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . Um we've talked about our experiences with remote control and um we've got a couple ideas um .
B :  So
A :  Let's see here .
A :  What if we had what if we had not only um say we went with the ball the ball function um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um to make it easier to hold on to . So
A :  you know um s so it's easier to hold onto that way . Course that'll then remove some of our our ball . Unless this unless this part were raised , so say the cover flips over and covers that part .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So the grip is
A :  No , that wouldn't work either um .
A :  But if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . So if it were flat on the bottom and then had the
A :  sorta grips on the side here I guess ,
A :  and then
A :  flat uh
A :  And then we have the problem with the hinge .
A :  So if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , it'll stay where we want .
B :  The question is also , I dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ?
A :  Mm , that's true .
B :  It's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , so I don't know if a lid is a good idea . From stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . So it's don't make it too stable uh .
A :  So we don't have it flip open .
A :  We just have a ball
C :  But then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then .
B :  To the other design .
A :  Okay , so then we forget the ball . It looks cool , but it's really not it's not functional um . So we've got our sort of keyboard kind . What if we flipped it around here , so that it were um
B :  It looks cool .
D :  Looks cool though . Yeah .
B :  Uh functional .
A :  Sorry , that doesn't look anything like what you had there . Um so it's up and down , you hold it this way .
A :  Course then it's it's like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . But it's one-handed um .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right . Right .
B :  Question is what makes those game pads functional ? W I think that's pretty much the form for full hand . So it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , right , makes it nice , so that's the essential part . Except for that I think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
B :  'Cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing .
A :  Yeah , because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do .
B :  You know , all that dif batteries right , and
B :  Batteries go weak as well , so um after a while you have to point it towards the uh
B :  towards the equipment you wanna control with it , right ? So , have to m
B :  show which is the front , which is the back .
A :  Is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ?
A :  So that either way you're pointing it it would work .
B :  I suppose you could do that . O of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so .
A :  More expensive and yeah .
B :  Course you can do that .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Um
B :  I mean of course it'll be evident after a while or if you look at it , it'll it'll be evident which way around to point it , since you have the the numbers and the and the the buttons and stuff , but um it's rather about an instinctual thing , like you just grab it , you don't have to s look at it , you know , which way around to point it . Otherwise the design of or the the point of putting two sensors on both sides um would probably work .
A :  True .
C :  Put it
C :  Even if you designed it in some in a way that you know , isn't a rectangle , but still pointed in a direction that had definite points . So if that's your thing and you got something like that instead , and there's your s you kn you know which way you're gonna pointing it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Sorry to interrupt , but we have a warning to finish . Yeah .
C :  Um
A :  Are we out of time ? Okay , well , just to finish up , should we s go with this plan , start making some
B :  Mm .
A :  Are good ideas , what are not .
C :  Does it say what does it say for n it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , I think .
B :  Let's . Obviously
A :  Uh .
A :  Must finish now , so . And then marketing will look and see what uh what people want .
D :  Mm .
B :  Alright .
D :  Great .
A :  Okay . And Project Manager will design a better meeting for next time around , be a little bit more prepared . And uh alright , good meeting .
A :  So uh good morning . I see you all find your places . Is everybody sitting on the right place ? Yeah ? I guess so . So
D :  Morning .
B :  Morning .
C :  Morning .
D :  Yep .
A :  Let's see .
A :  First I will introduce myself . I don't know if uh if everybody knows me , so I'm Bart , hello . Hello . Bart . Hello . Hello . Bart . Welcome .
D :  My name's Frank .
B :  I'm .
D :  Thank you .
A :  Uh let's see . Uh let's start off um with a little presentation .
A :  Now first I'll tell you a little bit about the setting . You can see there are a few cameras here . They'll record uh our actions and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . Uh there are also some microphones there but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it . So is there a project documents folder ? There are some notes in it already I see , some documents . Uh I'll start with the presentation kick off .
A :  Is being modified by the administrator . Uh okay . Let's do it read only .
D :  Hmm , that's interesting .
A :  Well I don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for Real Reaction . Uh it's a company in uh electronics . We put fashion in electronics , uh we make it work , uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . I'm Bart the project manager so I'll direct you through the project .
A :  This is our agenda .
A :  Uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing .
A :  Uh maybe I can sit down , then I can take some notes or Let's see .
A :  Maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . I dunno it's not a lot of work , but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down . Uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . Aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . Um have you all seen the corporate website already ? Yeah . Have you seen any flaws in it ? I think I found one . No ?
D :  Sure .
D :  Yep . Visit it .
B :  Yep .
B :  Hmm ?
D :  Can't say I paid much attention to it , but
A :  I can
A :  see if it works this way . No , it doesn't work here . Okay no problem . But um on the corporate information side there's a th uh there was Real Remote instead of Real Reaction . Real Remote is not really the company we're we are , but it's just a little fault . Um okay , what are we going to do ? Uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . So these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . We've got the Marketing Expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look . And Industrial Designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original .
D :  Oh yeah .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  And we've got our User Interface Designer . He's also uh
B :  Yep .
A :  That's about the new remote control .
A :  Uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . First is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . After the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design .
A :  I had some role indications on here .
A :  But I think you know it already by yourself . The Industrial Designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . Uh the User Interface Designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . And the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation . So that's a bit what you're going to do . But that will be all worked out in uh other meetings .
A :  Then we've got our first tool training . We are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . As you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . Um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . Here are some functions . You can save . N uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , only undo , you can undo a little
A :  uh piece of drawing . A blank new document for each person . Uh select a pen , eraser . Capture we don't have to do anything with . Uh then we've got our pen . This pen . It's really funny because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of . You can also select the current colour and the line width . But then first you have to select the pen function . But we're going to work with it in a minute . So okay . Uh that's very simple and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Uh then
A :  a short thing about documents . We've got our shared folder , uh project project what was it ? Project documents I think . But all you will found that already because there are a lot of documents in it already , so it will be okay . And these are available on the smart boards as well , so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Here is a simple tool bar . It's what I just said , it's save , print , move back or forward one page . You can switch between the different drawings .
A :  And then we're going to try out the white board .
A :  So as you can see we g all going to draw a animal . Just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it . Mouse wasn't running away .
D :  That was interesting .
A :  Is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ? No . Okay . We're going to uh draw animal .
D :  Innocent .
A :  And uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . Um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . Uh there's I can start from now . I will . You can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . Because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked and then the drawing won't get good .
B :  Okay .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . 'Cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up . So we choose form of current colour uh I think grey is appropriate . Then the line width . I think seven will be nice . Now you'll see my drawing capabilities . These are not very much , but uh
A :  Uh , see you have to do it real slow .
A :  Oh
B :  Sure .
A :  Ah I was trying to draw a dolphin , but I think his nose has to be a little bit But it's close .
D :  I'm thinking about a swordfish .
A :  So what yeah it's this is bit of the swordfish . Yeah , he hasn't got an eye .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B : 
A :  Woah . Now we've got another function . We've got the eraser . And then you can undo
D :  .
A :  this easily .
D :  Meat .
A :  Ah it's okay . And I've got to write down a few of its characteristics . Uh is
A :  They've got no text tool , no .
A :  Uh .
A :  Okay . This is typically a undo action , I think . Pen .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe you have to hold it a bit
A :  upside-down . I think that's it because if you wan ar are going to do it like this then it will be a stripe . But I don't know , I'm just trying .
A :  This is not my work , okay . Maybe you have to use
D :  Hmm .
A :  Oh .
A :  Uh . I think it's a it wants to draw a another animal ? I don't know .
A :  It lives for the fun .
A :  So
A :  It's my characteristic uh characteristic about the dolphin . It lives for the fun . So now I'm gonna hand over the pen on the new blank sheet to you . Go ahead .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Thank you .
D :  Okay .
D :  Gonna use a different line width .
D :  And I'm gonna draw in black .
D :  There . 'Kay , I'm not much of an artist , but here we go .
A :  Maybe it's easier to draw the smaller line width , I think . Because this is going a lot better than uh I did .
B :  Hmm .
B :  A sheep .
D :  Mm .
D :  Okay . This is my um Hmm .
D :  Sheep .
A :  It's nice .
D :  With of course
D :  little blue dot they always get sprayed on their butts .
A :  Uh .
A :  It's a real dead sheep , yeah . For recognition , yeah , I see .
D :  There .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um maybe you can also write your name somewhere . On just a
D :  'Kay .
D :  They are
D :  Come on .
D :  You have to go really slow when you're writing .
A :  Yeah .
D :  They're brilliant animal animals . And that's just a little me thingy .
D :  So .
D :  Guess I'll pass the pen to our User Interface Designer .
B :  Okay . Um I'm just gonna draw its uh head , but mm
A :  Nice .
B :  Let's see .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh .
B :  Okay .
D :  Interesting .
A :  Sweet .
B :  Yeah . You know what that is ?
D :  A rabbit ? Garfield . Yeah .
B :  Or who ?
C :  Garfield .
B :  Ah okay , yeah .
B :  Just a
B :  Mm . Guess .
B :  So uh
B :  Yeah . That's enough .
B :  Um , you say a blank , or
A :  Yeah , just a blank sheet .
B :  Okay .
C :  Well I was gonna draw a cat too , so . I'll just try something else . Something different than Garfield .
A :  No .
C :  Mine is a bit more skinny .
A :  Yeah , it's pretty skinny cat .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But uh
D :  And the most interesting tail .
A :  Is your cat , or did you find him on the street ?
C :  Well , it's supposed to be a cat . I like cats because uh
C :  they are uh
C :  independent .
A :  Ah .
C :  The pen .
C :  So .
A :  Okay . That's pretty clear . So everybody knows how to work with the white board now ? So if you have any ideas or if you wanna draw anything on the white board , just ask and go ahead . It's pretty uh easy .
D :  Yeah .
C :  The pen .
A :  'Kay . S haunted white board . So we've got the tool uh introduction . We
D :  We're being haunted .
A :  move along to the project finance . Um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five Euros . Our selling price . Uh our profit aim is fifty million Euros . Uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , so we have to work together to reach our aims . Uh we can do it international , so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . Um but that's all in the later stadium .
A :  Our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half Euros , so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . It won't work . So just try to remember these points . Selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . And production cost uh maximal twelve and a half Euros .
A :  So that's leads us to our little discussion . We've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . So I'm gonna sit down , I think . It's easier . I've got a message . Five minutes . Okay , that's uh good timing .
D :  Yeah , you got a message .
B :  Five minutes , okay .
D :  So just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ?
B :  Mm ?
A :  Uh maybe you have to say the magic word .
D :  Yeah . Right .
A :  Does it do anything ?
D :  No .
A :  Maybe you have to just clap it down ?
A :  Mm back up again .
A :  No slide show . Hmm .
D :  It's off now .
A :  It's off . Now you have to put it back o Oh yeah . You'll be okay , I think .
D :  Well , it was on , but
A :  Well it's those laptops .
D :  Ah , there we are .
A :  Nice . Okay . But so mm does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and I mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? Like you can use for other ? No ? You ?
B :  Mm .
B :  Oh really ?
B :  Huh .
D :  Well , we have a
C :  No , me neither .
B :  It's a
D :  kind of broad T_V_ at home , and a D_V_D_ player , so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the T_V_ , one for the video recorder , one for the D_V_D_ player . And I think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all .
A :  Ah yeah .
A :  Yep . Yeah I've I've got one at home . And you can uh program I think eight different devices in it , and you can use it for your television , anything else . And it also operates on infra-red , so you have to got the little device inside your room , and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . So that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or D_V_D_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your T_V_ on the second floor . So that's a pretty handy um
B :  Sure . Yeah .
B :  Okay , yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  Oh really .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Oh .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  thing .
A :  Um but only the
A :  I think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . It's uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  Oh .
A :  That's good to remember .
D :  So I think you can take minutes again .
A :  Yeah , that's nice , I think . So we've we want different functions
D :  Since it's your job .
D :  Yeah .
A :  uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . But I don't know if that will exceed the production costs . So that uh that's something we have to find out , I think .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah . But that would be really good if we could do that .
A :  And other functions for a remote control ?
A :  Maybe we can make it uh uh
D :  Um .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Think it has to be shock proof
B :  Sure , yeah .
A :  Shock proof .
D :  my remote control tends to fall a lot .
B :  Waterproof , or uh
A :  Sure .
D :  So
B :  Uh , you never no know uh , I w I mean uh
A :  Waterproof .
A :  Okay . So these are our um a few things we can think of . Um I will put the minutes from this meeting uh in our project folder .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Yeah , one other little thing . Thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it .
D :  So you can see
A :  That's a battery stays .
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  how much is left in the battery .
D :  But they'll also really drag up the production costs , so think we'll have to see about that too .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Uh .
D :  But maybe just a little LED , I don't know .
A :  That's an idea as well . Other ideas ?
A :  Quick ideas .
C :  Nope . They were all mentioned , so
B :  Mm .
A :  Okay . Any questions about this uh presentation ? Kick off presentation .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Um .
D :  Nope , don't think so .
A :  No ?
A :  Okay , then I'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder ,
A :  and then we can all work .
A :  Finish meeting now . Okay . And we can all work uh on our own projects .
D :  Okay .
D :  Aye sir .
A :  Okay then I'll meet you in about a half an hour , I think . So good luck .
D :  Half an hour .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Yep .
D :  Okay .
B :  Two .
C :  Good morning .
A :  Hello . Hello .
D :  Hello .
D :  Ah .
A :  You have to put it exactly on the on the yeah .
D :  Plate ?
C :  Okay .
B :  Good morning .
C :  Good morning .
C :  Should I bring my uh pen too ? Or
A :  I took your mouse . Yeah just yeah , no , that's for me , I just have to make some notes . I got my uh mouse .
C :  Okay .
D :  Uh I also forgot my mouse , but I don't need my mouse , I think .
B :  Mouse .
A :  yeah .
C :  I do .
B :  Come on . There we are .
C :  My laptop is crashing .
D :  Damn computers .
C :  Cr
C :  Help help help .
B :  Let's just check one more time .
B :  Mm .
D :  Can you hear me ? Hello ? Test . I dunno .
A :  Uh actually my laptop doesn't work , switch it on again .
D :  Check . Okay . I think it works .
A :  Oh no .
C :  Test test . Yes , it's working .
A :  So you all read what we are going to do or not ? Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm . We're gonna make a remote control .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's right .
C :  I think my laptop is a bit
C :  etchy .
A :  I just made a a simple uh presentation .
A :  So you put some things in it .
A :  Okay .
A :  How does this work ? I dunno .
B :  One uh most to the right . Yes that one . Yes .
C :  Uh p
A :  This one ?
D :  Press F_ eleven .
A :  Ah cool . Okay . So that's my name , . Uh we're going to make uh a remote control , you already know that . Just have a look , are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting . You know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting .
A :  So um the thing we have to know is you already know what we're going to do , you also read what this the things or , not yet , okay . So um , yeah , it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly that's what we're going to design . Uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . Fir the first thing is th the functional design , that's very important . We have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , it's for the f next meeting .
B :  Yes .
A :  The the second thing is the conceptual design , that's what it that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . And we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . And the third thing is uh the detailed design um and that's exa yeah , you know what it is , it's exactly how it looks and whatever . Okay so uh no , this is a these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one .
A :  And you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map . Folder , okay .
D :  Folder , yes .
A :  So no okay have a look at that one .
A :  Okay .
A :  So uh what we're going to do first is um
A :  so you can read . You have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard and um and say why it's your favourite animal . So and you have this is just to try it out and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen .
A :  So okay , so first have to show you , maybe you can come here to have a look how it works .
A :  Yes ? Okay . This a new page , it's okay . Use pen format .
D :  Ah I can see it now .
B :  Yeah .
A :  and a different colour can use here no I just take the pink .
A :  You take oh there's no pink , okay , oh just purple , okay . No blue . And uh line width ten . Okay uh just take what I'm going to draw is an elephant .
B :  Purple .
A :  Just draw slowly , because otherwise it won't work .
A :  It's a very
A :  nice elephant , you can see .
A :  I dunno what it looks but it doesn't matter .
B :  Looks very nice .
A :  I just h
A :  Something like this ? Oh no
D :  It look like a dinosaurs .
A :  Yeah , okay . Because I like uh okay .
B :  A pink elephant .
A :  Just takes so long , okay . Whatever , just .
A :  You erased this one .
A :  It's a bit slow you can see , this is a bit annoying .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay , so just
A :  for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want .
D :  Let me try one .
A :  Just don't um yeah , just u use it like that , yeah . That's okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm . Okay and then uh what's the colour ? How do I do
A :  It's in format .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Ah .
D :  I'll take this one .
D :  Uh there has to be water , but
A :  Just
A :  No it has to be an animal , so if that's it's it should be a shna snake or something . Okay . Okay okay . Okay .
D :  Yeah yeah , but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water . So I first uh draw the water .
C :  Okay .
B :  The water is important .
D :  Uh . Okay , and now
D :  I make the animal .
D :  It's a fish .
C :  Wow .
A :  Okay , cool .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So .
D :  Um
D :  This is a worm .
B : 
A :  Hmm yeah , that's nice .
C :  Wow .
D :  Okay , who next ? Uh
A :  Uh do you have to write down why uh that doesn't matter , just it's to get used to the whiteboard , but it's okay . Just make a new blank new blank page .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well Paul ?
B :  Yeah . Like this ?
A :  Yeah , not too far to the to the t pen top .
B :  Okay . Um
B :  let's make it
B :  a dog .
B :  Ooh .
A :  Maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , so that no , to the yeah .
D :  I think it's a pig .
B :  Ah okay .
B :  A pig ?
B :  I can make a dog .
A :  No , it's a dog .
D :  Or a dog .
B :  Um
D :  A sheep ?
A :  Uh we d only have twenty five minutes , so .
C :  Take it easy .
B :  'Kay , I make a cat of it .
C :  I I was gonna make a cat too .
A :  Use your fantasy .
B :  Oh , not too quick .
A :  Just hold it more more to the back then you don't have okay .
B :  No I have it .
B :  I just draw too quick I think .
B :  Okay , that's it .
B :  More .
A :  No , that's okay , thank you .
B :  It's just to get used to it .
C :  Okay .
A :  I thought these pens would be just um uh you write it down and you download it to Word , you already did it or no ? No , not yet , okay . But it's just
D :  No .
B :  Yeah , that's right , it but you actually got to write on the paper . You really got to write on that paper .
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Yeah , I know , but I d I I thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in Word , so that's not just it's just a picture . So it's not that cool as I th thought it would be .
D :  Yeah yeah , it's a real pen .
B :  Yeah , but it's just a picture .
D :  Oh .
B :  You really
D :  Y you can you can't edit in the edit it in Word .
B :  No .
A :  No .
D :  Oh , okay .
B :  It's a donkey .
A :  I don't know , what time did we start this meeting , I'm not sure .
B :  Uh I think it was uh
A :  Half past .
D :  Half past ten .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  Brilliant .
A :  Okay , perfect .
C :  Nice , eh ?
D :  Yep .
A :  Yeah , thank you . Now we just have to save everything , so .
A :  Oh this is definitely the best one .
C :  Uh .
A :  Okay , so
A :  uh what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five Euros .
C :  Excuse me .
A :  Okay , that's . And uh we have to make a profit of fifty million Euros , so we have to uh use a big market in Europe .
B :  Piece of cake .
A :  The production cost are about half the price of selling price , sorry .
B :  Uh easy .
A :  So can someone make a
A :  a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , I dunno . Uh so we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything , so just have a look how it we think about remote controls .
D :  Yeah , my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ?
A :  Oh yeah , that's a good question .
D :  Because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart .
A :  I think it's I'm not I'm not sure , it's not mm I think
D :  So I
C :  Yeah , it probably would be universal .
B :  Universal . And only television ? Or more devices ?
D :  Because
A :  I don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five Euros , so not sure , but
C :  Hmm , maybe , I don't know .
D :  Yeah , I know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh Euros
A :  Okay , so we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . Okay , perfect .
D :  Yeah , I think .
B :  Ah okay .
C :  And uh also for the V_C_R_ and uh D_V_D_ player and okay .
A :  Yeah , everything just so a lot of buttons on the remote control .
C :  Yeah , probably .
B :  Not just a T_V_ .
A :  No , just everything .
B :  Okay .
A :  . so yeah , what what what's a remote control , it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , it's not nothing very special , but um yeah , that's right .
D :  Okay .
B :  Well we can try to make it special .
A :  So do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability or user
B :  Well
D :  Well I th I thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , so uh that's no matter . Um if we uh control the V_C_R_ and the D_V_D_ player player with it
D :  uh it has to be clear , because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , so uh it's not only for the uh technical persons .
D :  I think it must be a very good control , so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room , the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality .
A :  Hmm yeah .
A :  That's right . Should be a good point .
B :  Yeah . Nothing
C :  Okay .
C :  And how big should it be ?
D :  No . Yeah . I dunno um
B :  It shouldn't be too big , but I don't think we can make it too small , 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , so .
C :  Yeah .
B :  We can't make it smaller than the things we see now I think .
A :  Just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it .
B :  Yeah . Or we have to make something uh
B :  like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . Maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer ,
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  maybe more trendy .
A :  But you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open . Okay , yeah , that's cool . Maybe for the D_V_D_ pla player or something , if you just okay .
B :  Fold open , where you can see uh more options . I think
D :  Ah that's that's
C :  Yeah n
B :  Yeah , something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and T_V_ channels and inside things you don't use that often .
D :  Ah right right .
C :  Yeah , or you c
A :  Yeah .
D :  Oh that's good , yeah .
C :  O or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control .
B :  Yeah b I wanted
D :  Yeah .
A :  Why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? There are buttons on it .
C :  Uh maybe be uh it's it's
B :  No you can make an uh manual in it .
C :  Yeah , or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , but
A :  But it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it .
C :  Uh like a a to have Yeah , maybe it would .
B :  But that's Yeah , I think it's much uh too expensive .
D :  Yeah but it's not reachable I think , touch screen . And we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So . And if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile .
B :  Yeah , too fragile .
D :  Yeah and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it and touchscreen is not uh kids uh
A :  No .
A :  You can put games on your remote control . Whatever .
C :  Kid-proof .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And uh how about the batteries ? Uh should you put it in a recharger or a just
D :  Um
A :  Oh maybe that's a good idea , just to put it on your television and just s recharge , you never have to use any batteries .
D :  Ma maybe a home station .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm yeah .
B :  Maybe that's a good idea , but yeah , we have to look at the price now I think .
A :  Yeah , how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I dunno .
B :  Well uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ?
A :  I dunno .
C :  Yeah , if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive , but I don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing .
D :  Ah yeah .
B :  Maybe have uh
A :  Uh if you th look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , because maybe it's too expensive .
B :  Yeah , 'cause well
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but a home station is uh a really good idea , because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is , and now you can put it always at the same place . Maybe it's
A :  Yeah , that's right , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Therefore it's a good idea , but maybe it's expensive .
B :  Maybe uh use it as a separate option . Sell it uh separately .
D :  Yeah .
D :  You can yeah , you can buy it with it .
C :  Yeah , but I have a mouse that's uh uh also uh
B :  Rechargeable .
C :  Yeah , and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , or you can change your batteries , so .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah .
A :  The option , just the option , that's cool .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Uh I I set something on paper already , size , looks , uh usable , uh the buttons on usable places , uh the the on off button must be on top , uh it has to lay good in the hand , you you have to uh
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Has it be has does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control or
D :  Yeah , I don't I don't know I don't know if we
B :  Well I think we have to look at that , 'cause well you can do the standard way , but then you won't
D :  You can make it very special , to create our own um looks , but it's very hard to
C :  N uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works .
D :  Nah .
B :  Well you can um
B :  have uh the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the T_V_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see . But the rest is uh you don't use that often , so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . So it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control I think , so you can do something unique with that .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  And what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , when you have it closed , you can still uh do the th the functions . Yeah . But n yeah , but uh i basically when I'm watching T_V_ I'm just using like five buttons or so , so .
D :  Yeah yeah , what Paul already said . Uh on on top are the the basic options on top , and if you fold it open
A :  Yeah , just for the T_V_ and just the normal function , that's fine .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  But maybe it's
B :  Yeah . That's what I meant .
A :  maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh what's it's called ?
D :  Mm . If you if if you make to fold open it's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control .
A :  Maybe it's hard t
B :  Uh
A :  No , that's right . So maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control .
B :  Okay , but yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Just think about it . We have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , so . There's some more things . We have uh another thirty minutes , so then we're going to meet again . So you know what you have to what you have to do ?
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Um for m for me uh the Marketing Expert , the user requirements uh specification , do I need to think as a user , a as a a a only the looks and the
B :  No , what you want to do with it .
A :  Yeah , I think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a T_V_ , a D_V_D_ player , all that things . Also from a user , but all these things together . Yeah , everything .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , it's also about strength and uh for everything uh .
B :  Yeah , I also wrote down some stuff that you want on a
A :  Yeah , no maybe not not uh , that's not a f that's something for for for yeah . That's not for you .
B :  Technical fun fu
D :  Okay .
A :  Just if what's in the market , what's normal , uh what kind of uh buttons do you have .
B :  What do you want to do with your remote control , what do you need on your remote control . I already wrote some down , some ideas .
A :  Yeah , it's alright .
D :  Yep .
A :  Yeah , just is that okay ?
D :  Okay .
B :  Yep .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  There's already a document in the
B :  folder about it .
D :  Yeah , me too .
A :  So see you in thirty minutes .
D :  Okay , well done .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  For the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so your laptop .
B :  I will .
D :  Oh Paul .
B :  It didn't say that .
A :  No , sorry .
B :  Your fault .
D :  Ciao .
D :  Bye bye .
B :  Bye bye .
A :  Good morning .
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Yeah , busy job .
A :  Good morning .
A :  So
A :  Oh , good morning everyone .
C :  Good morning .
B :  Good morning .
A :  I'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting .
A :  I've prepared a little presentation .
A :  My name is and uh I hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes , as will I . Um I'm the Project Manager of this project , and uh , well I will tell you on what actually is the project . This is uh the agenda for our first meeting . Um this is the opening , then we will get I will hope we will get acquainted to each other . We'll do a little tool training with these two things . We'll take a look at the project plan .
A :  Uh there will be time for discussion . Actually we have to discuss because we have to create a product . And then we will close this session . Um but first of all we I'd like to uh introduce you to this room . Um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table . Um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field so the little cameras can see your face . Um there are cameras
A :  everywhere around the room especially here for your face , of course , and this isn't a pie , it's a a set of microphones and there are microphones here also . But please uh don't be afraid of them .
A :  They won't hurt you . Um well uh I said I'm the Project Manager and uh I'm hoping uh for a good project and uh I'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project . Let's start with the ladies .
B :  Well
B :  Well uh I'm uh and my uh function is User Interface Design ,
B :  I think . So uh that's me .
C :  Okay , uh I'm uh I'm the Industrial Designer and I uh hope to uh look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project .
A :  Okay , so I .
B :  Me too .
D :  My name's . I'm uh Marketing Expert . My job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers . So I also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other .
A :  Okay , well we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company . That's good . Um well I said uh we're working on a project and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control which uh has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly . And uh I hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a product .
A :  Um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods . It consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . As you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting where we will discuss uh our work so far . Okay . But first I will uh tell you something about the tools we have here . I already talked about the cameras and microphones , but they are not of uh much use to us . Uh
A :  we will have to take advantage of these two things . They are smart boards . As you can see , you can give a presentation on them . And uh this one here is a white board . I will uh instruct you about that soon . Um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room .
A :  Um and yeah there are available on both smart boards but I think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . As you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here . Um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page , um uh to go back and forward between pages , and of course uh to save it every now and then . Um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance
A :  like this if everything's okay , but I first have to put it on the pen , you see I'm new to it too . Um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want . As you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , it's not such a fast board , it's a smart board but also a slow board . Uh but you can write things and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things , so we have uh est left . And um you can also delete an entire page , but we ask you not to do that . Just simply create a new one and uh start all over because we want to save all the results . Um does everyone understand this
B :  Oh .
B :  So we can't erase anything .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  nice application ? Well you can erase it with the eraser , but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page , but just create a new blank one . I will delete this one now because we don't use it yet .
B :  Right .
B :  Alright .
A :  But you can of course erase when you make a mistake , but don't uh delete entire pages . And you can also um let's see I think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen , for instance take a blue one and uh change the line width like to five . Um that's what you will need for our first exercise , because I'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal .
A :  It's also to gets to know each other because um I'm asking three things , uh for that uh drawing , to do it on a blank sheet , with different colours and I just showed you how to pick a colour , and also with different pen widths which I also showed you . Um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word . Well I'm not very good at drawing , but I will uh go first
C :  Okay .
A :  and um try to draw
A :  Or maybe you should guess what I'm drawing , eh .
D :  Good .
C :  Hmm .
D :  No .
B :  It's a sheep .
D :  Dinos Dinosaur .
C :  Seal , a seal .
D :  Beaver .
B :  A beaver .
C :  A be
A :  Well it uh
B :  It's weird .
A :  could be everything .
C :  Mm . With a tail and a mouth .
A :  Maybe when I put on
B :  It has wings ?
D :  Turtle .
A :  this thing
A :  it could be a turtle , or a snail , and
C :  Snail .
B :  Well the snail doesn't have legs .
C :  Okay .
A :  But a turtle has . And those are slow .
A :  And I hope our project group will not be slow , but we will uh work to a good result and do it uh as fast as we can . Okay , time for another animal . Would you like to go next ?
D :  No problem . No problem . Mm . It was four months ?
C :  Sure .
B :  Oh right .
D :  Nice , okay .
B :  Well .
C :  The hell .
D :  To make it a little bit easier .
B :  It's a giraffe .
C :  Make that cute .
B :  Or a dinosaur .
D :  No , it's a giraffe .
D :  'Kay . I think it's
D :  easy to r uh to
D :  recognise as a giraffe . Yeah , the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , it can reach everything . And I hope I can also reach a lot with this project . So that's my favourite animal .
B :  Yes . Giraffe .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . Could you write the words , uh underneath it ?
D :  Anything else you need to know ?
D :  Oh , uh
A :  Or more words .
C :  Tall .
D :  Tall .
D :  So , 'kay .
B :  Should I uh
B :  Alright .
B :  So I can draw , but uh
B :  Uh .
B :  Well .
B :  Oh .
C :  B
D :  It's a mouse .
C :  Bunny rabbit .
D :  A bunny rabbit .
B :  Oh wrong one .
B :  Uh .
B :  Well uh you can guess what it is , I hope .
D :  Uh-huh . No problem .
B :  It's a rabbit . And uh well uh it's uh quick , I guess .
A :  Little rabbits .
B :  That's uh my uh favourite animal .
A :  Okay , thank you .
C :  Okay .
A :  And our final drawing .
D :  Bob Ross .
B :  A dolphin .
D :  Dolphin .
C :  Okay , um .
C :  Uh I uh draw I I've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence . One of the most intelligent uh
B :  Right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  animals in our world .
B :  Well .
C :  Yeah intelligent . I've I've uh Eraser .
B :  With an E_ .
B :  You can try out the eraser now .
C :  Pen .
C :  Well not perfect , but okay .
A :  Okay , well thank you very much . I can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group , huh ?
B :  Not really .
A :  Well , nice animals , nice words . Sounds good . Um back to business , back to the money part . Um from the finance department I have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five Euros . And we're hoping for a aim of fifty million Euros and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market . And the production cost will be twelve Euro fifty max .
A :  Okay , well it's time uh for some discussion . I've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about . Uh what's your experience with remote controls , um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , maybe for which market segments should we aim , or should we aim for all segments . Uh well actually I'd like to hand the word uh back to you .
A :  What's your experience with remote control ?
C :  A lot of buttons . And you always lose them . A lot of buttons which you don't use or who you don't use Complex .
B :  I always lose them . Yes .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Complex .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Not user friendly .
B :  search for the buttons , which one is which and uh
D :  No .
D :  No .
D :  Boring .
A :  Boring , it's not fun to use a remote .
D :  No . Black , all black .
C :  Mm .
B :  Well .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So , yeah .
C :  Black colours .
A :  Well maybe we should try to make it fun .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  They use batteries and batteries uh and poor signal .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh .
D :  The the angle you have to use .
B :  Perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls . Yes , perhaps you can integrate them or something .
D :  You had different remote controls for different devices . Yes .
C :  Yeah , different remote controls , yeah .
C :  Uh for the use of different uh devices .
B :  Yes .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Your stereo and your T_V_ and uh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Perhaps that's an idea .
D :  Yeah but then again you you still have a lot of buttons , so
B :  Yeah , that's right . And which you don't use .
C :  Yeah but you could uh I thin uh there's a possibility to g uh to uh
C :  to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em .
D :  Flap yeah .
B :  Right .
D :  Yeah , okay , that's possible , but it'll get very big the the remote control .
C :  That's possible , so that you only get the No n n no , just Uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday , but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in Dutch . Uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly . Or uh the numbers , of course . But uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television . You only use those uh the first time , or .
B :  Yeah . You should just give it to .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Changing channel .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm . numbers .
D :  On and off .
D :  Yeah , play , pause , stop .
C :  So . Uh .
A :  Mm-hmm . So maybe a a minimalist design , the least uh possible amount uh of buttons .
C :  Yeah , I think so , yeah .
B :  Yes .
B :  But you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . Because uh things for uh teletext , I dunno uh , w what's the name ?
D :  Mm-hmm , of course .
C :  Yeah , uh teletext . think so . Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons , but on the other hand they need many buttons so they don't have to get out of their seat .
D :  No .
B :  Yeah . But
D :  Yeah .
C :  Right .
D :  Because I think a market will be all kind of people . Elderly p el elderly , young people , so .
B :  But if if it's if it's international you should uh look in think in Britain they have uh different things they can do with the T_V_ , or so uh that you can choose what you want to see . I dunno if you should uh take that in consideration , or that you just should aim for the normal T_V_s that uh
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah I think that's the better one , because
C :  Yeah I I understand .
B :  And the B_B_C_ .
D :  I think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only Britain then I think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty , I think .
C :  No .
B :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , I don't know if the they have that anywhere else , though .
D :  I think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and Britain , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , we can leave that .
C :  When I think of it uh I think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh
D :  Not that much .
C :  to make it user friendly . So uh I think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television . So uh it only has to have uh the most used buttons . You don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television . In those in that
D :  Mm . Standard deliver .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Well but but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search . That's not
D :  No but
D :  Yeah . Yeah , th it it's I think that's not
C :  Yeah but I but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control . It's impossible . Because uh for example Sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . Uh
B :  Yeah , that's right .
D :  Yeah , okay .
D :  No .
B :  Yeah that's uh .
D :  I think n m n most televisions nowadays do this .
C :  Yeah , but uh they don't use the same signal , uh on remote control . Because you can't use a Panasonic uh remote control on a on a Philips television .
B :  Well not everywhere .
D :  So I think numerals .
D :  Yeah , but then you have to choose the this always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . You can use which which type of television you have . That's no problem . But I think like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that's that's nowadays standard , I think .
B :  Yeah , you can choose the code .
C :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay , but uh I think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because because uh the first they lost the one they lost first one or the first one is broken , so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television , so that option is not uh optional for those uh people .
D :  Simplicity .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah g available .
B :  But the people have a new television , and c if you look into the future , then they want will want the button , if their thing is broke .
D :  True .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So we should take that in consideration .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , well any more ideas ?
C :  Oh mm , no . Things'll come up .
D :  Of course .
B :  Guess not .
A :  No ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , yeah well we have some time . Let's see what more I have to tell you . I don't think there is much left . Nope . We're starting to close . Um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes . In the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions .
A :  Um , as you can see , the different roles have uh different tasks .
A :  And there's a ping . Is it my laptop ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
C :  Stop the meeting now .
A :  Ah well that's good , five minutes and uh the meeting's over , uh right on schedule . Um the Marketing Expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification . The User Interface Designer will work out the technical functions design . And this was the Interface Designer ? Or the Interaction Designer . Or what was it , I_D_ ? Interface Designer , okay , first guess was right . Uh will take a look at the the working design .
B :  Yeah meeting will close in five minutes .
C :  Okay .
B :  Hmm hmm . No interface .
C :  Mm . No ?
D :  Interface .
C :  No , the Industrial Designer will take a look at the working design , and the in uh usability interaction Yeah , okay . Okay .
B :  No the Yeah .
A :  Industrial Designer , okay , sorry .
A :  Let's just use the acronyms . Um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach .
B :  So
B :  So I should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote , or uh , or how I don't really
A :  Uh well those instructions will be uh in the email you will receive uh shortly , I hope .
B :  Right . Alright .
B :  Me too .
A :  And of course you have your own uh expertise . Well uh that was what I had to say . Uh are there any more questions ?
D :  Uh-huh .
C :  Okay .
D :  No .
C :  No .
A :  No ? Okay well I think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working .
D :  I have one question . Where does it says we have to make a remote , because I presumed
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , one question ?
C :  Oh .
D :  She didn't know who .
D :  Okay , no , no problem .
C :  No problem . Okay .
A :  Okay we're still going . Okay , well I expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly . Okay well uh see you all in about thirty minutes , then . Thank you very much .
D :  No problem . Yeah .
B :  Alright .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Alrighty . Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C : 
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm uh .
D :  We're the first .
B :  Mm .
B :  We're the first ones .
D :  Marketing Expert , yes .
A :  Mm .
A :  So you found your spots .
D :  Yes .
B :  Move to the meeting room . Okay .
D :  Bling bling . Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh where has my screen gone ?
C :  Hi .
B :  Hello , good day . Yep .
C :  Oh yeah , we have to talk in English , huh .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah . My screen is gone . Oh .
A :  It's called black .
B :  Kick-off meeting , wow .
B :  It's uh looks uh nice .
C :  I'm afraid I'm a bit slow for this stuff uh .
B :  Hmm ?
A :  Okay .
C :  I'm afraid I'm a bit too slow . I don't know how much preparation you guys did , but not a lot .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  No , it's it was uh not enough .
A :  You see this beautiful presentation . Okay let's get started .
D :  Yeah . Very nice .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh I sort of prepared this . Uh opening acquaintance , tool training , uh how to use the things here . Uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting . Um we're supposed to develop a new remote control , that's both original , trendy and user-friendly .
D :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So , hope you have good ideas . I don't . Um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . Uh functional design , then we do some in individual work , then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera .
B :  I did my best .
C :  Not yet .
A :  And at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up .
A :  Uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . Um
A :  uh we should take some practice . I have some instructions now to do that . Uh well you know how to the documents work . So
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh this for toolbar . You see it next . Um
A :  we have a pen . And we can use this pen to perform . Yes . So
C :  Operations .
A :  It doesn't always work .
A :  Yes . Okay so you can
D :  Yeah .
A :  draw .
D :  Draw . Alright .
A :  Okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . Okay ?
D :  'Kay .
A :  Uh
A :  Okay . Each of you can uh take some practice and you should draw an animal .
A :  Uh you should explain
A :  Uh with different colours and with different pen widths . And you should explain why you draw that particular animal . So , Julian .
B :  Okay .
D :  Don't take up too much space .
B :  Um yeah .
C :  Different pen widths , how do you do that ?
A :  Uh with the format menu .
C :  Oh okay .
A :  And use different colours etcetera .
B :  It's a giraffe . Yeah .
C :  Are you serious ?
A :  And what's that supposed to be ?
D :  Should it be one
A :  Oh yeah . Oh yeah four legs . Uh-huh .
B :  Okay .
D :  Giraffe's yellow .
B :  Uh it needs some uh some yellow uh
B :  Oh format .
D :  Can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? Or so y you must save it at the end and then
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah you can press the next button , which is uh yeah . I'll show you . Yeah . In file menu .
B :  That's some spots .
C :  I in the file option menu .
D :  Okay , then m make a new one .
B :  No .
C :  How much time do we have to draw anyway ? 'Cause I can take forever on this .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Do I have to explain uh why I chose this uh this animal ?
A :  Yeah . What is it ?
B :  I think it's a it's a great animal . It's a it's a giraffe .
A :  A giraffe okay . Yeah I see a long neck but
B :  Yeah , that's a
D :  It's more like a dinosaur .
B :  Um
B :  Okay I'll will give it an uh an eye .
A :  Okay . That's nice of you .
D :  Uh .
B :  Hey . Come on .
D :  Some leaf to eat .
B : 
A :  Okay . Yeah pretty good . Uh could you press the next uh
B :  The next ? Yes .
A :  Okay . Then uh .
D :  Yeah . Thanks .
B :  Here you go . Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ?
A :  Yeah sorry , introduction and get acquainted and
D :  Uh
C :  Alright .
A :  That's the idea , so
C :  Uh . Your line broke .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Alright . It's not that fast . Yeah .
A :  Yeah it's a bit slow , so
A :  Yeah .
D :  I see . It misses the spot .
A :  pressure .
C :  I'm guessing a turtle .
C :  No . I'm kidding .
D :  I say good guess .
D :  Uh
A :  Why a turtle ?
C :  Because of its shell .
D :  Because it's slow . Yeah I was a bit slow too . So
A :  It's slow . You were slow too so
B :  'Cause it's so 'cause it's green .
C :  Dude you're a good drawer .
D :  Uh some other line uh width uh
C :  Do you have a turtle pet ?
D :  No .
C :  Uh okay .
D :  I dunno . Does it have legs ? Yeah ?
C :  Yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah sure . Yeah not exactly legs but
C :  Stumpy stuff .
A :  More like fins or
D :  It's more like a tank .
D :  Yeah that's fins but I don't know where .
C :  They kind of l look like mole legs . With sharp nails on .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Some spots .
D :  Ah some eye .
A :  Yeah it's l looks very friendly .
D :  Yeah that's a fr friendly turtle I guess .
D :  Yeah well I think it's uh fair enough .
A :  Yeah okay .
C :  A little tail maybe .
A : 
D :  Right . I don't know what the position is .
D :  Does it have ears ?
C :  Uh no .
A :  No .
D :  No . Oh okay . Can you erase ears or Yeah ?
B :  No .
C :  The little holes maybe .
A :  Yeah yeah yeah . There's a a gum , gum to .
D :  Alright . Eraser .
C :  And why did you choose this animal ?
D :  So
D :  I dunno . I it just came into my mind . So there's no particular reason I pen .
A :  He said it was slow .
C :  Alright .
A :  I like it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well I'm guess I'm done . That's my turtle .
A :  Okay .
C :  Alright .
A :  Your turn Niels .
D :  How to select the next or here .
A :  The next yeah .
D :  Yeah . Here you go .
C :  Colours were under format right ? Let's see . How am I gonna do this ? Um
A :  Makes new paper .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Orange .
C :  Mm uh .
B :  A rabbit I think . Kangaroo .
A :  Kangaroo .
C :  Not quite actually .
B :  Fox .
D :  A fox yeah . Firefox .
A :  Dog .
C :  No . Aye .
A :  Cat .
C :  It's a cat . Not quite yet through .
A :  It's a cat .
B :  Mm .
D :  A cat who had an accident or
A :  Why a cat ?
C :  Uh yeah I dunno . They're my favourite pets .
A :  You have some uh ?
C :  Uh I have colour already .
C :  Yeah I'm not so good at drawing with this kind of st Oh shit . Um
A :  The pen , yeah .
C :  Excuse my language .
A :  Sure .
C :  I don't know how to draw its face . But you get the idea . It's a cat . It's my favourite uh pet animal , 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , I dunno . That's it . Or do I need to use more colours and
A :  Yeah . Alright .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think it's okay . You get idea right ? Okay um we have a financial aspect to this project . Um we can sell them at twenty five Euros . Uh
C :  Alright . Yeah .
A :  the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million Euros . Uh that's quite a big amount of money .
A :  And the production cost should be the half of the selling price .
C :  So we have to s
A :  Okay now it's time for some discussion .
A : 
B :  Okay . What uh what uh do you want to discuss ?
A :  Uh
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . We should get started .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
A :  Uh I'm taking notes . Um
D :  Okay . Great .
A :  we each have a specific task , as I saw in my mail . I didn't know if you received the same mail . Yeah ? Okay so the um uh this industrati Industrial Designer should produce a working design . Am I correct ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I guess so . Yeah .
C :  True .
A :  Okay . Uh the User Interface Designer should specify the technical functions .
A :  Right ? Yeah ? And the Marketing uh Expert should come up with user requirements . Uh did any of you already do some work on this part or
B :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well I started making an overview for myself , um what I had to do , 'cause we have three design steps and in every step I have a s specific task to perform or whatever . So I had to uh , I dunno , make an overview for myself about what I have to do , and kind of let it work in to get ideas about
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . And do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ?
C :  well how I have to fill it . Well I started I started with the first phase , I think was the functional . And uh let's see I had to focus on the working design , which you said . How does the apparatus work ? And well I basically had two points .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh according to the coffee uh machine example , I have batteries to supply energy , and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the T_V_ . And that's basically all I have so far .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
A :  Yeah I got another point . It uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the T_V_ apparatus or stereo .
B :  Yeah . Wireless uh huh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So that's very common .
B :  Uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . You d you already told that . And for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume .
C :  Yeah .
B :  That are the the basic options for a remote control .
C :  Yeah I kept it global 'cause that it activates or deactivates specific functions , 'cause I wasn't thinking yet about that . I mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel but you might wanna use teletext also . I dunno what the word is in English . Uh
B :  Okay , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Same I believe .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh and what did the Marketing Expert do ?
D :  Uh well from a marketing uh perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . Um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? So there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . I mean , what functions do they have . Um especially what are their shortcomings ? Are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um therefore we have to to do some internet search . For example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? So we can see uh what needs to be supported .
A :  Yep .
A :  Yes .
D :  Um and we can interview current users and future users . What w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? Um especially for future users , uh I'm thinking of early adopters , because they they use new technology first , and they play with a lot of tools and stuff so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . And you can get that information ?
D :  I think I can get that information , yeah .
A :  Okay . That would be very handy . Um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ?
D :  So yeah .
D :  No n not specifically . More to how to get them and
A :  No ?
B :  I got some uh requirements it has uh it has to be user-friendly . Uh really easy to use buttons , not not uh very small buttons , but not the the also the big big buttons , but just normal buttons . It has to be a small unit . It has to be uh yeah , you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . So it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine .
A :  No okay .
A :  Yeah ?
D :  Yeah ?
A :  Of course .
C :  Yeah . Obviously .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Big , mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Uh and a and a good uh zapping range .
A :  Uh what do you mean by that ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance . It has to be capable for zapping uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  From the other end of the room or something ? Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay um
A :  Well I don't think I have anything more to add at the moment .
A :  I think the best is to go to work .
C :  Whoa . Is that you or alright .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  Any more points to discuss ?
A :  Yeah . I think
A :  we can go ahead with what we have . I will summarise the things we discussed and put it in the project folder .
A :  Uh the use of the Industrial Designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . And it seems you get more information by email .
D :  Alright .
A :  So that was it for me .
C :  Alright .
B :  Okay .
D :  'Kay . Thanks .
A :  Uh
B :  Are you going to put the the notes on the
A :  Yeah , in the project folder . Yeah . I'm writing very fast . Hope it's readable . Okay um anything more you want to add to the discussion ?
D :  Yeah . The pro okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  Alright .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  Uh .
B :  Yep .
D :  I guess so .
C :  Well no I'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh
B :  Yeah . Do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ?
C :  session ?
A :  Yeah . Because then we have a
B :  After that we are going to the conceptual uh
A :  Yeah . Y you do some individual work , we have meeting , individual work , meeting . And at the end of the day we have a final meeting . And then I have to prepare uh I have to defend our design , so make it good . I depend on you .
D :  Yeah . We're just working the three phases .
D :  Okay . Better make it
C :  Yeah okay . We'll do our best .
B :  Okay .
C :  I am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . Do we I mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? Do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ?
A :  Yeah ? If you can mix it it's okay .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . That is my question also because like new new functions
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well I think that is the user
D :  Requirements . Yeah .
A :  requirements part . As to what they want . Uh do they want all those functions on that small
C :  Yeah . True .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But but we need good communication about this stuff , 'cause I have to f put the components into the design . So if I don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard .
D :  Unit .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I would first m
D :  Yeah well I I was
A :  Yeah I understand .
B :  Yeah . I I think we have first to start with the basic functions and we can uh expand them . Yeah .
D :  Yeah well like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which I know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . So you can switch to your video and then the same buttons control your video . And another function I'll think of switch to your media centre , because that's getting very popular . And then use your Windows media centre under your T_V_ with the same remote control . So with the switch , one single switch
A :  You can always add a few
A :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm , the C_D_ player . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah so
A :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah I I know what you mean , but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . You need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . And you you don't need that for a T_V_ . And and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , so I kind of need to know what we uh need .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah records and stuff like that .
A :  Okay .
D :  No .
A :  You need additional yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Uh
D :  Yeah .
C :  Whatever , I'll just put my ideas in uh
A :  Yeah .
C :  in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh
D :  In the project uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . We could just start with the assumption that's only for T_V_ and video . And um reserve the possibility to add other features . So we have a basic starting point and you can always extend that so make sure it's extendible . Yeah .
C :  meeting .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . So it's hasn't it's yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
A :  Th the least amount of functions possible so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . I understand . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah ? Okay and uh I'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to .
C :  Alright .
D :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , you're di dismissed . Not yet . Okay .
B :  Can we leave now or
D :  Half an hour .
C :  Thanks .
D :  You're fired . No .
C :  Alright .
B :  Mm .
D :  Alright let's move on .
A :  Let's see what we got to do .
D :  Yeah .
C :  See you later .
D :  Yeah see you later .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Good luck .
A :  Yeah . Thank you .
D :  Well good luck .
C :  What the
B :  Hi .
C :  Hi .
A :  Hello .
B :  Oh .
A :  Good morning .
C :  Morning .
B :  Good morning .
D :  Good morning .
A :  Uh before I start with the with the meeting I have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in , uh because we're uh being watched by uh Big Brother . So um Yeah . Yeah . This uh These are cameras , so are these . This thing uh that looks like a pie , are actually all microphones .
D :  By Big Brother ?
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  So you must be careful with uh with uh all this . And uh as I can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be . And that has to do with the camera settings , so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras .
D :  Of our faces .
A :  And Indeed . So they can see our faces . Okay .
A :  Welcome at the kick-off meeting . My name is uh Danny Wolfs .
A :  Uh this is the agenda for today . Uh first a little opening . Uh I will introduce myself , uh and uh I think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself .
A :  Uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . So uh we get to know each other . Uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards .
A :  Then the project plan . What we're going to do , and how we're going to do it . Uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end .
A :  Okay uh , my name is uh Danny Wolfs . I'm the Project Manager . What's your name ?
B :  I'm Juergen Toffs . I'm the User Interface Designer .
A :  User interface , okay .
C :  Hi , my name's uh . I'm the Industrial Designer .
A :  Industrial , yes .
D :  I'm uh Tim . Um my function is the Marketing Expert .
A :  Okay , thank you .
A :  First a little about the project aim . Uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . Uh maybe you have read uh read the website . It's a very uh , yeah , very uh ambitious uh company .
A :  They uh they wanna do something else . I w Uh there must be a new remote control . Uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . That's two things really uh close to each other . But at the same time uh user-friendly . And they have uh Yeah , that's uh very important uh for them .
A :  Uh there are three stages . There is a functional design . So uh what are we going uh to uh to do ? What are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? And why are we going to do it ? Then the conceptual design . How are going to do it ?
A :  And that's uh really global . Uh because at the detailed design , how , part two , uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of If it's uh it's possible technical-wise .
A :  Uh each stage is uh uh is broken up in two uh two stages , individual work and a meeting . So it's uh it's very straightforward .
A :  Okay , the tool training . We have two smart boards . This one is for the presentations , the PowerPoint presentations or the Word presentation of whatever you uh you had . Uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . So uh we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme . This is called a smart board
D :  Speaks for itself .
A :  thing uh Yeah , it speaks for itself . Um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . Not in y the the My Documents . So if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder .
A :  Uh
A :  This uh is very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . Well , I don't uh gonna explain it all , because I think you know uh how it works .
A :  Um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here , uh all must be saved . We we may not delete anything . So uh if you have uh drawn something , save it . Never delete it . That's a very important uh thing .
A :  Okay . Uh little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other .
A :  At uh the white board on the left . Every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal , and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal .
A :  Uh important is that we use different colours , and uh different pen widths . Widths . Widths . Yes ?
D :  I have a question . Um this exercise , um did the company board tell you to do it , or uh did you just make it up yourself ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  No no no . It's uh it's uh I I I must do it . Yeah , yeah , yeah . 'Cause we uh really don't know each other , and uh it's kinda new . So getting used to each other , we can uh have a little fun then , before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff . That kind of thing . Would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal ?
D :  It's part of the introduction , okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Um , yeah . I don't know really how it works . But maybe you can show us first ?
A :  Okay , okay . Yeah , okay . Drawing goes with uh this thing . Do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here . That's uh important . So hold it uh like this .
B : 
D :  You g you get electrocuted or
A :  Yeah , kinda . So , um
A :  You must p p uh push a little uh Good . Because And uh wait uh wait a few seconds . It's not uh fully real-time , so uh watch it .
B :  Ach .
A :  Oh yeah .
A :  Well I'm gonna paint in the red .
B :  Ooph .
A :  Oh . That's the background colour .
A :  Well , undo .
A :  Um
A :  The pen ?
A :  No .
A :  One minute please .
A :  Yeah , that's the one .
A :  Well , five . Okay .
A :  My favourite animal huh ?
D :  It's like Pictionary ?
A :  Yeah , you can guess what it is .
D :  The the one who says it first gets a raise .
A :  May uh paint uh next .
D :  It's a pork ?
A :  No , it's not an orc .
A :  You don't see it uh at the ears ?
D :  Mm yeah , I have it at home .
A :  You have an orc at home ?
B :  Very artistic .
A :  Thank you .
A :  So it's a cat .
D :  What's it called ?
A :  Simba . 'Cause uh we have a cat at home and he's called Simba . 'Cause he looks like the uh the the lion from The Lion King .
D :  Ah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Miniature size ?
A :  So we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion .
D :  Okay .
A :  He's happy with us , so uh
A :  he's smiling .
B :  Wow .
B :  He does have body uh
A :  No , only the face . Because we have we have twen twenty five minutes . So we uh Yeah .
B :  Huh .
D :  Okay . We have to speed up .
D :  Remember you use uh different colours , and different pen widths .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , who wants to go next ?
D :  I Okay .
A :  Yeah ?
A :  So choose a colour , choose a pen width and draw a
B :  You don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing . Or
D :  Save it .
A :  Yeah .
D :  You have to save it .
A :  Save it , okay .
D :  I've done it . New ?
D :  'Kay .
B :  You have to draw uh push hard on the pen or uh
D :  Mm uh
D :  Not really . Um
A :  Kind of firm touch .
D :  That one .
B :  Oh . Uh hmm .
D :  Yeah ?
D :  Okay .
D :  Open .
D :  Which one is it ?
D :  Smart board ? Okay . And now ?
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay , thanks .
D :  'Kay , I've speed up .
D :  'Kay , that's fine .
D :  Line width .
C :  By the way , why was your cat uh red ?
A :  Because uh my cat is red uh at home . And I have red hair , so uh must be red .
C :  Oh , okay .
B :  Oh .
C :  Oh , yeah , sure .
B :  It's a very bloody cat .
B :  It's a frog .
C :  No , it's a turtle .
B :  Uh it's an apple .
D :  It's not an apple .
C :  Must be a dog . Yeah .
B :  A dog ?
D :  Hmm .
D :  Colour .
D :  Something like this .
D :  Smaller .
B :  Huh ?
B :  Oh , it is a turtle .
A :  It is a turtle . Why a turtle ? Why ? Tim ?
D :  Um
D :  'Cause I liked Teenage Mutant Hero Turtles .
A :  You watched it a lot ? You watched it a lot ?
D :  Uh ?
B :  It's uh inside its shell . You'll be uh finished sooner .
D :  No , it's uh
A :  It's a scared turtle .
D :  No no . It's coming up .
D :  Mm .
D :  Uh .
B :  Wow .
A :  Okay , Tim . Thank you .
D :  Something like this . Okay , you know Very artistic .
A :  Jurgen , you want to go next ?
B :  Yes . Okay . Wha Thank you .
D :  Yeah ?
D :  Here you go .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  How did it work ?
A :  Format ?
B :  Performance ?
A :  And then you have the the current colour , you can change .
A :  So no red or green .
B :  And a pen ?
A :  And uh line uh width .
A :  I had five . Tim had Uh Tim , what kinda line width did you have ?
B :  Um
D :  Uh the big lines were like nine .
A :  Okay . It's a dog .
B :  Well , very good . I just uh thought I'd pick the easiest one .
C :  Uh .
A :  Okay . Why a dog ? You have a dog at home ?
B :  Well , we had a dog , a few years ago . And and it , yeah , when it died we didn't get a new one or something . But uh
D :  Uh , it's p
A :  Had a dog ? Yeah ?
A :  Ah .
D :  It's pretty good uh
A :  You have an artistic uh inner middle .
D :  An artist .
A : 
B :  Uh a Graphical User Designer , so
C :  Hmm .
B :  Hey .
D :  Think you uh picked the wrong uh function .
D :  Wrong job .
B :  Oh .
B :  No . Can work together . Ah colour .
A :  So I think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use . Not difficult at all .
B :  Well , it's okay .
A :  Okay , thank you .
D :  That's enough , thanks .
A :  Janus ? The last one ?
C :  Yeah , sure .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh thanks .
D :  I wonder .
A :  Yeah . After a cat , a turtle and a dog .
A :  I think he's gonna draw an elephant .
C :  I figure I should do something like that , but I'm gonna do something much more difficult .
A :  Uh-oh .
B :  Uh-oh . Oh , he is the artistic design .
D :  I'm gonna design a remote uh remote control animal .
B :  Remote control animal .
C :  Exactly . Uh
D :  Oh . Sorry .
B :  Well with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  That that might be easier . But at the other hand , uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , and
A :  No .
D :  I think it's easier to draw . Yeah . With a pen than with a mouse mouse .
A :  Better to draw with a with
B :  Than on the , with Yeah , I m I mean like uh like on here , drawing drawing uh . And then displaying on screen , but
D :  Mouth .
D :  Oh , okay . Yeah . W with this paper it's too mu too expensive .
A :  But what is he uh ? Is it a rabbit ?
B :  Too expensive , yeah .
C :  Yes . No .
A :  Do you have a rabbit at home ?
D :  It's a rabbit with uh broken legs ?
B :  A green rabbit .
C :  No .
A :  Is it a white rabbit f It's the white rabbit from The Matrix .
C :  Yeah , exactly .
A :  Okay , then yeah .
B :  There , the g white green rabbit .
C :  So .
B :  He's a little bit stoned there .
C :  Uh I figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh uh
D :  It will do .
C :  Uh well .
A :  Okay . Finishing touch and then we're going further .
D :  Project Manager ? Uh
A :  Yeah ?
C :  Where does the pen go ? Just uh
D :  Have you been uh counting the time ?
A :  Yeah , a little .
D :  Okay .
D :  Let's go on then .
A :  Well , I think the dog is the the most uh artistic .
C :  Uh I figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive .
A :  Don't choose for youself . That's selfish . Okay , now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff .
C :  Oh , sorry .
D :  It's pretty abstract .
A :  Uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five Euro , and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half Euro . So uh from my point of view , I don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half Euro .
A :  Uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million
A :  Euro . So that's a lot . We have to sell uh a lot of uh
B :  Yeah , how much is it ? Hundred million uh remotes or something ?
D :  Like how much ?
A :  Uh I think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . But our marketing range is uh , market range is international . So we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh
C :  Twenty million .
B :  Oh yeah .
C :  Two million , oh yeah , two million . Yeah .
A :  we can sell our r remotes to . At least that uh countries which have uh a television .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um
A :  So now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . You can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . What you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . What uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others .
A :  Um so uh let's uh let's uh discuss a little . I'm gonna join you at the table .
A :  Well what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ?
B :  Um well I think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . And my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . Uh
A :  Okay . So not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a D_V_D_ and radio and Or just only
D :  Yeah .
D :  I think so . Uh but I have some points . Can I show them on the on the big screen ? Maybe ?
A :  If you have them on uh I can uh
D :  Yeah . Yeah , I can find Uh .
A :  Okay .
A :  Oh , in case you want it
A :  This is a dead kind of fly . Between the the the , yeah , the the uh
D :  Screen ? Okay .
A :  Yeah , be The screens .
B :  Is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen ?
A :  No no no . Only All the drawings go there , at the left uh
B :  Uh but um which The ones we made on the
A :  Oh , that pen drawings . Uh no , I think uh when it is uh in Word and you have saved it in the Shared Documents folder , you can show it there . Yeah .
B :  Oh , only in Word , okay .
D :  Okay , I have some uh points from marketing point of view . Um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . Uh it's pretty cheap , twenty five Euros . Uh brand independent . Um I think , it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your T_V_ or other thing is . Um
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Five minutes . Yeah .
D :  Five minutes ? Okay , I'll wrap it up quickly . Um I personally think it has to be multi-purpose . Uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . And uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , and distinguish from uh from current products .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um maybe some other technology than infrared . Uh I rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the T_V_ then you can't switch it . Um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth .
A :  Okay . Okay .
D :  That might be a little bit uh expensive . Um
D :  And something like an L_C_D_ screen .
B :  For what purpose ?
D :  Um uh like I said here um
D :  Maybe it's easy . It's nice as an added feature feature , that um , when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the L_C_D_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or
A :  Okay .
A :  So it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh
D :  From my point of view , yeah .
A :  remote ? Yeah , it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ?
D :  Yeah , it has to be uh
D :  Yeah , our company is very uh
D :  good in making new innovative uh things .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So yeah , I I agree with you . So we must focus on things who are really uh really add something to uh to
B :  We
D :  So i i i i
D :  To the current market .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Look , you got some cheap uh remote controls there .
D :  They just uh
D :  Yeah , you got a dozen of 'em .
A :  No .
D :  But when you enter a new market with a remote control and
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  uh wanna gain market share
A :  Yeah .
D :  you have to do something special , I think .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But we have to keep an eye that it's Uh at the beginning of such a project , it's it's it's very uh cool to talk about , well , this would be cool , that would be cool . Uh but we must not uh lose uh sight of the the user uh uh friendly uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , of course . But it's But but this is just from marketing uh aspect .
B :  And and the price .
A :  Yeah okay . Yeah . Okay .
D :  I don't know anything about user interface or design .
B :  Okay .
A :  And that's because we have him .
C :  And and him .
B :  And him .
A :  Okay , uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . So uh you uh will have uh individual actions where I presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . Um the the the Industrial uh Designer has to uh look at the working design .
A :  Uh the User Interface Designer has to look at the technical functions . So that's the thing we uh discussed . Yeah ?
B :  Yeah . Um one thing uh , we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . Do we Are we going to use um it it for multiple systems ? Or uh We should have some agreement on that before we
A :  Okay . Um wha
D :  Mm uh I I don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . Uh
C :  I figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually .
D :  I think th that's a pha Yeah . That's a phase further . Ju just uh
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . And and then we can plan
B :  Ah okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  We can plan further , I think .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , you are working on the technical functions , we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh How do you call it ? Uh
B :  Consensus on the , what we're gonna do .
A :  Uh a little plan on on what we're going to do . So you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all .
A :  Some basic things we co we want to going to do . Uh I think that's well uh Yeah .
A :  Will come in handy .
D :  Mm yeah .
D :  I don't know . You decide . You're the Project Manager .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  W He says
B :  Well yeah , if the technical functions have to be designed , I I've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . Or do we use it a text screen ? Or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well , th that's that's really a step further . But if you say uh is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh tha that's a same step further .
C :  Yeah , actually it is .
A :  Why ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Why ?
C :  Then looking at individual components , so that's actually a f step further .
D :  Uh .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Like we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . And then in the next meeting we decide
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , we can take it from there . Yeah , I agree uh , we can take it from there .
D :  w what it's gonna be . A
A :  Okay .
D :  And then you s then you can delete uh
C :  Or edit .
D :  the o the obsolete uh details .
A :  Okay .
A :  So uh each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . And uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting .
D :  I think .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I must finish off now , so it's over . You uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach . And I see you in uh thirty minutes . Thank you .
C :  Okay , cheers .
B :  Okay .
B :  Sorry .
A :  Be careful .
D :  Damn .
B :  Yes .
D :  Success ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  No . Come up .
D :  Hello .
D :  Dang it .
A :  And then you have to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot .
D :  Alright .
A :  It's important to place your laptop exactly on the marked spot over here .
B :  Okay .
B :  No , that's okay .
B :  Joost , your mouse .
D :  What ?
B :  No mouse needed ?
D :  I've got a touch-pad . Do you know how how I can wake it up ?
B :  Mm .
B :  A touch-pad ?
D :  No , my laptop .
B :  Slap it .
D :  You with your brilliant ideas . I don't know if I can touch the power button .
D :  Do you know how how I can wake it up ?
B :  Is
A :  No . Yeah . Try the power button .
D :  Oh .
D :  Come on , move it .
B :  Um
D :  Now , wake up , bitch .
A :  Huh .
B :  F_ five .
B :  F_ five .
C :  I've lost my screen . Uh
D :  Yeah , so did I . I closed it . That wasn that wasn't very smart , I guess . Come on . Get back to me .
B :  I don't .
D :  Yes .
C :  Yes .
C :  I closed the
D :  I closed it .
B :  You've got your name .
A :  Yeah , my name is name .
D :  No , I didn't restart it , I just closed it .
D :  Yes .
B :  Hope it working .
D :  Alright .
C :  No .
B :  Never close your laptop .
A :  Yeah ? Everybody's ready ? Great . Well , welcome to the kick-off meeting . I uh forgot to put my name over here , it's uh it's Martin .
D :  Great . Thanks .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh , so you all know .
A :  Well , this is the agenda for today . Well , the opening is what I'm doing right now . Uh , we gonna do some acquaintance acquaintance things . Uh give some um
A :  examples of the tool training , project plan discussion and the closing . We have twenty five minutes .
A :  Okay , the project aim is to design a new remote control . Uh , some of the oje objectives are that is has to be original , trendy , and user-friendly .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  So now we all know what our
A :  goal is . Um , I oh forget I forget the whole acquaintance part , but we we all know each other . We all know each other's names . Joost , Guido , Antek .
D :  Yes .
B :  What is your name ?
C :  Yes . Antek .
B :  Antek Ahmet . And Joost .
A :  Okay . I think we uh al already uh been through that part . Okay , it consists of uh three levels of design . Uh we begin with the functional design , then we go to the conceptual design and the detailed design . Every uh level of design consists of some individual work , and we uh close it with a meeting . You all received an email with a example of our explanation of what uh the particular level of design uh means to the different uh functions , and uh you p you probably read that already , so I don't have to tell you about that .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
A :  Okay , first we're gonna um uh gonna try some different things with the tools we have over here , so you get acquainted with these uh um uh meeting tools . We have the smart-boards , uh the thes those two boards . This is the presentation boards , wh which one I'm using right now . You can uh um there's a document folder called um the sh shared document folder . You can upload your uh documents to that folder and then you can open them over here , so you can do your PowerPoint presentations on this screen . We also have the white-board . Uh , we're gonna skip through th
B :  Can we see the white-board on our laptops ? No , I saw I saw the file , the smart-board that X_B_K_ but
A :  No , no . Just on the on the screen over there .
A :  Oh , no . Probably is , but I don't know if the software is on the laptop . Is is if it's mainly a thing for in the meeting , so I don't think it's I don't know if it's important .
B :  Okay .
A :  This an explanation of the smart-boards . There is a tool-bar over here .
A :  It's quite simple . You have the the pen function , eraser function . It's like a very simple uh paint application . Uh , we well , we use the same file during uh the whole day , and uh you can make new sheets by uh by pu puttin pressing on the blank button . It works like this .
A :  Oh . If pen is selected , yes . Oh , no no .
B :  With that pen ?
A :  It's not
A :  But it is pen .
A :  It's not working like a pen yet .
B :  Mm .
A :  Huh .
A :  Huh .
B :  Mm .
A :  It's doing some stuff now . So you can use a pen . You can use an eraser .
B :  Little bit slower .
A :  And you can make new uh fi uh new blanks , and you can change uh the line width and the colour of the pen by pressing on forward , which y you have to select pen format .
A :  And then select current colour or line width .
A :  So , it's quite easy .
A :  Uh well , now you're all uh acquainted with the different tools .
A :  Right , we're gonna try out the electronic white-boards . Uh , every participant should draw his favourite animal and some of its favourite characteristics , on blank sheets with different colours , with different pen widths . Uh , I'll start off then . I'll use this uh same sheet . Alright .
A :  Oh , let me think .
A :  Different colours .
A :  Oh .
A :  Well , I'm gonna draw um a p piranha . Uh , a fish .
B :  piranha . Okay .
A :  Uh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh .
A :  I'm gonna use some different colour now . Some a little white .
A :  Looks like a fish .
A :  Think it is .
A :  Oh .
A :  Oh .
A :  Uh , colour .
A :  This is black ?
A :  I think so .
B :  Yellow
A :  Oh .
A :  Oh , this is just uh
A :  useless uh
A :  drawings but Oh teeth . I need teeth .
A :  Well , they're not supposed to be green , or whatever colour this is .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  What was uh I have su to sum up its favourite characteris Well , I like its uh sharp razor sharp teeth . Plus , uh the the big uh forehead and uh a small uh , well a small actual face . And I like its overall uh aggressive look and
B :  Different .
A :  Well , that's what I like about uh piranha . I think that's kind of what uh the intention should be .
B :  Okay .
A :  Well , who wants to be next ?
D :  Nobody , I guess .
B :  I will try . Yeah . I will try . Uh
A :  You go , Guido ? Okay .
A :  Uh , make a new sheet . Uh , it's by pressing on blank . Yep .
B :  Blank ?
B :  Okay . Then pen again ?
A :  Yep .
B :  Okay .
A :  And uh so in the format menu you can choose the different uh colours and uh pen widths .
B :  Okay , um
D :  Format .
B :  control .
B :  Uh
B :  Ah , purple .
B :  Um , I don't know what my uh favourite uh animal is , but the easiest animal I can think is is a bird . Uh I will
D :  You know , I thought of that actually . Yeah .
B :  That's my bird . Yeah ? Isn't it quite it's a little bit light .
B :  Uh , another colour maybe . A red one .
B :  A small one . Uh , line width .
B :  Two ? Three . Oh that's okay .
B :  That's another one . Ano Uh uh it's a Yeah , it's uh the most simple uh animal I know , I think . Um , I don't know . Maybe because uh there's there's some s uh free uh maybe in the sky or something like that . Maybe a little bit . Yeah . I don't know .
A :  Well , tell us something about uh your favourite characteristics of these uh particular birds .
D :  Its simplicity .
A :  Oh , okay . Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  No , uh it's clear .
B :  So more uh birds ? Okay , okay , okay .
A :  N no no .
A :  We get your point . Okay . Who wants to be next ?
D :  Yeah , whatever . I'll go next . Thanks . I haven't got a favourite animal too , so
B :  Pictionary .
D :  Oh . What should I draw ?
B :  A cow .
A :  Oh .
D :  Thank you , I'll draw a penguin .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I'll draw a penguin . Whatever .
D :  I can't draw , so
D :  you can start to laugh already .
A :  I'll do so .
D :  Whatever . Something like that .
D :  Come on .
B :  Yeah , it's little bit hard .
D :  Mm hmm hmm , orange .
B :  Orange , of course .
D :  Whatever .
D :  Oh , it's better than your bird .
B :  Uh yeah . Yeah . True .
D :  Everything's better than your bird .
D :  Whatever . Hey , it's blue . No . Whatever . Um , I like its ugliness and uh Yeah , whatever . The way it walks or whatever . Your turn .
A :  Okay .
C :  'Kay .
D :  Drawing .
C :  I'm going to draw a cat .
C :  I don't know why , but a cat is a very uh smart animal .
C :  And you can have them at home .
C :  Which is not as the case with uh with bingwings and
A :  Well , you can have a piranha at home .
C :  Ye yes , yeah .
A :  Huh .
D :  Or a line .
B :  A little bit . Yeah .
D :  I mean a bird .
B :  Don't mess with my birds , yeah .
C :  It's not very uh
C :  very good drawn , but you can see a cat from it .
D :  Hmm . It's a handicapped cat .
B :  cat .
A :  I don't think uh I don't think uh Darwin would agree with that .
C :  It's
C :  Ah , it's not scared . He's crying but
A :  .
D :  He's crying because it's ugl because of his ugliness .
A :  Okay .
A :  What do you like about it then ?
C :  Uh it's i most cats are small . You can handle them .
A :  Oh , okay . Okay . Okay . Okay , and then we are uh through the tool training , I guess .
B :  Okay .
D :  I wouldn't call it training , but
A :  Okay , this is uh something about the project finance . The selling price of our remote control is gonna be twenty five Euros . And our profit aim is fifteen million Euros . We're very ambitious on this one . The market range is international , so it's gonna be sold world-wide , and the production cost should be a maximum of twelve Euro fifty per remote control . So that's clear . Yeah ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Alright .
A :  Okay , we're now gonna discuss some stuff when well , we're gonna brainstorm about uh what kind of kemoro romo remote control it's gonna be . Uh , well tell me about your experiences with the remote controls . Do you have uh know what good experiences with remote controls ? Or do they annoy you sometimes ? Are they difficult to understand , or maybe they don't interact with different kind of uh equipment very well ?
C :  Yes .
B :  Hmm .
D :  I don't th I don't think the four of us got problems with remote controls , but if you see elderly people , all these buttons , and then they buy new T_V_ because their previous one was stolen or whatever . And then a totally different remote control with with different functions on different places , and half of the functions a are removed , or whatever . Uh , so I think what we need is is a clear uh remote control with
A :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Different .
A :  Okay .
D :  uh grouped buttons , you know . All th all the buttons which apply to the text functions in in one uh
A :  Different functions of of uh
D :  Well , one area or whatever , not like the button to enter text on top of the remote control and the button to um , yeah , to minimise it to this this or whatever o o other functions totally somewhere else . I think we should group them . And same for the for the volume buttons and the the t
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  And uh , is it gonna be a remote control that's um what it can be used for different kind of equipment , like your T_V_ and your home stereo ? Uh
D :  Well I was I was thinking uh since a T_V_ is uh mostly used together with a V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player or recorder , and not with a stereo , I think it should be good to include functions for V_C_R_s and D_V_D_ players , recorders .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But uh , the D_V_D_ players and home cinema sets often double as stereo hi-fi sets probably . It's what , from my experience .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But isn't it
D :  I don't know . Hi-fi set is uh not often used uh as I know of in combination with television .
A :  Okay .
A :  But we gonna
B :  It's only for television , I thought . Not
D :  Yes .
A :  Oh , it is only for televis
B :  I thought it was only for television . So so we probably don't have to have to uh have the functions for D_V_D_ player or V_C_R_ .
D :  Yes , it is only for television , but uh
A :  So wha what
D :  Well
A :  What wha what uh what document
D :  well we we're gonna brainstorm about that . If we think it's useful , we do it .
A :  But , where where did it uh Where did you find that ?
B :  Uh , in the email . I thought it said uh Yeah , television remote control .
A :  Oh , okay .
D :  That's right . It's a television remote control . But I was thinking since it is useful with D_V_D_
C :  Yes ,
A :  Yeah , but most television remote controls support other functions as well . So we can No , we have to think about that . Okay , uh but uh we've gonna put some a uh is is it so user-friendliness , is a is a pri priority in this case , or
C :  Yes , that's uh something extras .
B :  True . Yeah .
B :  True .
D :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , also no one's gonna buy it .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I guess .
C :  Only the experts .
B :  True .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , this the maybe is uh some aspect of the uh , or or some point at at which we can excel by making it very useful . That w Well , then you're you're the usability uh man , so this uh gonna be a very important task for you then .
B :  Oh my God .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Well , other ideas ? How can we make it trendy or something ? Do uh by just sh shape and the look of it ?
C :  Uh , to go with to go with fashion and
A :  Maybe a can opener underneath it ? I don't know . Or someth something special , like uh M_P_ three player inside of it , or uh Oh , well then the production costs are gonna be too high probably .
B :  For the bear . Uh
B :  I I uh , no I think it
D :  Yeah , way too high .
B :  Uh , I th I think yo we have to keep it simple , to get a whole market . It's international , so we have to use a standard .
D :  Yep .
A :  Okay . Maybe with different type of fronts or uh Well , m has to be something spectacular or uh one which makes it We gonna skip back to the goals probably . Uh ,
D :  Well that's an idea of course , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  original , trendly , and user-friendly Well , we al also already talked about user-friendliness . No , well something trendy and original , well that that goes hand in hand I guess . When something is original , it tends to be trendy , probably , or we should make it combination of that .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay , so you the um technical part of the process is something you're gonna look after for , so you have to think about what kind of uh equipment you want to uh , you know , you want to manage with it . Well , and that's an important part for you then , with gogors regards to the user-friendly part of it .
B :  Use friendly .
B :  Yep .
A :  Well , and you uh should look out for what makes it trendy . Well , you know , y like some special feature . Or some Does it does it gets some gadgetness or something .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yes , what the market wishes .
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , the closing . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Individual , I think so . The the Industrial Designer will w or the working design , of course , we will uh

A :  Uh
A :  Yeah well , ja well let's just start . I've uh made a presentation
D :  'Kay .
D :  Right let's see it .
A :  uh but uh I'll open it on the Smartboard , so we can all see it .
A :  So it's in the project documents because that's what we can find here .
A :  Well . Very nice .
A :  Well this is called the the the kick-off meeting . So uh I'm the Project Manager , so I had to fill it in , and uh hmm .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Oh sorry .
A :  And an uh a nice agenda .
A :  Uh we'll do the opening and then uh
A :  we'll meet each other , what uh we already do , so , that's not uh very much trouble . I'll I'll show you the
A :  the tools we have here , so that we can all use them . Then uh we'll look at the project plan from uh Real Reaction .
A :  We'll discuss about our first ideas about the project , and then uh we'll close the meeting , and then we can uh individually uh do our things and then uh we'll get back here . So this the opening we'll uh
A :  We have to uh design a new television remote control . You have heard that uh already I think , so . Um we want it to be original , so a nice uh a nice new design .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh trendy , it's also for young people , and we have to just uh make it uh modern .
A :  And uh friendly , so size does matter . And uh
A :  Well it has to be a have the the right uh the right buttons on the right place , that kin those kind of things .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Other uh
A :  There happen to be uh three stages . functional , conceptual , and d detailed design .
A :  Um so every time we we'll do some individual work , get meeting , talk about it , uh and then go into the next phase .
A :  That's just it .
A :  Um
A :  We have uh these two Smartboards .
A :  Um well as I just showed , there's a project management folder , a project document folder on the desktop . It just works exactly the same as a computer . You just uh click on the on the folder and you open the everything you you put in it with your laptop . So you can uh make uh Words Excel , everything .
A :  Um and the w the r uh the rest uh also works the same so uh when you open a notepad you uh you just get your uh things , you can uh draw . This is a uh well a drawing board .
A :  you have a these
A :  different uh functions on the board . You can see them there .
A :  So you have a a nice pen , and it's works just like a bal ball pen . This is just a .
A :  I want to uh
A :  Oh yeah . Of course w doesn't work any more .
C :  Maybe you should try to write on the on the big white uh Does it ? Yeah . It works .
A :  Yes I will eraser so .
C :  Wonderful .
A :  It's fantas fantastic . We can uh uh well you can save a file . So if uh we draw we have to save everything . Don't throw anything away .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh just we can start a new one ,
A :  and we just go on , and don't throw anything away . Just uh let them all uh stand here .
A :  We can delete , but we don't do that . Um you can here select a pen , you can draw anything you want . It's a bit uh childish you have to write . It's not as fast as you w you know it , but it does work sometimes . Well it's just like a normal uh
C :  .
A :  paint . So it's gone .
C :  Alright , yep .
A :  Well we are designers , so we have to have a a more uh a Smartboard . So that's fantastic . Um well this uh speaks for itself .
A :  We going to try it .
A :  So um we all uh are going to uh draw a nice animal on this board , not my idea . Yes our your favourite . So um I'm to going to have to draw a kangaroo , but I'm going d I'm not going to . I'm just uh going to uh well draw a nice uh
D : 
D :  Alright , your favourite animal ?
D :  Grizzly bear .
A :  beast w I dunno what I'm going to design . Oh um doesn't oh .
C :  I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your uh I hope this was part of the assignment and not uh your personal uh enjoyment .
A :  Yeah , 'kay .
A :  Hmm ?
A :  I just said it's not my idea but I am the Project Manager , and officially this is my idea . So what ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  I I I I understand . Alright .
D :  We're kinda losing time , though .
D :  We're losing time , but
A :  Ah the first the first meeting is just a bit uh loose , loosen up , a bit uh meeting each other well uh uh nice yeah . Sh
C :  so start
D :  Alright .
C :  Yep yes .
A :  I hope our Industrial Designer does this better because uh this is uh
C :  Don't uh count on it .
A :  No so a a few legs .
D :  Do we have to guess ? A hippo ? Yeah .
A :  Yes yes guess . Well I should make it an hippo now .
C :  I think it's a mouse or a rat .
A :  No I don't think so .
C :  Oh .
C :  Oh I know it .
A :  Well what is it , huh ?
C :  It's a hedgehog .
D :  I don't know how to call it . A hedgehog ?
A :  Yeah difficult English word . I didn't knew it myself .
D :  .
C :  Well I'm amazed uh about your uh drawing skills .
A :  Our characteristics sum it up . Well it's uh very uh painful those kind of thing . So we can uh just uh
C :  Yeah .
D : 
A :  We're going back and now uh our Industrial Designer can uh draw its uh most favourite animal . Huh .
C :  I am the Industrial Designer .
D :  Alright .
D :  Thank you .
C :  Chief , I am the Industrial Designer .
A :  Oh uh but this uh marketing designer .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I think
C :  It's pr it resembles the animal drawn by .
A :  what kind of animal is that then ?
D :  It's .
C :  I think can I say it ?
D :  Yeah sure .
A :  Uh it .
D :  It's a rabbit . Well
D :  Looks very nice , right ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  It looks amazing .
A :  No no no . What are you going to do ?
B :  We want to erase it .
A :  No no . No no save it and start a new uh save it
D :  Yes .
C :  These are very impor
A :  and start a new black uh doc a blank document .
C :  These are very important documents , of course , uh these drawings , uh
A :  Yeah well we have to save everything so now um the next one uh
D :  Yes uh right .
A :  and then save it and start an blank document .
D :  You go man .
B :  Thanks .
A :  Yeah . There's also different colours and different uh
A :  well pen widths uh the line the the thickness thickness . So um well you should uh try it but uh
D :  Alright .
D :  I should have made mine a white rabbit .
A :  Well y y y you could have but uh .
C :  And he deliberately draws a animal we don't know the English word for .
A :  It speaks for itself .
A :  What the uh just a duck .
C :  It looks like an uh
C :  It looks like that beast from Sesame Street .
A :  Nice .
D :  .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Big bird .
A :  Is it a duck ?
D :  You're standing in front of it , I can't see it . Alright , thank you . Yeah it's a bird , but what kind of bird ?
C :  It's it's uh
A :  Is it a plane ?
A :  It doesn't draw uh circles uh that easy uh .
C :  Do we have to uh
D :  You have to push harder .
A :  Yeah just a bit a bit childish , a bit .
B :  Mm .
C :  But we have uh do we have to name the specific species of the bird ?
D :  Release your anger .
B :  Uh no I don't . It's just a bird .
C :  No ?
A :  Well uh save the document and then uh
C :  Well wonderful .
A :  And then a a new blank document for .
A :  uh will uh choose a new colour and a new pen width so w we can all see it . No well first yeah . And then you go to format I think , and current colour you choose a new colour . And a new pen width uh also format .
B :  Here you go .
C :  Why do I have to do the difficult tasks ? Uh pen yeah that's .
C :  Uh current colour .
C :  I like uh oh they don't have pink . Oh b oh think this is uh
B :  Mm .
A :  It's not like in paint . Line width . And you can choose a nice one . Width width . With each other .
C :  Uh ? Uh
C :  Line width .
B :  Width .
C :  Uh fifteen . And I can draw ?
B :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So . Just a wa that's the way we do it's quite easy .
C :  Uh
D :  Hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Oh Pussy .
B :  It's a pussy cat .
D :  It's a cat .
C :  Oh the line width is too thick , but oh well .
A :  Well then you change it .
A :  And erase things .
C :  Uh .
A :  What ? Super pig .
D :  It's a pig .
C :  It smiles nicely .
C :  Now I have to change the line width .
C :  Uh one .
A :  So
C :  These are whiskers , you know .
A :  Yeah yeah yeah we know .
D :  Right .
C :  Uh well I think it's obvious right now .
A :  Yes alright . It's a cat .
D :  No it looks great .
C :  Miaow .
C :  Well if this isn't obvious
A :  Well well um
D :  Just save it .
C :  I'll save it alright uh save .
A :  Yeah save it and start a new blank document .
C :  Uh yeah uh blank .
A :  Yep . So that's uh what we're going to use when we uh need it . Well it's terrific , eh ?
C :  Well I feel comfortable now . Thanks for this exercise .
D :  Oh great .
D :  It's good for group spirit .
C :  I feel totally at ease .
A :  Yeah that's it . We're one big happy family now . Well then uh the serious uh stuff .
B :  It certainly is .
C :  Yeah something like that .
A :  We're we want to sell it at twenty five Euros internationally um so um but we dunno what exactly th i it is in dollars , but uh twenty five Euros .
A :  Our profit aim is , worldwide , fifty million Euros .
C :  So
A :  So I didn't uh exactly uh calculate how much we have to sell . we want to keep it our costs at twelve and a half Euros so , keep uh that in mind when we uh talk about our uh materials an f and stuff , and uh marketing uh research .
D :  Right .
C :  Alright .
A :  Now then we all uh we can uh sit down and discuss uh what do we think about our current remote controls , first about design uh about uh aim in the market
A :  etcetera ? Well uh we c we can sit down uh because uh presentation can wait . We can uh take notes and uh
D :  Right .
A :  Well who has uh some uh remarks about the current uh remote controls ?
C :  Well I I didn't have to prepare anything about uh it's not , it's it's not my task to uh talk about uh experience with current remote controls , but uh
A :  Please ?
A :  No uh I did .
A :  Well uh just w we're uh four uh if we if we would just have one then
D :  I think it's im it's important to uh look at uh the remote controls of our competitors .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Get the good points uh try to merge them into one universal remote control . On our corporate site I saw uh a new D_V_D_ player uh we're gonna produce . Maybe it's important to make it compatible with the D_V_D_ player
A :  Yeah yeah .
A :  Yep .
A :  That's alright .
A :  That would be a nice idea , yes .
D :  so you can uh use your television and your D_V_D_ player with the same uh remote control .
A :  Yep yep yep .
D :  Furthermore it's important to make it uh acceptable for the whole world , for different cultures , maybe , because we want to we want to well fifty million ?
A :  Yes fifty million is our aim to a profit , so .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah yeah so a lot of people have to be able to use it .
C :  No but uh the b the buttons have to uh have to have uh international recognisable buttons and uh
D :  So
B :  Easy to learn .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah that's right .
C :  and numbers and uh that every culture in uh , yeah , people in every country can recognise .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I'll make uh notes and then uh maybe uh well I'll put it in the project uh folder when I'm done uh just now . Well yeah ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I also think we should not add too many buttons . Modern day uh remotes have too much buttons I think .
C :  Alright .
D :  Right .
A :  No that's right .
A :  Y y you don't use uh the half of them that's that's culture uh international .
B :  Precisely .
D :  Maybe we could make one button to switch between D_V_D_ player and T_V_ and make the other buttons uh multi-functional or something .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah indeed .
A :  Yes .
C :  Yeah so it doesn't uh become too complicated with too much buttons and uh
D :  Yeah right .
A :  Yep , and maybe we do uh we even have uh more than just a D_V_D_ player . Don't we have uh other uh ou
B :  Yeah we should make it compatible perhaps with everything we use , we uh we make ?
C :  And stereo uh s uh audio installations .
A :  Uh .
A :  We also uh just uh released a T_F_T_ uh thing I saw .
D :  Yeah so but th that's kind kind of standard T_ television so it also works on that .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
B :  And I think the people who who will buy our uh remote already have some experience with remotes . So we can keep that in mind .
C :  Most people do , yeah .
A :  Well yeah .
C :  It doesn't it doesn't have to be
A :  It doesn't have to be , but we can .
B :  W well it's a n it's a new remote and you don't buy a remote if you don't have anything to uh to control with it .
A :  Well except if we deliver it together with our D_V_D_ .
D :  Yeah but
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah alright , but
D :  We need to to keep it consistent with other d uh
A :  Yeah because we look at competitors and w if we pick up the good things about that and give it a nice design
C :  Well .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah but it's it has to be useable .
C :  It has to be different and familiar at the same time .
A :  Yes .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah we could use another form or shape or colour , that kind of things .
A :  Yep .
C :  yeah the shape will will have to be recognised . I thought about uh like most uh remote controls uh are uh a long box shaped thing you can make it uh triangle shaped , but that's not uh very recognisable .
A :  Yeah .
D :  No .
B :  Well we we could make more more oval or something , and and
C :  Oval ?
A :  N we can use uh it as a as a game pad . So one hand has the beer , so the other hand uh
C :  I
B :  Yeah or so
C :  Mm .
B :  Well yeah it's new .
D :  .
D :  Not with two hands .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah , right . No
B :  but young people want something different and it is
A :  Well i we already uh one of our aims is that it has to be original and trendy so
D :  Yeah but it's quite important that it fits .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Oh but it ha it has to be m yeah . But you still have to know it's a remote and not another
B :  Yeah alright .
A :  Well there has been done a lot of researches about remotes uh we have to we can imagine uh because it's a long time uh on the market . So the the form will have been uh tested out so
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah so the long box uh shaped thing must be uh , yeah , useful
A :  Yes .
C :  or else uh they would have been ano another shape .
A :  Well for me personally I have a a lot of remotes uh at home but those ones that have a a round ending and uh well uh just an uh square uh middle I don't like to use them . I have uh have to it has to fit my hands . When it falls over it and I just have and then the button that I use most has to be here .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  It shouldn't be boxy .
C :  Yeah . Yeah a lo the long box shape yeah . You have to use one hand .
A :  It f it fits your hands and then you just push the button that you use most with thumb .
D :  Nah
D :  I don't agree with the long box uh shape it it has to be custom made for the hand .
C :  Why not ?
B :  Yeah it doesn't fit .
A :  Tho tho those new D_V_D_ players on the market do have those .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But it does fit in the hand if you hold it like this , and you can make it another shape , but then you have
D :  Yeah but if you shape it
B :  No if y if you look at new Phillips uh D_V_D_ with their uh remotes pl players they they are the new remotes aren't box shaped . They're all um
D :  If
A :  D_V_D_ players . Yes .
C :  W no w what else ? I di
D :  No that's ol old fashioned .
B :  Well
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah well but uh what what what do you suggest then ?
D :  I can imagine that us
B :  Yes uh
B :  Well most of of them are are somewhat thicker at the end , and get um yeah thinner towards the uh the other end .
D :  Well
D :  Yeah right .
D :  It fits in your palms .
C :  Hmm . Well but it's still then uh the the long box , uh but then with some uh round uh round forms in it to fit your hand , but it's it's still
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah it
D :  Hmm ?
A :  Well
A :  A it h it has it it has a that's tha th th shape that it fits your hand . That's
D :  Um .
C :  Yeah yeah al alright but but it's still it's still sort of box , yeah . It it has round forms but it in the end it's still the box , so that's what I mean .
D :  .
D :  Well
B :  Yeah yea
D :  Yeah but it has it has to fit your hand . It shouldn't be too boxy , you know . It's
C :  Yeah yeah I understand , but no no I don't mean an entire box like completely square but a also with round edges of course , but in in in at the end it's still this long
B :  Hmm .
D :  No no no .
B :  .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah it should be
C :  box shape with convenient uh round uh shapes uh
D :  Right maybe something like this or and then a button here to switch between different systems like D_V_D_ player and so you can I've
C :  to fit .
C :  Yeah yes I thought about something like that .
C :  Yeah .
C :  A big recognisable button on top or something .
D :  Yeah right , and I do think we have to keep this kind of idea
B :  Yeah .
D :  with the with the numbers and
A :  We have five minutes left . So
C :  The buttons should uh also be not too small , not too big , of course , and uh n uh uh not too close uh together .
D :  Right .
A :  Yes uh that's yep .
D :  But it should be possible to to um make it
D :  ap apparent that there are two functions for every button . So there has to be some space between the buttons . Yeah .
A :  Yep .
C :  Uh-huh .
C :  Yeah of course uh to uh to uh to have icons to explain the different functions . Yeah .
D :  Yeah right right , and maybe we should use colours .
C :  Colours , yeah .
B :  Yeah maybe we can um just like on cell phones those um well you can you can put on on them , and so you can customise your uh your own remote with different colours or or special paint jobs I dunno but
D :  Yeah .
A :  Ha .
D :  That's kinda trendy .
D :  Yeah right .
A :  Sound nice . Yes .
C :  I think we have to talk also about uh the the materials for um
B :  Well
A :  Well it's just uh about our first ideas now so I think individually we'll have to uh come up with ideas for the next meeting about these materials and markets etcetera . Yes ?
C :  .
D :  Right .
D :  But
D :  I think it's uh it's important to uh notate all the the decisions that we make , so we
C :  Already thought about something tha
A :  Yes .
A :  Well thirty minutes we have . So um
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  This is about uh what we are going to uh do uh . You'll get specific instructions when you're back in your room so uh it's uh logical uh . I think .
D :  Yeah .
B :  .
D :  No problem .
A :  Oh and uh that's uh that's all . So we'll just get a notice that the the meeting is uh over . Yeah yes say .
C :  Yeah now we can still talk about the material , we have some some minutes left uh I w wrote down uh that the case should be plastic of course , hard plastic , the buttons should be uh rubbery I think uh .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah it shouldn't be too heavy .
B :  .
C :  No n n
B :  .
A :  Well I have had remotes that um they had uh the function of the buttons was about uh uh a layer over the buttons and when I've had use it much it was gone . So it has to be made in the buttons I think . It has to uh not be loose .
B :  Yeah that's bad , yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah that's important .
C :  Mm . Alright . And of course there are several electrical cables in it to uh to connect things uh to each other .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Is there an a universal uh universal way of um transmitting from the remote to the television so it's all about uh
D :  Yeah it's univ yeah yeah yeah .
C :  I think so . It's a a common stan standard way infrared beams an infrared beam I think .
A :  It's not that in China it's different ?
D :  Yep .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But y you can have uh of course different between D_V_D_s and televisions and between
D :  And you can use
C :  It it's a we we make an a universal remote so it ha has to work with uh all kinds of brands and things .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But our T_V_s are mostly made in China and that sort of country , so
A :  Probably yes . China rules .
C :  And have well yeah I've wrote something down about how it works . The user presses a button and with an infrared beam it signals the television set accordingly , but that's pretty obvious , I think .
D :  But are
D :  Are we going w uh with the front uh fronts uh idea ?
A :  Well I think uh w we can look into that in the in the next uh thirty minutes . Yeah .
D :  I think we should make it universal and you can always use a front front on it , you know ? You can use it just plain but you can
A :  Yes .
B :  .
D :  To make it more trendy .
A :  Well j just y you get a n a normal front with it , but you can change them uh when you buy the
B :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
B :  Yes . Yes .
D :  Right .
A :  And we should uh dispatch those kind of fronts fronts a a around the world so uh
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Well you can make profit with them , and it's a way to make them trendy .
A :  Well th those fifty million don't uh don't se sells itself so we have to uh make uh some extra effort like fronts uh .
C :  Well but th but the standard front will be uh just grey or something uh b a simple colour not not very flashy .
D :  Yeah right .
B :  Yeah alright .
B :  Yeah normal .
A :  Yes . Yeah well it has to it h it has to fit the the te television and D_V_D_ set we are going to sell , so if they are uh black and black black and silver we'll make them black and silver so
B :  No a colour everyone accepts .
B :  Mm .
C :  Pink television sets pink remote , .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  standard .
D :  But people of often don't like bright colours or something . We have to make it grey or s or black .
A :  .
B :  Well young people s li
D :  Yeah but then you can use a a front .
B :  Yeah yeah , yeah .
C :  Alright .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I must not forget my pen the next time .
A :  Well if if you yeah . If you have a a a television room for little children and you make a if if you buy a a pink front they'll they'll love it . I think .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah that's right .
D :  Yeah or a t Teletubby front . Yeah yeah yeah . I will investigate .
A :  But that's uh marketing uh research you can uh you can ask uh .
A :  Yes .
A :  Well our user interface you can uh maybe uh I don't know what your specific instructions will be , but uh probably about uh the precision of the buttons and and those kind of things and what buttons will have to be on the
A :  uh remote . And you will look into the technical design and um form , I think .
C :  Mm yeah also the the look and feel uh of the the remote's also my task , yeah .
A :  Or something like that .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
B :  What's the uh url or the website 'cause I didn't
C :  Yeah I uh w was wondering that too . Y you went to the company website .
A :  Euro ? Well it it it's if you uh
B :  get
D :  It's
D :  Yeah yeah yeah just if you start up your Internet Explorer
B :  Yeah .
C :  It's the the the start uh starting page uh
B :  Oh oh right oh well I didn't uh use it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Finish meeting now . Oh alright . Well uh we're going to back uh back into our rooms so
B :  Yes .
B :  Next meeting is in
D :  Well that's great .
A :  In thirty minutes , but uh I think it will be you will be warned uh through your laptop uh to get over here . I'll have to restore my uh my desktop uh because uh it's it's the half of the normal size .
D :  Thirty minutes .
B :  Thirty minutes .
B :  Yeah alright it's it's handy to know
C :  Very handy to know .
D :  It's totally broken .
C :  Right see you in half an hour then .
A :  Oh right , oh . Ma
B :  Oh . Goodbye .
D :  Oh
A :  W that was a nice meeting .
D :  .
B :  .
C :  Right uh see you in thirty minutes then .
A :  Yeah , see you .
A :  So welcome . The first kick-off meeting . What shall we do ? First the opening , then the rest . What are we going to do . We m have to make a new remote control . It has to be original , trendy and user-friendly .
A :  So we will get back th on that . First we have to make a functional design . After that we have to make a conceptual design , and then after that a detailed design . So we'll discuss that later .
A :  First we have a look at . So first to we have to make a small painting . What have do we have to do . First you can save the documents . We have to do that every time we make something . You can print it . No . And we have to use the pen and the eraser .
A :  So Now . We all have to use this one . You have to make your own favourite animal . So I'll make an example . First don't touch that things .
D :  Yep .
A :  You can use the pen . And then you can make um
C :  Nice .
A :  something .
A :  Um you can change some things . Um format ,
A :  line , and
A :  change it .
A :  And you can change the
A :  colour .
C :  An elephant .
A :  So that's it .
A :  So
A :  So and after it you have to save it . Now we can make a new one . You have to paint now . So you're next .
D :  Okay .
D :  Oh .
C :  'Kay .
D :  Well we will try .
D :  Where it going ?
C :  .
B :  Hmm .
B :  That's uh strange .
C :  .
A :  What is going on ?
C :  pop-ups .
A :  What are you What ?
D :  Hmm .
A :  .
C :  What is this , Pictionary .
D :  Uh
A :  Um
C :  Uh a bird .
A :  Is a It is a It is a
C :  Bird .
A :  A duck .
D :  Mm .
D :  So
D :  Now save ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yes .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Now uh blank ?
A :  Blank , yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay next one .
B :  Okay . Let's try this . Uh
C :  Whoo .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Um . Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Oh .
C :  Oh not . Oh .
C :  Okay . Okay . Yeah . No problem .
C :  Shit happens .
D :  I'm not getting anything uh on my screen now .
D :  Okay .
C :  A parrot . Ish .
D :  Wow .
D :  Oh .
C :  He did it before .
B :  Uh
B :  No , no . Yeah . Okay .
D :  Nice .
C :  Oh .
A :  Very good .
B :  Uh blank .
C :  Thank you .
A :  Okay . Very good . So um you can always go back . So
A :  That's it . So that was two . Now next . The budget . The b Uh we will sell the t at twenty five Euros . And we have only twenty of twelve and a half Euro to make it .
A :  So now we have to think about what we will make . First I wanna hear from you . Uh what are your experiences with remote controls . So
C :  Uh I will start . Uh Big one , they are uh not easy to use . Um I have one set and uh a remote control , when I dropped it , uh it broke . So that won't be uh our goal , I think . And uh g big buttons , m uh that's easier to use than uh I think .
A :  F first .
B :  No .
C :  Not all the small buttons , you don't know
A :  Is this positive or negative , that uh big buttons ?
C :  Big buttons , positive . All all small buttons like when you have uh like a hundred buttons on your remote control , you won't know what they're working for .
A :  Positive .
A :  Okay . What are your experiences ?
B :  Uh well I think the the the goal of a remote control is that it's it it has an influence on the T_V_ set . And that it controls the channels and the the volume .
A :  Mm .
B :  And uh I I I think it's positive if there's a a LED uh uh a LED on the corner of the of the remote . So that you know it s it still has batteries on it in it . And that if you push the button the LED uh gives a light , and uh and you see that it's working .
B :  And uh yeah . Uh
A :  So and do they always have that ?
B :  Yeah , but
B :  No no no . But I my my experience is that it it it's convenient to have that . Yeah . Yeah .
A :  It's easy to you . Okay .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Uh at home we have a T_V_ , a video uh recorder , a D_V_D_ player , and a satellite receiver . We have uh four distinctive remote controls for that . That's not really ea easy . So it would be nice if we have one for all .
C :  Thank you .
C :  Help also . Thank you .
D :  And we also had a remote control for our radio set . But um i it it had a lot of buttons on it , and you didn't know which one was what . And it was uh uh v not easy to use . So we n barely used it .
A :  Okay so they have too much . So next . For our own remote control we have to think how do we make it . So what ideas do you have for it , for the new remote control ? What what does it have to have ?
B :  Hmm .
C :  The weight . Not not too heavy .
A :  Not too heavy .
A :  Yes .
C :  Not much buttons .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Bust-free . That when you drop it , it won't break . Like uh some kind of rubber on it . Or hard uh hard plastic .
C :  Uh buttons not too small .
C :  Uh something like when you uh lose your uh remote control , sometimes it happen . Uh it between the couch and you can't find it . When you push a but a button on the T_V_ , then you hear some uh some sort of bleep . And then you uh , hey there there's remote control .
A :  Yes .
A :  Like a phone .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So , that's .
C :  Next .
B :  Yeah well that's that are good ideas . Uh
B :  Yeah well the LED on the corner , that that indicates that it's working . If you push a button . Um
B :  Yeah .
B :  And looking on the budget , not too expensive uh material . So probably plastic or something . Uh
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah I think it uh from a marketing point of view , it also has to look nice . Or you won't sell it .
A :  Yes .
D :  And um yeah uh on our website we can see what products we already have . And it should work with as many uh as possible of them .
A :  Okay . This is It has to be compatible with other things . Okay .
D :  Yes .
C :  I have one more idea . Just popped up .
A :  Yes ?
C :  Uh it it won't take a lot of batteries . So you don't won't have to change the batteries uh once a week or uh once every two weeks .
A :  No battery use .
A :  So more ideas ?
B :  Mm no .
A :  No okay . It's only the first ideas . So uh what are we going to do now is Next meeting is in half an h hour . Uh
A :  Okay . Next meeting , half an hour . Um , what you have to do .
A :  Well look on your . And
A :  Next instructions you'll get in your email . So
A :  This is the first meeting . See you later in half an hour .
B :  Yes .
C :  Okay . Thank you .
D :  Okay .
B :  Good morning , Flores .
A :  G good morning .
B :  Marketing Expert .
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  Right .
A :  Are you ready ? You should put the laptop uh right into the square . For i for the cameras , yes . Good morning , Sebastian .
B :  For the cameras
B :  Alright .
C :  Good morning , Mister P_M_ . How are you today ? How was your business trip to Boston ?
A :  I'm fine .
A :  Um well , actually I didn't go , didn't feel like it . So Do you want to open it as read-only . Um I guess I should close it here .
B :  Geez .
B :  You have the same message of uh Windows cannot um
B :  sen oh stand-by . Close the the window .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay , the waiting is for our Marketing Expert , Ruud . Um project kick-off .
B :  So
B :  That's right . Ruud .
C :  Is there a schedule for this meeting ?
A :  Yes , there is actually . Um I will li list the agenda for today . For this meeting .
A :  Good morning , Ruud .
D :  Good morning .
A :  Uh it's important um yeah , great . It's important that the laptops are um exactly on the square , um for the cameras .
C :  I shall close the door .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Um we're here to develop uh a new product . Um I'm sure you've had a mail from our account manager about it . Um and um this is the first meeting to to generate some uh uh some ideas about it . Um you are here in a specific role . Uh Ruud is here as the Marketing Expert , Roo is here as the User Interface Designer and Sebastian is here uh in the role of Industrial Designer . Is that correct ? Okay . Um we're going to do um uh uh a little tool training uh for the tools we are going to use uh during uh the meetings we are going to have here . Um then I will tell you a little bit about my idea of the project plan , uh and we will have a discussion . Uh this meeting should take no more than twenty five minutes , so we should keep that in mind .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That's correct .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Alright .
C :  Okay . Um is there any room for a little presentation ? Uh maybe during the discussion uh section ?
A :  There is ? Yeah , there is .
C :  Okay .
A :  No problem . Um okay , this new product we are are g are going to develop , um
A :  it's a remote control , a television remote control . Um and first of all it should be original , it should be trendy and user-friendly . Those are kind of easy um uh uh goals , um and I'm sure we can find more goals for the for the product we are going to develop . Um we will discuss uh later on more ideas about uh how the remote should look and how it sh it should function and all those kind of things . The market , we should have a look at the market . Um we are going to use a a pred a project method uh during uh this development , um which consists of three different design stages .
B :  Okay .
A :  Uh the functional design , the conceptual design and the detailed design , um all of these stages um um mean that we do some individual work , prepare , and then uh meet to discuss our uh uh the the the progressions , yes . Um the first stage , the functional design um we are going to search for the user requirements , and we will um make a specific uh specification of that . Um the second is the technical functional design , um what effect should the remote have ? Well in this case control t the the television I think .
B :  Progressions .
B :  It's for the vision . Yeah .
A :  Um and the last one is the working design . How exactly does it work in the technical sense . Um the other design stages , uh we will discuss that later . So we'll kop it keep it with the functional design . Okay , um before we think about remote control we will um work with some of the tools we have uh here . Um as you see now I can give a presentation . Um it's also possible to use this one as well . You can uh uh display pr uh two presentations if you want to . Um
A :  to um presentate , to show us uh a file you'll need to uh place it in your project documents folder , which is on your desktop , at least it should be . Um then we have this electronic white-board system . Um
A :  yeah , I will show that now . Um
A :  you can draw on the board using this pen . There are little um uh sensors , so do not grab it here , but a lit more a little bit more to the uh to the end . Um
B :  Sensors .
A :  well , it it's on the um eraser now , so we click the pen button .
A :  Okay , so not too fast writing . Um
A :  you can insert a new um slide or or white-board uh uh file um by either using the insert function or by clicking the next button or the blank button . It's quite the same . Um all our um whi um uh SMARTboard um notes should be kept in the same file . So do not m make a new file . Just use this one uh during the day . Um you can use the eraser to
A :  make something go away .
B :  But we all use the same white-board file
A :  Yes .
B :  So we can work together on it while we're or should we only use it in the in the meetings ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , in the meetings , only in the meetings . It's really like like a regu regular whiteboard . Um you can choose the format , um sorry . Uh
B :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah , alright . Yep .
A :  Let me see .
A :  Um
A :  Well
A :  I guess it's maybe because I'm not s uh pen selected .
A :  Yep . Current colour , you can choose another colour . And um for example
A :  black , and you c I can choose the line width . Um so now I d have a different
A :  line width and uh colour . Okay . Quite easy , if you uh do have any questions , just c ask me . Um to um oh well , I'm I wrote down the documents uh should be in the project documents folder if you want to uh discuss it with us . Um as a little training um I will ask Ruud first to draw uh uh your own animal on a new slide uh with uh a different colour and a different line width than the one uh now selected .
D :  Okay .
D :  Um green .
D :  An animal . Okay . Um
D :  Uh a wee rabbit .
B :  It's a bunny .
A :  A rabbit . Okay , well great . Um Roo , could you do the same please ? But a different animal with a different colour and a different line width .
C :  Alright .
B :  But of course , Flores .
B :  Blank .
A :  Sebastian is thinking about the animal .
C :  I'm just uh guessing what should be my favourite animal .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , I'm think about it too . Format .
B :  Well , it looked more than a bunny than a cat , but it works , right ?
C :  Well , I'll give it a try .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It it should be a cat . Okay ?
C :  Mm .
A :  I'm guessing a horse .
C :  Very good .
B :  With a very small legs .
C :  I was very good in drawing .
B :  You should feed that uh that animal .
C :  Well , I guess you uh get the idea .
A :  Yes , okay .
C :  Beautiful .
A :  Beautiful .
A :  Okay , so um you can use this at any time during the presentation if you want to . Um any questions well , just just let me know . Um okay , back to our project . Um the remote control we are going to develop um will have a selling price of about twenty five Euros . Uh the profit we are looking for for this product is fifty million Euros ,
A :  which is quite a number . Um we uh we will focus this internationally , so the product will be sold um , if there is market uh interest , uh in in more than one country . And um the production costs should not be more than uh twelve Euro fifty , so we should keep that in mind by uh w w during the development , um because uh , well , those are important numbers . Um then the discussion , maybe the time for Sebastian to show his presentation .
C :  Yes , um I have some technical uh issues which I would like to present to you uh before we start the discussion , because uh there might be some uh influations influences . Okay ?
A :  Limitations .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay , great .
C :  Okay .
C :  Um first about my role , role of the Industrial Designer . I would like to think about uh the implementation of uh of things , and the technical possibilities and impossibilities . So if someone of you comes up with uh ideas , uh I'll try to translate them in technical functions , but uh there might be some impossibilities . So that's one . Uh I also will propose some uh um
C :  uh some implementations for that , but well , these are quite the same . Sorry about that . Um and I also will remind people of some new technical possibilities which are available and which might be interesting to implement in our product .
B :  Okay .
C :  I have some uh initial ideas about some things um which are maybe nice to take with you in the upcoming uh discussion . One thing about uh interopera operability . Um I think a modern uh remote control should uh control a device diverse subset of equipment . Uh for instance , uh D_V_D_ players , cell phones , video and audio equipment . So one re uh one remote control for all your equipment .
B :  And for a cell phone ?
C :  Well , there should be some interoperabi interoperability between them .
B :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  I think it could come in handy . We should discuss that . Um and we should think about the way how these things uh should communicate with each other . We're not uh living in the uh nineteen eighties anymore , so infrared is not uh
C :  is not really uh hot uh technical stuff anymore . But you should uh think about the things like uh Bluetooth .
B :  But
B :  Yeah , but the infrared , it's uh , well , a little bit old-fashioned , if you would call it like that . But all the T_V_s are uh equipped with infrared , so
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But it's cost-effective .
C :  Yes .
C :  Mm-hmm . Well , not all , not all . So that's the point . So
B :  y you you can
B :  Most of them . Or you shou sh use a you should equip infrared and Bluetooth together in one remote .
C :  Maybe , but that's uh something we should discuss and uh about every everybody should think about it . So that's just my role , I'll just uh give you uh everybody some technical input , and I think now the time is to have a little discussion about what uh the product should be and how it should look , but take these things into account when you start the discussion .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so the the main por uh the main points you are uh telling us are focus on the inter uh operability , and
C :  Yes , so one thing uh one remote control should uh control one or more uh pieces of equipment , and the way of communicating with these equipments .
A :  Okay , and and uh
A :  Okay . Okay , good . Um that was your presentation ? Okay , okay . Um okay . Great . Um
C :  Okay .
C :  That's it .
A :  I'll go back to my own presentation . Um
A :  Mm . Okay . Um I I do think it's time now to to discuss uh mm some things . Um Sebastian told us a few things about the technical implemen uh implications . Um there are other things like um how to make it trendy , which is I think uh um most uh Ru uh Ruud's uh role . Um the way how it should be controlled by the user , which is uh Roo uh r uh during this part . Um so let's start with you . H how do you think the remote should um function for the user ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well , I had a few uh things in mind . Um well , the interoperability , just like uh Sebastian said , um the remote should work on different T_V_s or even different uh um
B :  Yeah uh , what is it , devices ?
A :  Yep .
B :  Um so i i I think it's a universal remote control for customers to buy just new in uh a store . It's not for uh for uh for uh Philips or whatever to buy our remote for their own product , right ?
C :  Yes , I think it should be something like that .
A :  Okay , so we're we're going business to consumer , not we're we're it's not a
B :  Yeah , I do I don't know that . It's no I have uh don't have the information for it .
C :  We're not developing this product for a specific vendor , are we ? No , we're just developing this product , and we want to sell it to a very broad uh public , so it should fit to every device .
A :  No . No .
B :  No , okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh Ruud , y do you agree ? Okay . Okay .
D :  Yeah , I think I think they're right , yeah .
B :  Um
B :  Well , the techni fu technical function uh what you said is just by pressing the button you should change the state of the T_V_ . That's just the basic f technical function . So that was my really my part for uh this session . Um
A :  Yeah .
A :  So is that ease of use or uh is that more like um
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well , that's just the fu the technical function is pure what should the remote control do , wh what is his task uh as an uh as an uh device . It just should change the T_V_'s state . So that's it . Um but furthermore
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  And you you see uh the buttons as a as a means of doing this ? Or are there any o other controls ? Are there only any other cont
B :  Yeah . Yeah , with buttons . Yeah , or maybe you want a touch-screen or
C :  Well , I I've seen these remote controls with uh this little stick uh which you can move forward , sidewords . You know these things . And um it's very easy for a user to to switch w yes , to to switch b uh between uh channels or uh change uh between tracks on a on a C_D_ , on on a chapters , you know , on a D_V_D_ player . So maybe that's an idea , I don't know .
B :  But
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  They're very vu vulnerable .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . And for other user interface I had um , well , it's more industrial thing . Uh point at a T_V_ , I think it's it's quite disturbing when you always have to point directly to the T_V_ , so you must point everywhere , so maybe infrared is
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
A :  Maybe not even pointed . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , just don't even point it , so in that case infrared should uh maybe uh be restriction to that .
C :  Mm-hmm . Uh is that uh are there restriction for the range , the operating range too ? So when you're not able to point at the device um the range is very limited .
A :  Okay Uh
B :  Yeah , if you g if you go to radio or or yeah . For T_V_ , you're always in in the neighbourhood of a T_V_ , so I don't think think
B :  the range should be a problem to that , but if you want to uh get it working with a radio , and you're in outside your garden with just one uh speaker , then maybe the range should be uh
C :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , gentlemen , um uh just a reminder , we d we have five minutes left for this meeting um okay .
B :  But
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Two more things . Um
B :  You should able to feel the buttons without uh it mis um you have to know what you do without looking at the buttons , so it should be as user interface um for feeling should be uh good to understand . You must feel the buttons for volume or whatever , I think . And of course you don't always know where all buttons are , so it should be visible al um in dark too . So when it's dark
A :  Okay , s yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Those are two really uh user interface
A :  Uh I'll write down glow in the dark . Is tha Okay . Okay , um uh I just want to hear uh Ruud's um input for this meeting . Um do you have anything already w um ab idea about how the market uh will respond to the such a product ? Or what we should take um in account when developing such a product ?
B :  Yeah . That's perfect .
C :  Okay . Do do you
D :  Uh I think most most things have already been said , like uh control multiple devices .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And uh , yeah , infrared might be an issue .
A :  Because ?
D :  Uh well , he said about n abo what he said about pointing . But uh lots of devices already use infrared . So
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  we'll probably have to implement that .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , Sebastian , did you have any other ideas ?
C :  Um well yes , I had , uh about three minutes ago , but I've seem to forget them forgot them . Um oh yes , I remember . Um you said something about visibility in the dark . Um
B :  Yeah .
C :  uh would it be nice for a user to have display on this uh remote control , on which you can see functions ?
C :  Which makes it easier to operate it .
B :  Yeah . Well , maybe I um but it it can be quite simple , you can just have white buttons with a black mark on it . The uh the the digits in black . Uh then it's already visible in dark . So it it don't have to be a lightning or or a fancy well , it can be for design , of course .
C :  I I don't know .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Yeah , yeah , okay , because because we wa we want to develop a trendy product . So
C :  Yes , but there's a cost limitation too . Well , that's more
A :  Yeah , twelve Euro fifty , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So that's a big problem , I think . I think the the financial part of this project uh implicates that it's not going to be a high high-end product . The cost price is very low . Um
A :  Okay .
B :  Just remind something . The digits of uh the the painting on the buttons should not fade . You have a m uh
C :  Okay . Very good point . Yeah .
A :  Okay , okay .
B :  Always have s the soft buttons , always uh
B :  clear the the the paint on it . The marks .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , um I ha I have one point f um which which comes in mind now . Um uh d I think the device should either be rechargeable very easily um or it should not consume too much um power . Because it's very annoying if you need to change the batteries every s uh uh every other week .
C :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  So um
A :  maybe we could um for example uh only light the buttons that are um uh applicable at that moment or yeah . I dunno , it's uh that's more Sebastian's uh um
B :  But um
B :  Necessary , yeah .
B :  Yeah . But then Bluetooth uh might be problem . 'Cause I think Bluetooth uh
C :  Hmm .
C :  It's use uh a lot of uh well Well , cell phones have uh integrated Bluetooth also and , well , it's it seems to work uh quite okay . So uh technically it will be possible .
B :  Yeah , I know it from the cell phone .
A :  Well does it ? I'm not sure . Uh
A :  Yeah .
B :  But you can't you can't use Bluetooth all the time , twenty four hours a day . Does it
A :  Okay . Gentlemen , I'm afraid we do not have any more time . Um
C :  No , you cannot .
B :  It's over ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  so we will go back to our own uh work . Um next meeting starts in thirty minutes and um , well , you know your o your individual actions or your personal coach will probably email you about th it . Um so
A :  this was it . See you in thirty minutes .

D :  Hmm .
A :  What should it look like ? Okay .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Oh , let's kick it off . Oh , there we go . So , our new project is about we need design a remote control for television set , so , which has to be original , trendy and user-friendly . I took this off our corporate website . It's I think well it sums up what we need to do .
A :  We're inspired by latest fashion , not only electronics , but also the latest trends in clothes and interior design . That's why our product will always fit in your home . So apparently we need to um be very at um very open to what's currently hot in the market . So that's what you need to do to bring us the latest info and what people want . So
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So we put the fashion in electronics . So that's what we need to go for . Anyway , we'll take this project in three steps , three pha uh three phase of design . First step will be the functional design . And that's basically what we're gonna do . Everybody has uh a piece of individual work and a meeting afterwards , so we can share information about So I'm gonna keep this short , since we had a technical problem . So skip through this .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh . Okay . Every meeting we everybody can present their uh their views and everything , so to help with these , you have we have the SMARTboards here . We can use a regular PowerPoint presentation . I'm supposed to give you an introduction on this doodling board , so it's actually it's very easy . Like it says , very simple , you just take out the pen .
A :  Like you see here , I'll just take the take here . That's it , you just put it on the board . You see a pen here . You go here , just like using a pen . You can just draw whatever you want .
A :  It's like the eraser , can erase whatever you want .
A :  And so it will be easy just to illustrate your views , if you wanna change the format , you just either take out jus just like the pen , and whatever you want , your current colour , your line width , just to make the line bigger .
A :  So it should be really easy . This is to take the just take a new slide and back again . We're just gonna keep using this board all the time , so I think it will be it's very clear for everyone , I suppose . So I'll take this out .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . We'll use that later . Anyway . Yeah , just just just stuff that you wanna share , just put it in the in the project folder , like I put my presentation now . I'll put the the minutes of every meeting , I'll put them there too , so everybody can read up if they have to leave early or whatever .
A :  So next , been here . Well , gonna give the electronic white-board uh a shot . So basic idea is
A :  we have a blank sheet . Just try whatever you want , and like it says , draw your favourite animal .
A :  I think the creative genius should go first .
B :  The creative genius ? Thank you very much .
A :  So , draw us your favourite animal .
B :  Well , I'm more into the technical aspects of drawing , so I'm not really good at drawing animals , but uh the animal which I Oh .
A :  Draw us a technical animal .
A :  Yeah , it's still erasing .
B :  Pen .
B :  Uh format .
B :  Else my animal will be like king-size . I pretty much like a dolphin , because of its uh its freedom basically . Let's see .
B :  A head .
B :  actually worked with this . It's like uh it's a very
C : 
B :  Uh high-tech . Bit low-responsive though . Prefer pen and paper .
A :  So that's what we don't want . We want a high-responsive product . So
A :  It looks more like nuclear bomb .
D :  Very nice dolphin .
B :  It doesn't look like a nuclear bomb . This thing isn't doing what I'm
C : 
B :  What I want .
B :  So
A :  Let's go easy on it .
B :  Yeah , well it does look like a nuclear bomb .
B :  I'll just finish up real soon , because I'm
B :  So it doesn't really look like a dolphin , but then again , this is all new for me .
A :  Anyway , it should It It's supposed to be a dolphin , you like the freedom that it that it represents .
C :  Uh-huh .

C :  Okay .
D :  Uh yeah .
C :  Okay , you should press next .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Press next . Yeah , it's up there .
C :  Okay .
A :  That's it .
C :  Okay , well the animal I'd like to draw is a tiger .
B :  You picked a hard one , didn't you ?
D :  Experience with the tiger .
C :  My drawing skills are really bad , so .
D :  What ? They are
C :  They are really bad , my drawing skills .
D :  Okay uh-huh .
A :  Sure looks smooth .
D :  Oh .
C :  I'm not sure how the legs should go , but
C :  Uh these are stripes .
B :  Got it .
C :  I've picked this animal because it's very fast . It is uh it knows exactly what it wants . Uh it hardly ever wastes any resources .
A :  What does it want ?
C :  Uh well , basically uh it hunts for prey , but it does it always in a very well-thought way . Uh it knows exactly what it wants . It never kills an animal uh just for the killing , so it's very efficient . And it tries to do everything as fast as possible . And it always goes for uh security , in seeking uh uh a hide spot and uh and doing everything , security , speed and efficiency is important . And I think uh those things we can use .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
A :  I agree .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yay , I'm supposed to draw the animal next .
A :  I introduce to the world the amazing
A :  ant .
D :  Uh hard worker .
A :  Great team-workers .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Do everything to Uh really small , but together they're really strong . So I'm gonna give it a smiley face .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Oh .
A :  Not sure where the p . Just put 'em here . Whatever .
A :  Think it need shoes . So
A :  I'm just too lazy to draw it all black , so
A :  That's the coolest ant ever .
B :  You've done this before , haven't you ?
A :  I love to draw ants . It's my hobby . Anyway Nah . Just I think it's very representative what we drew , I guess . Like you take just take your freedom and use a a trendy interface that you design for us .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Just Yeah . You're supposed to make i make it different from uh from what other people have , and just make it a little distinct . Anyway . another beep to stop the meeting . See . Warning . Finish meeting now .
A :  Uh put this down .
A :  Examples . Well I guess we have a little little time extra , but Just a little quick discussion to to open open our work . So what do you guys think about The first idea is just very short . I'll start with you . What are y What are your first ideas for the new product ? What
B :  Well , I basically had a question . Do uh Are we going to introduce a multi remote control ? Is it just the T_V_ or do we want to in
D :  Uh
A :  The project I got was just for a T_V_ remote control .
B :  Just for T_V_ remote control . Okay . Well , I was thinking about design remote control , with our uh motto and all . Uh thing to keep in mind is that we need to stick to what people are familiar with . No rational changes or whatever , 'cause it revolutionary changes , yes .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I guess so .
D :  But
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so very intuitive design , I guess .
B :  Uh we might have to consider other design aspects of our product . So that was something I wanted to add , and perhaps some usability aspect . T_V_ is becoming central in most homes . Do we want people who are disabled in any way to uh , yeah , to be able to use it as well ?
A :  Yeah , we want
A :  I suppose we want almost everyone to be using it . So I think I mean , really disabled people , yeah , might be a problem , but I think it's a little take it into consideration . Um yeah . I think we really need to cut the meeting short . You have anything you wanna share quickly ?
C :  Hmm . Only one thing uh that has to be added according to me is uh the the material it is made of , it should be something light . That's it speaks for itself , but some uh Yeah .
D :  Uh .

A :  It should be light , okay . Um , let's see , where did I Let's skip that . Oh , this is it . Sorry , I skipped this sheet .
