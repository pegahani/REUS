C :  Okay .
B :  So I see all everybody's here , 'kay .
D :  Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And we can start meeting .
C :  Okay .
A :  What's the agenda for this meeting ?
B :  The I will uh
B :  present here agenda with with with with slides
A :  Okay .
B :  to you . Um
B :  as you can see here .
D :  Perfect .
B :  So first uh just to mention I will
B :  take notes uh of this meeting and uh I will try to work them out and give them to you . I've also made notes of the previous meeting and um I was about to send them you but then uh I had to go to this uh meeting so you will get them too uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Next .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um .
D :  So y you are the secretary also . Right ? Okay .
B :  Yes . Indeed .
B :  Um .
B :  Then I hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . Um . W We will uh in a minute we will uh start with them . Um , we will see in which order we will handle them of . Um then I will uh bring in some some some new requirements I I got uh from the uh account manager , I try to work them out , they were quite abstract , and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . Uh Um about the functions and Well in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group
D :  Perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  and the functionality of the
D :  You mean the social target group who we wants to target ?
B :  Yes I mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this , the customers , indeed yes .
A :  Mm .
D :  Oh the customers , okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Think that's that's important matter .
A :  That's the big question yeah .
B :  Uh . So And then uh we will close this meeting uh and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch . Good .
B :  Um .
B :  Maybe um
B :  why uh Anna can you c do you have a presentations ? You don't have presentation ?
A :  No , I don't . I wasn't .
A :  No .
B :  Uh you want a table to to uh
A :  I c I can talk about it but I have no slides or anything .
B :  Yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um .
A :  Mm-hmm . Well I've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group so , a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . Um .
A :  It's probably can't email this to you , I've just got a web page with some data on it . Um basically it's saying that
A :  users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . Um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Um .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Um . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . Uh . Fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality but really most of the time they only use a small part of that .
B :  Mm .
A :  Um .
B :  Do you Do you have this uh information on the web page you said ?
A :  I have an a web page yes .
B :  Yes , mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh .
A :  Yep . Yep , sure .
B :  Uh about this .
A :  Mm-hmm . So basically um there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . Um , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour . Um , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . Um . Teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour , so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . Um .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  An interesting thing that this report has brought up is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . Um . Thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps .
B :  Yes yes , I have that too .
B :  Mm .
D :  It's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's
A :  Um .
A :  Thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . Yep .
D :  Okay too much time to learn . Okay .
A :  Um . And thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . I don't know how we'd go about combating that . For R_S_I_ ? Respet Repetitive strain injury .
D :  Not enough
C :  . What do you mean there ?
C :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
A :  So . But
B :  They think that or do their doctor the doctor says ? But it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh ?
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . That's what the report says yeah . Um and then it's got a demographic breakdown on
B :  So mm .
D :  Maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the
A :  Uh I should be able to actually , if I email it to you now .
C :  You can disconnect it there no ?
B :  You can maybe just just
D :  Ah it's it okay it's a webpage on the C_ it's a file okay . O otherwise you yeah .
A :  Oh no , yeah .
A :  Yeah . Um , s hang on .
C :  Then you can connect this one or this one yeah .
D :  You can connect this one .
C :  All to your computer .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well .
D :  So these are important numbers that Matthew and I need to take into account for our functional um
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  Oh I need to muck around with this . It's probably easier if you put it on yours and then I'll just email it to you . It's just a web link .
D :  Yeah
B :  Hmm .
C :  Okay .
D :  Yeah these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account
C :  Hmm .
D :  for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design .
C :  Yeah .
A :  One thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , is the hang on a minute .
D :  Because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep . Um , one thing is interesting is talking about
A :  um speech recognition in a remote control .
D :  Speech recognition in
A :  And who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful .
B :  D do you have numbers o o on that ?
D :  Ah okay .
A :  Yes , I'll just get this up .
D :  So that we don't Do we not need any button on the remote control it would be all based on speech . Okay .
A :  Well potentially yeah , um
A :  I think even for interesti yeah I think that would not work so well . You wanna have both options .
D :  Interesting idea .
D :  Okay .
B :  Well it would it would be a solution for uh when your
B :  remote control is lost , I mean when it has speech recognition then
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  uh i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . But the these are all quite fancy features I'm not sure whether
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well it would be f
B :  we will we can make this for for twelve Euro fi and fifty cents .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  No you can't .
D :  And we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , maybe you know ?
C :  Oh .
C :  Well , it depends you know like
C :  there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off ,
B :  Mm .
C :  one , two ,
D :  But it's quite noisy if there is the T_V_ uh shouting .
A :  Mm .
C :  twenty three , yeah . It's it's going to be li it's not going to be s so easy but
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yes , that that that that's mm .
C :  u usually it's going to be more of an isolated
B :  Do you have some more important facts or
C :  case but it's but I don't know with twenty fi
D :  Okay .
A :  Um
B :  can we go to the next presentation ?
D :  So you had to to to summarise maybe the
A :  Well
A :  This is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um .
A :  Ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , it goes down from there , seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . Yeah . But we sh Yeah , it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , um , which we'll be talking about later I think .
B :  Mm .
C :  Okay it's uh decline . Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm . Decline with age , mm .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Yes . We will talk about it later . Okay .
A :  Did you get the email ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep , that one . Just follow that link .
D :  I thi You us yeah yeah .
A :  It'll be in a different window , yep .
A :  That's left that one .
A :  Yep .
D :  Okay perfect .
D :  .. .
A :  Mm . So that's the figure that I was just talking about there , with the different demographics . Another thing it's talking about there is the L_C_D_ screen but there's no figures apparently on that .
C :  Okay .
D :  Mm 'kay .
B :  Mm . Okay . um
B :  Uh maybe uh Mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm I okay I stay
B :  Oh , this is
C :  Now you can move I think yeah .
D :  I can move as far as
B :  Mm-hmm , y y you can move , uh .
D :  Maybe I take your chair ? I okay .
B :  Yes . You can you can sa take my chair .
C :  It's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , go to the .
A :  Sorry ? Oh .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So I think as everybody knows uh I'm the uh Industrial Designer .
D :  And uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control . Um I'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because I think in the product it is important .
A :  Mm .
D :  So basically um the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed . And so an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , alright .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the the main point is that I would wish to to make a really functional product . I would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . So for that yeah as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the Marketing uh Expert uh Anna and um
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control and I show you the the working design . So um basically uh here is a really large view of what we want . Uh we want an on off button , it can be uh it's simple but it's it's important , and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , right .
A :  Mm .
D :  So the components I quickly draw here , is that in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver so that's my method is um will be to well my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver . This is very quick uh design , uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And um so what I have found and after a lot of work actually I I draw this I draw for you this uh schema that can be maybe too technical for you but is very important for me you know . And uh that's it so I won't go into details about that but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components .
A :  Well .
B :  Uh-huh .
A :  You drew it a long time ago ?
B :  Is huh
A :  Ninety one .
B :  overwhelming .
B :  No .
B :  And and why do you want these kind of component ? I mean , are they cheap , or are they uh reliable ? What were your
D :  So .
D :  So the the main components you see here are the cheapest I have found and
D :  yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive , but uh this one was not this one also really uh reliable um so
B :  Mm .
D :  yeah that's it for the working design , uh I hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components but maybe yeah
B :  Yes .
B :  It it
B :  it's more clear now I think .
B :  So
C :  But is it uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in or you want to ma
D :  No no no no we we will uh This is a preference but we can always change uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  What I w what I was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver , I mean can you can you get back to it ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah uh , the receiver is of course already in the television and we are not uh able to change it . So we we must adapt to the to the receiver . I I suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh .
D :  Of course yeah .
D :  Yeah . We will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared and uh
D :  and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists and but we what we can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm .
B :  Yes . Okay .
D :  Um . Okay .
B :  Thank you .
C :  Well it to du it's just you had to change the frequencies .
D :  The frequencies ? Yeah yeah . Of course yeah in the chip you have it yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But you should be careful , people are sometime becoming problem , like a guy has recently designed a remote uh uh uh which could switch off any other T_V_s , so basically through all the things . So maybe we should think of yeah .
D :  That can control o other things .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Ah .
D :  Of course yeah we should take that into account in the uh
B :  Yeah yes I I I
A :  That's handy . So if the b T_V_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off .
C :  Yeah so you can just go on the street and then switch off everyone's T_V_ and you can just walk away You don't have to be near the T_V_ at all .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I I feel I I I think M Mael will will consider this uh th these things . Maybe Maybe we can go to to your presentation uh Matthew . I I I assume you were finished here . Uh okay .
A :  I like that idea .
C :  Yeah so .
D :  Yes .
C :  Okay . So I can take I think mine now there . Okay so voila . Hmm I can take mine it's okay , voila , mm so mm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  Oh . I
B :  Uh , sorry ? I know where it is .
C :  It's on the desktop .
B :  It's uh
C :  Technical function . Okay .
B :  Yes .
B :  It's uh
C :  Like so . Well . So um I'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , I think my last presented what is going inside , so what's the user is going to see from the outside and how he is going to use it . So well the approach is that uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
C :  basically the idea is to send a message to the T_V_ set , as Mael has pointed , and it will be decoded by the T_V_ and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons with which people can uh press and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the T_V_ and uh um a and basically it sends an internal signal and decoded by the receiver .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So p as um Anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , people are can have a speech recognition but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later . But in the present scenario is that you have certain keys and you press it like your mobile phone , and it sends a message to the T_V_ . And um so generally mm I don't have some figures sorry but um so there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , actually so you have a standard T_V_ remote where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yep .
C :  And if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , but uh uh . Then there is uh this is the standard one with without any fancy thing you know like i it doesn't have teletext option , it can without any , it's a very simple thing , um which which you can vouch .
C :  And then you have uh what's the v video remote file which is like usually it has almost all the keys over there and , but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those so these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And then whi which is generally used by the people . And then well personal preferences I would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing where the we could have both the uh the f a T_V_ and the remote video remote control because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the T_V_ they could be integrated together so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with
A :  Okay . How would that work ? So you've got say maybe a V_C_R_ and a T_V_ which are separate , so you on my one at home I've got a V_C_R_ remote which then changes the channel on the V_C_R_ and doesn't do anything on the T_V_ , so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the T_V_ or use the V_C_R_ ? or does it know which one you want to use ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Um actually um you could you could think of um having s a y you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing but um uh yo you you you still can't um in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the V_C_R_ option and you could play it or You can also think about having like um
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I in a few days you will be ha in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you and uh you can just you know uh when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program . In that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm mm mm mm mm .
A :  Mm .
D :  These are kind of next generation functionalities .
C :  It's the next generation thing , but it is going to come in couple of years . It's goi
B :  Mm yes , but I think it's i i it's already there , I mean the hard disk uh recorders uh I I've seen them in the shop .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah it's
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . So it's going to record your things and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard T_V_ thing .
D :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  That's fair enough .
A :  Mm . But I don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . That's , yeah .
C :  No no we are not making a universal remote , we are just looking at uh giving a scenario , I have a T_V_ and tomorrow I am going to have set up box which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm . Because y
B :  W w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mean , you can go pretty far I f I think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects yes .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah . So
B :  But it's good to keep in mind .
A :  Mm .
C :  Okay so that p ends my presentation .
B :  Mm . Very well .
C :  Well . So we can always discuss about it for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually so it i like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies , you can select actually so you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . And it basically you go off , it downloads the movie , it gives for you and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your T_V_ . And thi this is going to come .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Good .
D :  Or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed uh online uh yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah it can be streamed online for you and you can say what time I want to watch the movie and
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah so .
B :  Um ,
C :  Yeah .
B :  so u um I have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager and uh I would like to share them with you . Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions but it's it's getting used less and less .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  That's that's especially because of the internet of course . So we should think about it um . Do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh
A :  Hmm .
B :  on the remote mot control itself .
A :  Mm .
B :  Uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . Um
A :  Mm .
C :  Um .
B :  further yes we must think , uh do we stay uh to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back uh huh , or do we uh uh go further as Matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices ?
B :  Uh indeed indeed . And and and the hard disk recorders .
A :  So D_V_D_s and V_C_R_s ? Mm .
B :  Um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers and then with younger customers I mean people uh below the age of forty ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  and our our current customers are mainly forty plus uh which well Forty .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Fourteen or for O okay . So
B :  So that's to that's I mean there's a market but uh they will grow older older and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . Um therefore ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  younger people like trendy trendy designs , so that's w we should
B :  make our our our R_C_ as trendy as possible but
B :  it should also be uh have a reliable image , so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah it's uh well you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , you know right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys you press on the top , it takes one number , you press on the bottom it takes another number , and uh basically uh uh so the space covered so that you don't see two separate keys there actually so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Ma Maybe Maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh
A :  Mm . But I think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , that's the the the mm the new and the funky things , that's , yeah , there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , not too many pretty remote controls . That's
C :  Yeah so .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Yes yes mo
D :  Because they are already used to that , you know , product . Yeah .
B :  Yes it's recognisable
B :  Mm mm .
B :  And and they are skilled uh by using it .
A :  Mm .
C :  So for example uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well uh
D :  .. .
C :  Okay , it works . Fine . So , for example you have uh presently uh keys like one , two ,
B :  Mael can you hand me over this uh ?
D :  Yes .
B :  Uh thank you .
C :  three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  uh keys like that
A :  Okay .
A :  How much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? 'Cause we haven't talked about demographic at all and it's a very important issue .
B :  Mm well I think fi five min Mm-hmm .
C :  Forty minutes ?
C :  Yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so .
C :  too sorry , so we basically don't change the uh original order of them but then the keys are more spacious , they don't look uh so there there is a very sligh thing , so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , uh four , sorry four here uh five and six , so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered but it looks nice for you don't have too many keys but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
B :  'Kay I I think now that the idea's clear . Uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group .
D :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . Which I think is quite tricky . Um , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Of course they have already one . So our our our remote control has to be better .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But it's not going to have more functionality , 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , we can't beat modern functionality , we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it but that's not a big seller , if they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , they have to actually need it as well . So I'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm . I well I think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh
A :  Mm .
B :  uh the appearance of the uh R_C_ is is important when they are buying one but
A :  Yeah . But why are they buying one in the first place ?
B :  Indeed .
B :  So that will be about
B :  functionality
A :  Mm . But if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . I've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . In that case they wouldn't buy our product , because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality .
B :  Mm . Mm-hmm . Mm .
B :  So your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance
A :  Well , we can't , with the price range . We We're not building a universal remote , we're not building a high end product .
B :  What do What do you think about What componen
D :  Yeah we have yeah twelve point five Euros uh per uh per R_ s R_C_ and I think uh with this now you know that chips are very uh cheaps and uh we can include it in our control some new new features . Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  And um But yeah that's
A :  But yeah .
A :  If we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to L_C_D_ screens and things like that which would drive the cost up a lot .
B :  I don't know . I don't know whether that's necessary . Is the L_C_D_ screen
D :  I don't think L_C_D_ is not necessary well , th for long term .
A :  For universal remotes
A :  If you mm .
B :  I think thi this could be this could be a market because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive .
A :  And quite complicated to use , yes .
B :  S so we can try to go in between , and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as
A :  Mm-hmm . Not as flexible maybe , yeah , but s yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh
D :  Universal .
B :  R_C_ because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own T_V_s to use a remote control on .
B :  Mm yes but w we're targeting I think on more on the on the twenty to forty group .
A :  Okay . So they're yeah .
B :  People yes . Who just have or already have a job and have the money but
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yep .
A :  I don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is . Are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , or are we kind of middle to bottom ? I don't know .
B :  Uh well
D :  Mm .
B :  I think uh when we think it over I thi I think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So d Do you agree ?
C :  Well
C :  Well I it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive .
D :  Yeah because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is uh price of a chip is very cheap . So I'm okay for designing um a ne uh less yeah a a kind of universal uh R_C_ yeah .
C :  Uh and it d uh
C :  Our provin
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm . You think it's possible for the twelve Euro fifty ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Um so
B :  then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control .
C :  Uh yeah , that's that's what we needed basically .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm . Mm . Okay .
C :  Uh that's needed right now . And uh basically you can look to the standards of other
D :  Yeah that's needed , yeah . And if we want to get the market , we really need that .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So I guess what I'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , V_C_R_ and T_V_ .
D :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Exactly .
A :  And just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them .
D :  Is that okay for you ? Yeah .
B :  Mm mm mm mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So given we are going for this uh
B :  uh universal type uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market .
D :  Yes .
A :  Mm .
C :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm yep .
C :  Voila .
C :  Hmm .
B :  So anyone uh has a point to bring in or shall we no .
C :  So .
C :  Well .
C :  Oh I don't have anything right now . We can we'll we'll go and we'll I'm sure we'll up something good for the
D :  Oh that's that's fine then .
B :  Okay .
B :  W yes , we uh we can have lunch now . So um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah so we meet in well what are our
B :  Then th
B :  th the next meeting will uh after lunch you have uh we have
B :  uh thirty minutes of work and then we have the next meeting . But you will be informed via the computer . Okay .
C :  Okay . Cool . So see you later .
D :  Okay perfect .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay everyone's ready .
B :  Hello .
A :  So we are here for uh for uh functional design .
A :  Okay ? So we are here for the functional design meeting mm so first I will show the agenda so
A :  we will uh I will take notes during this meeting so
A :  I will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards
A :  so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design .
A :  Then I will uh present you some new project requirements I received from uh the management board .
A :  Then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions
A :  and then I will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . Of the of the process . So uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did ?
D :  Mm .
C :  F do you want to start ?
B :  Make a start yeah . So . Cable , camera . Should be in my in their folder no ? Up .
A :  You can start .
A :  You have uh PowerPoint ?
A :  Ah yeah maybe there . Okay . Who are you ?
B :  Um at three I think .
B :  No ? Mm .
A :  Ouch .
A :  And
C :  Okay .
A :  We have a technical problem uh .
B :  Do we think w s in the in the wrong folder maybe ?
B :  It is possible .
A :  You put it on
C :  No .
B :  It was somewhere in something like this . I don't remember the name actually must be something like messenger AMI or something .
C :  What do you have in short cut ?
B :  Go up .
C :  Participant two .
B :  Yeah go up .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Again .
B :  No . Go back .
A :  You have no
B :  Uh maybe messenger AMI .
B :  Messenger .
A :  Over .
A :  Okay .
B :  No . There is nothing .
A :  There's no
B :  Let's go and check . I'll go and check .
A :  We have a technical problem .
C :  Yeah . Otherwise , could you just describe
C :  by hand ? With the the whiteboard ?
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  If you remember yeah but that's
B :  Yeah . So uh . Basically what we want here is a remote control right . So um the question well first of all what to control . So most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and T_V_ and stuff like that . And but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , so there's a project I think called X_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff . So there is one that is one thing . The other is the
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . Uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have
C :  Okay .
B :  uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So I think it should be a package in that case . Uh so the user interface will consist of two parts . One is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . Uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space ,
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah ?
C :  What do you mean by linear access then ?
B :  Like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah .
C :  Ah .
B :  Um .
A :  Okay so special navigation , linear access , random access and there's a fourth one no ?
B :  Mm ?
A :  So the better now for special navigation ?
B :  Yeah . For special navigation for example you might have a T_V_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ? Uh .
A :  Okay . Then linear access then random access .
B :  Mm . Yeah and also parameter changing . So if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um or maybe we could have everything uh generic but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff .
A :  Ah yeah parameter okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay and and voice command did you uh
B :  Voice command w we could specify anything . We could assign any button a command to any button , if we have enough processing power , I guess so . Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So that's uh that close your investigations ?
B :  Yeah . Uh yeah I think so . Not so far .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with
D :  Yeah . Um I dunno if you can open the uh m is not here .
A :  I dunno if I can open it . Maybe you can s
A :  It's
D :  Uh in
D :  yeah okay . No .
A :  Messenger no ?
D :  In document .
D :  Mm computer yeah .
A :  In which folder ?
B :  Where did you put it ?
D :  Here . Here .
A :  Short-cut to AMI shared folder ?
B :  mm .
D :  But it's not
D :  Um .
A :  Maybe you can send it to me by email .
A :  Just to participant one .
D :  Mm-hmm . Yeah , I can do that .
A :  At AMI .
A :  I will try to show it to everyone , that would be more comfortable .
D :  Okay . Um .
A :  You send it ?
D :  It's participant one ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Uh this is this email .
B :  I'm designing the user interface .
D :  Okay . You can uh .
A :  Okay .
A :  So maybe I can switch slides when you whenever you ask , that will be more convenient . So okay , functional requirements .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay so you can you can go .
D :  Okay so in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects and the subjects also filled a questionnaire okay ?
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And here I have the results so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly so we have to find something to make them more
D :  more nice , more kind . Eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . Eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look oh to it's not good . So okay . So it's not in theory but I I can I can say yeah .
A :  We can just keep doing that ?
A :  Yeah .
D :  Fifty f uh seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . So mm we have to have a remote control uh very um out for that . Uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks . Um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control . So all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use and not only or
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , so fewer buttons maybe would be good ?
D :  Yeah . F not many buttons , and uh and uh uh u useable buttons .
A :  Okay .
B :  But what kind of remote controls did you look at ?
D :  Sorry ?
B :  What kind of task was it ? It was a T_V_ ?
D :  Yeah . Uh most for most is T_V_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a T_V_ remote control according to new requirements I received from the management bo I will present them in the following . Okay .
B :  Huh .
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Ah ! Good .
D :  'Kay you can go so .
D :  So there are other frustrations expressed by users , so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to
A :  Yeah .
A :  To find it . Yeah .
D :  to find it . Um and um lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . So they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
D :  And uh remote controls are bad for
D :  R_S_I_ um
A :  What is her other side ?
D :  I dunno .
B :  Other side yeah , yo wa your wrist .
B :  It i can become painful you can have tendonditis .
A :  Oh yeah ? I did not knew that .
B :  Yeah .
B :  If you also up on a computer in a strange position .
A :  Okay so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah .
B :  Ergonomic . But uh . Have to say ha ha .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It's your job Oh .
D :  Uh .
A :  Uh sorry got a message from Microsoft .
D :  Okay um before that I I have some some some thing uh to say before um
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah yeah .
D :  We know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel . Um and um to to change uh volume selection of the and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that . So it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set and uh and
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  This function should be very uh accessible . Yeah , okay . This is the main function okay .
D :  Very accessible yes .
D :  That's right .
D :  So then we asked some questions to them and um we asked this question if they prefer an L_C_D_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control and you can go we have here the results of
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  The first question .
D :  of the questions . So you know that um
D :  for the younger it's very important
A :  To have L_C_D_ and voice .
D :  to have the s yes and speech recognition . And uh and the others is not so important but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot T_V_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh . So maybe we we can have a speech recognition in . Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah maybe this this is important . Moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment and so we can we have to take care of that point of view I think or so .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm . Okay and if there is th the conclusion now . So as we say before , I think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing . Uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before , e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock and to to
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
D :  An I s no , yeah . I dunno if you see something else important or
A :  Okay these are the user requi
C :  I'm just thinking of some thing . Um
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  We want to have a no , I don't know if this is a good idea . We want to have a a general remote control for everything .
A :  No no no . We w it seems that we no want to have a T_V_ remote control . From the management board I receive an email . Cos it would be costly
C :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control .
C :  Yeah . Yeah yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm I it's not true I think .
B :  The the second claim that you put .
C :  No no .
A :  That it would be too long to develop .
B :  Yeah . I think that should be the same .
A :  Oh yeah . Because I received that email from management board and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on T_V_ more where it seems that the market is more important .
A :  So maybe it's a good decision . I dunno . What's your opinion ?
B :  I have uh I've no idea I mean I should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it . I don't think
B :  Uh yeah .
C :  Finish tonight . But basically yeah maybe I can continue with my presentation , it would be al you you but I think we have some technical problem or so . So I'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control . If fact
B :  Yeah . Okay . Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do I don't know .
C :  Yeah but
D :  Mm .
C :  Do I have oh yeah . Now I have enough cables .
B :  Like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff .
C :  Okay so I'm just going to describe in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy . We just have sorry , I'm going
A :  Okay . Are you okay ?
C :  Like that . I'm just going to describe . Basically we have a a battery a power supply here . After that we just have um user interface . Let's say that
C :  something like that , which could be um a L_C_D_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that .
C :  Push button or a L_C_D_ . After that we we feed that into um
C :  uh an electronic chip . So I say U_C_ and I feed that to uh L_E_D_ which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component . And so what we for for myself this for for us this is quite easy .
A :  U_C_ is the central unit ?
C :  Yeah . Y it's a it's this just a chip which does all the um numerical
A :  Okay yeah .
A :  Computation .
C :  numerical computation according to your display . And so for us uh this is quite easy . We just need to take to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television . So for us this is quite easy .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay so this is quite easy . There is not that much constraints .
C :  Yeah . Um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition , in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple
B :  This will think this will take more time to develop also . Yeah .
C :  Yeah of course of course . And um but for a standard one this is really easy . It's a question of one month and so on s
B :  Soon .
A :  To have a you s you speak about with voi voice control ?
C :  No no no no , I say yeah standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that .
A :  Standard button one .
B :  Yeah . So the only time problem is the sp voice recognition . Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Definitely .
A :  So do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ?
B :  Ten years .
C :  I would say . I would say uh about eight months to have the first results .
A : 
A :  Okay so i it's a bit long yeah .
C :  Yeah . I can
C :  Um .
A :  One month for the standard one with button . Even if we have a L_C_D_ display ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah even . I mean that this is really standard devices now .
C :  Um eight .
C :  For uh speech recognition .
A :  Okay yeah .
A :  Okay so we can take this into account . So who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition ?
B :  But we don't have time to market .
C :  And also how much uh I think
A :  Yeah it will .
B :  I think we should contact management .
C :  during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five Euro per unit so how many units should we sell to have a
A :  Euros . Yeah , yeah .
B :  Well . Uh
A :  Well each unit is is sell uh twenty five Euros .
C :  Yeah but how many yeah .
B :  How muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units h no , one hundred thousand units .
B :  Eh chips . We're gonna need chips right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . How much will it cost for one hundred thousand ?
C :  Usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip .
B :  Okay .
A :  Because we are
B :  So you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition .
C :  Yeah , we can
B :  Yeah ? Okay .
B :  So . No it doesn't .
A :  It seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Four million .
A :  Okay . Maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement I receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have .
D :  Mm .
C :  I just had a question uh do you want to continue with your presenta ? Is it
A :  Yeah I I will continue . Well ask your question if you want .
C :  Um you say that I don't remember by heart but thirty per cent
D :  Mm ?
C :  of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ?
D :  Oh . Would j
C :  To to maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that .
D :  Uh yeah w I I think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it , it's it's okay . But
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm . And
A :  Okay . It's not intuitive first .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But yeah maybe and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? You say that I want , I have six button
B :  Mh-hmm . A a lot of people are uh if you have the L_C_D_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them but it will be hard to configure I mean imagine i uh so it's really something for the expert user . So
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But , but also it seems that
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  I mean there are markets and markets . I think the young people are th uh are uh Christine here said uh you have a uh it is yeah . So for our young people uh it will be cool , they can be able to use it . Th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . I guess . I don't know if there is study about that .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And there are another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else . All right ?
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Otherwise , if it's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . But also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons . So we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons and maybe also um
D :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  some lightning stuff too
A :  because most people find also hard to to find the remote control .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Losed lose it etcetera .
A :  These these are these two points are the main frustrations so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage
D :  Mm .
A :  without making something too complex and too long to develop .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So but le let us see first the new requirement . So we don't have to so this this uh is uh is um in the this is in the same direction as we were speaking so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that
B :  But teletext is just one button .
A :  Yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff .
B :  You you just write the write the numbers .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So will you add with the channel keys , right ?
A :  So well
A :  Yeah . So anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users , they prefer to s
B :  So .
B :  I am . I'm sure that uh it don't like but uh I don't see just one button .
A :  Yeah . I dunno . If i one button is still one more button . If if if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors .
B :  So .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well anyway I have this point . We can discuss . Also um so as as I told before uh it would be better if it's only for the T_V_ um
A :  because we want to be quick on on the market .
A :  And then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh
A :  this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product .
A :  So this is the the key point .
A :  So before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera .
B :  Capital .
D :  Mm .
A :  do you um so so from from the the Marketing Expert I think
A :  a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , it should be very simple and most button are never used only ten per cent of the button are are used often so I think we have to do something very simple and I think we all agree on that point , no ?
D :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Well if it is going to be just a T_V_ remote control it is going to be very simple .
A :  Yeah okay . So yeah the key point here is simple .
A :  Maybe . So few buttons , channel ,
A :  volume control
A :  and what el what function do you see
B :  Well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that I can see
A :  in addition to that ?
B :  really .
A :  Yeah . Maybe switch T_V_ on and off
B :  Uh no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us . Or something .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Volume , maybe a mute button , and then on off button .
C :  Mm .
A :  And that's all ?
C :  Uh I know that som you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I know tha I discovered that when I did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back .
B :  It's a memory , yeah .
A :  Okay . Yeah this is cool . Maybe we can include that also . Previous previous channel button . So we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and uh just the the traditional on off button .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And uh and of course the channel changing buttons .
A :  Yeah . I I talk about that , yeah ?
B :  How should they how should we implement that ? Because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental .
A :  Yeah . Incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Let's say that we can do something like that . This is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five .
C :  To go fa to go faster .
A :  We go faster ?
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm . It's an interesting idea , that if you press it for a long time it does something else , in general . So if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons and you have instead of having just one memory
C :  Yeah .
B :  you have if you press them for a long time
B :  No . Doesn't work does it .
A :  Maybe we should have also a digit button
B :  Maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands . Change channel to eight .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental . I dunno bec because if you have the
B :  No .
B :  Well if it's useful like if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental .
A :  Uh .
A :  Yeah . Because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one . So I think we need also digits . Maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time and
A :  Yeah .
C :  Or we can do something like that . We can design the remote control to have access . You know some remote control have uh protection and so you you y
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  You
B :  Hey I just thought this thing there is a I mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this . Instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , a kind of joystick .
A :  Yeah . Maybe we can have a wheel for incremental . Okay . So have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed so as you say protected ,
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  and uh yeah I think this is the basi
B :  On the lower side I think it you have to turn it . No ? If we do that .
A :  And do we do we have a
C :  Or a or a ball , yeah , not a a wheel but a ball , and you say uh to
A :  No , a wheel is better . I would say the wheel is better . What is the expert of uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Because of that
C :  Yeah .
B :  Because it's uh it's it's not like a volume which is smooth yeah ? The channels change one by one . So you have to the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , the yeah .
A :  Okay . Yeah . That's a good idea .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Well also we have to decide uh so it should be lightening in the dark I think because most people lost their remote control .
C :  'S quite it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the on the wheel .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . Even if i L_E_D_ uh or a if if it's the L_C_D_ feature uh whatever , yeah .
C :  A blue a blue L_E_D_ and we sell that um .
A :  Yeah , and do we put an L_C_D_ display ? Because it was important for young customers if you remember .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think it's only put on if cou have multi function . If you do not multi function then there is no p point in having L_C_D_ . Just increase the cost . The user does not have an advantage really .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  So no L_C_D_ ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Hmm .
A :  And so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process .
C :  Okay .
B :  Well if it's going to delay yeah but uh it will be cool . It would . Because a user could say C_N_N_ for example and it would go C_N_N_ . Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . That would be cool . But eight months is really long and
B :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe we can just uh
C :  Ten years
A :  Okay . So um I I will uh I will so I we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email I think but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent . So
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  thank you for uh your suggestion and I I will make a summary of that meeting that I will put in the shared folder you can't see and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided . Uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether . That would be easier .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay . Okay .
B :  Yeah . What is the folder that you put yours in ? And did it it did work ?
D :  Mm .
D :  No .
A :  No it did not work . She send it to me by email .
D :  No no . I dunno , I dunno it .
B :  Ah yeah . Mm .
B :  Okay .
A :  So maybe this is better , to send it by email . Okay ? So yeah I I'm it's in the first uh email so I'm participant one at AMI uh where is that , it's here .
B :  Okay what is your email ?
B :  At participant one . Okay .
A :  Participant one at AMI .
A :  Okay .
A :  So see you after lunch break .
D :  'Kay thank you .
B :  Well during lunch break actually .
B :  So next time we should have a fight .
B :  How about uh management or something .
B :  Who happens to be your friend .
A :  Afternoon guys .
A :  It's gonna be .
D :  Rock and roll .
A :  Oh .
A :  'Kay .
D :  So do we need to re-train Mike on how to put his mic on ?
A :  We may do .
C :  Think s
D :  Okay , can he get it all by himself this time ?
A :  I dunno , I'm feeling like a big boy .
C :  Mm . Pro
C :  Probably not , 'cause he's
C :  'S been listening to too much . He's getting retarded . Yay .
D :  So
D :  I believe I can fly .
B :  Alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys .
C :  Or not .
B :  Or not .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Just what I needed was something exciting .
D :  Remember , I'm an old man .
A :  'Kay , ready to go ? 'Kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting . Hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now . Uh k exciting ideas . 'Kay so here's our agenda our agenda . Um
B :  All ready .
C :  Apparently I'm old as well .
D :  Thirty's really young , eh ?
B :  We do .
A :  I'm gonna open . I'm gonna talk for a bit about what we're gonna do . I'm gonna take some notes . We're gonna all do a presentation , and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now .
A :  Yep . Well when I say hopefully , we have to . So
B :  Alright .
A :  I'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions .
A :  And does anyone really want to go first ?
B :  I guess I'll go first .
A :  You p two ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  What's
B :  Component , I think . Yeah .
A :  Components design .
B :  Yep that's it .
C :  Presented by name .
B :  My name is .
D :  Jose he man is .
A :  Your name is name ?
B :  My name is name .
A :  Huh hi name .
C :  My name is Inigo Montoya . You killed my father . Prepare to die .
B :  Sorry I did this in a bit of a rush .
A :  Right .
D :  N name .
B :  So so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control . Um you've got a printed a printed uh circuit board here , and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate
A :  We've all broke a remote control ri um s yeah .
B :  Yeah we've all broken a remote control . So you've also got um you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . Um
D :  I've
D :  I just love you tech guys , huh . They just
C :  Yeah there's a thingy and a dingy and
A :  You press this and it does th
D :  Yeah y do jabber .
B :  Well so you've got here's here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal , um you've got the L_E_D_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board . Um you've got a couple diodes here for I don't know who and whatnot .
A :  I dunno who and whatnot .
B :  So exactly . So um we've got a i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here , this is a eighteen pin um uh chip I dunno . Uh it's two double A_ batteries . This is pretty standard remote .
C :  Nah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So here are options for our power sources . You can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that . I don't know if that's really I don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so
A :  'Kay .
C :  I wanna change that .
D :  I I gotta I gotta flashlight , and uh yeah but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this . Like this .
A :  Okay .
B :  You shake it .
B :  Yeah . So that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy , so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it . Uh we've got solar cells , which I don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night which doesn't make a lot of sense . And finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea .
D :  And that's on the camera .
D :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ?
B :  M battery versus cradle I think is yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  I like the kinetic .
A :  So we have battery versus cradle
D :  I g I I figured you would . Yes . Yeah .
B :  It could be fun .
A :  It's actually a novel thing because you could sell it a as a novelty , just to be actually serious for a minute here , you could
B :  Yeah . Well it is it is more uh I mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle . So um
A :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
B :  our case design . We have uh choices in materials and choices in the general shapes that we can do . Our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium . If we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do because it's tough to shape the titanium , and uh
B :  Yeah pers
A :  Wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it .
B :  I think wood i I I can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , it's just anti-technology really , you know .
D :  It it it
A :  Nah .
D :  Uh .
A :  Okay .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative . We can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it .
B :  Right . And what we may be able to do , and I think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these . Um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , and also maybe i I think it feels a little better than the plastic .
A :  Okay .
A :  'Kay . Do you get a good grip on the rubber ? Yeah okay .
B :  Yeah um
D :  And if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand . You don't even need to lean down to get it .
B :  Yeah .
B :  The advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . So um and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um
A :  Okay .
B :  But basically these are curved and double-curved I I believe that the tech department , in their um in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . I have no idea exactly what they're talking about , but that's what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved .
A :  Okay .
B :  I would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , where it's curved on m m multiple axes , right ? I think curved means just curved in one axis and double-curved is curved in two axes
A :  Okay .
B :  or surfaces . I have no idea .
A :  I think it might mean something like that sorta shape because a double curve rather than a yeah that's what .
D :  Mm-hmm yeah that's yeah that's what I see . Yeah that's what I see also .
B :  Oh okay oh like a wave , okay . Alright that makes sense okay . Um okay , with the interface we have the following options , we can u we can use push buttons , we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , and L_C_D_ display , or multiple scrolling wheels .
D :  Ooh .
B :  Um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface .
A :  Okay .
B :  For electronics , we have these very technical um descriptions here . A simple chip , which is the least expensive , but I have no numbers to give you , a regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh
A :  D do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ?
B :  Yes the difference is , with a simple chip a simple chip will operate oh why doesn't this scroll up ?
B :  Previous previous , okay . A simple chip is required to operate push buttons . Um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the L_C_D_ display , and it didn't say specifically , but I I have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  So but yeah .
A :  Yeah that makes sense .
B :  That's the end of my presentation .
A :  So presentation from
A :  I guess design would go best .
A :  Next .
A :  Technical functions or interface concept ?
B :  I think
C :  Oh interface concept .
C :  Very long presentation .
A :  Yeah that's it .
A :  Yes , but it has your name on it .
C :  Well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well .
C :  Um so , somehow that thing's too big , but um okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . They say they could put it to work but um we don't think so .
B :  No .
C :  No . It it it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and
B :  If the T_V_ is working , yeah . That's just I mean it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a
B :  television show , it's gonna change the channel .
C :  Yeah and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore , and I think that's one of the things we wanna keep .
B :  So
A :  But what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? So if you pressed it and went , up ?
C :  That kinda would r d yeah . That would kind of lose it .
B :  Well then why don't you just press the up button ?
A :  Man yeah .
A :  But if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go
D :  That's right .
B :  Even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the T_V_ . It might not be it might not be completely confusing , but I think you'll still y it's still I don't think it's practical at all . I think it's a bad idea frankly .
A :  Up .
A :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Yeah so um taking that away , our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it or you know mistreat misuses
A :  Okay .
A :  You guys know your stuff .
C :  as it happens to remote controls . Um as for the
C :  point that we making about losing it . Well , we wanna small r remote control one side because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed , but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost , about
B :  That I would believe .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  But um yeah I think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that . Somehow .
C :  Um so the the what I would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh but without with a l a less complicated um design , so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . Uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext .
A :  So we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ?
C :  Ye no it's not i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross , so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone .
B :  That's not a scroll wheel .
A :  Nah .
A :  Oh okay okay . I see .
B :  Right .
B :  Instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter .
A :  Uh , okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah um yeah so I think we w we go for something mid-sized , so something looks good and uh is not too prone to get lost .
C :  That be it .
A :  'Kay .
A :  So on to
A :  Y functional requirements or trend watching ?
D :  I dunno . Trend watching I guess . Trend watching I believe .
B :  Trend watching has a later date there .
A :  forty six nineteen fifty seven . Yep .
D :  See what it looks like . It's been so long .
C :  .
D :  Well I don't know what to say . When I s when I see the when I see the product I I I I don't wanna buy it . I see so many of 'em out there . There's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there . Yeah yeah .
B :  Are you talking about the picture ? That's not our that's not our b design , that's just a that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay 'cause 'cause right now I don't have too much to say about how to market this product because we don't have a product to market yet . And uh from from talking to Mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now .
A :  Mm .
D :  That's what I understand so , hello .
A :  Upper management said yes . Uh e excuse that , that's a bit of spam .
D :  And and so yeah I'm a I'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that I'm gonna market ? Uh without special or increased marketable features I don't believe the product has a consumer demand . Uh I like the idea of of the scroll makin there are so many people making these products at this price right now . What are we gonna do to make this one special and unique ?
B :  What's special and unique about a scroll ?
D :  Uh well I don't yeah it's I I just see it as different . I don't say it's specially mm
A :  It's cool .
D :  I don't say it's special .
D :  Uh I say that it's different I what I'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . I give me a lower price , give me a higher price , give me some new technology , don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price .
D :  I need something to market about this thing . We're we're a new firm .
A :  I'd I'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well , but wi with a similar
D :  What i if when when we have yeah when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's as as a marketing standard I need something to market , to make this product unique .
B :  Well right I think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , having it look really nice um and also be really durable .
D :  Yep .
D :  Mm 'kay . Just remember when I made up this report I didn't have the information that we're discussing here . And and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , so what I'm saying is , from my perspective , I don't have a product to market right now .
A :  Mm . Course .
B :  Right yeah . Yeah .
D :  Um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower or develop an integrated new technol technology . That's that is the next step , there's technology and then there is technology , which we're moving into the next phase .
A :  Yeah 'cause that's .
D :  And so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability . Yeah uh again I'm not sold on the product because we don't have a product in my opinion yet .
A :  Mm .
D :  So I need a product . I need a product to market . And I just whatever product you guys put together , we'll find a way to market it . Tha that I'm not concerned with .
A :  Mm 'kay .
B :  Well let's get a product then .
A :  So now
D :  If you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then I need to I need to find a lower cost .
A :  So our big questions here really are
A :  cradle or not cradle ? Do we go basic or do we go for features ?
A :  Uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ?
B :  Well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ?
B :  Function-wise , what does that do that
A :  Oh but that was in your presentation so wh what would you imagine it doing ?
D :  Yeah wh wh what's the wh
B :  Yeah . Well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do .
A :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Okay now what I see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . So from a marketing standpoint I have I have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique . If it creates something more complex or more expensive , then I don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity . But again , from a marketing perspective I want as much new and different about this thing as possible because we're we're co it's a very competitive market .
C :  But would we
A :  Yeah .
A :  What I understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make . So I d
B :  Yeah .
B :  Th they are gonna be more expensive , but on the other hand , I mean , it
B :  I mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales I think maybe it's worth it to do it , but I mean I would just use if I was gonna do this I would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down .
B :  I don't think volume or do you think volume would be
C :  I dunno . I'll bet first in volume maybe . I dunno .
B :  No we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but
A :  Well I d I like the idea of basically focusing the my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh
A :  dock to put it in to to charge it . We can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things . It s i m makes it easy to market , it's easy to differentiate the product , yeah so .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah yeah . I think it's that's right . I think so .
A :  And if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus because you're not going to be ditching it as often . It's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
A :  So if we can market it in terms of that and yeah well
D :  Yep . I think we got some exclusivity in that , you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So our big decision then is like how do we do um like we have to decide on the details and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , but d do we have uh
A :  What type of casing ? I personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber .
B :  Mm-hmm . I'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , where there's you have plastic bits and then it's not really rubber but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside .
A :  Okay . Just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for
B :  Well no ma yeah maybe a bit more then th is on here but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens I think are are kind of
A :  Okay .
A :  So then if we d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons , or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go L_C_D_ ? Do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ?
C :  It's only a T_V_ .
B :  Or from from my perspective I think L_C_D_ is a mistake because this is a universal remote and all you're doing I mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last and there's just not a lot of information , you know , there . It receives no information .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  So I I don't see any reason for having an L_C_D_ 'cause it's an increased cost . Unless you can think of something interesting to do with it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah right now there's right now there's nothing coming out of the T_V_ to receive , so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there's no s I don't see the ,
B :  Right .
D :  I don't see the necessity of an L_C_D_ either . Don't see it .
A :  Okay so the question is now I guess we need t to
A :  decide on well y you guys basically have to now go and
A :  figure out the details of this thing . So , what we need to know in terms of marketing and uh project management are are there any other questions that we need to answer now before you guys can go and build this ?
A :  What what overall things have we not decided on ?
B :  Well we have to I think for me it's still not exactly clear exactly what the inter user interface is gonna be . There's the scroll wheel , in or out ?
B :  What do you guys like in the user interface ?
A :  I think maybe in terms of marketing , is that gonna make enough of a difference to justify the cost ?
D :  Again . Well I think it's it's the more uniqueness you can bring to the product , the easier it is , I believe , for me to market . Uh again the push-buttons I I see are are everywhere . And so we can go with the same thing , but we're gonna be com competing in a in a broader market than if we go with something unique .
D :  You know the other thing I thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ?
D :  Make a remote that doesn't look like a remote .
D :  It's just another it's just a an idea , and I don't know
B :  Well I dunno about like the flip-phone idea , because I think , as far as durability th it's not a big well maybe when it's closed .
D :  I mean what I see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff . This
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And what I keep throwing out there I just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost .
A :  Yeah and I guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? Because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost .
D :  Oh okay phew . I think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness . I think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , I think those are two very strong features , if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well
B :  The
B :  The locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , which will
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  That's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well ?
B :  Um we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s I would imagine .
C :  No it's just different .
B :  But we I we will need a receiver , an antenna .
D :  Integrated , yeah . So it's just uh I I think that's
B :  Yeah .
B :  It should be a really simple signal though so
D :  I know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button I can push to find my remote control .
A :  And it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep .
B :  That's true yeah .
A :  But I guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , it's not gonna need q quality , is it ? It's
B :  Oh yeah yeah . It'll be really cheap .
D :  Or maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama , you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink . You can
C :  Maybe not .
A :  Makes your living room more fresh as you watch .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Okay we're doing well for time here . Um we've got about another ten minutes . I think that uh
B :  So the scroll wheel ,
B :  in or out ?
A :  Mm pr my personal preference is out . I don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , and I don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah I think we have like and it's not very usable and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , 'cause it's it it breaks down easier .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  For me I think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . I don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , but I think he does have a point , i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . I think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that .
A :  But then that that surely d depends a little on the T_V_ because some T_V_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the T_V_'s ability to to change channels . Or do you have to go through and you wait for it ? You scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to
B :  Sure .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Well I think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it's maybe you know a digital
B :  wheel , right , where it's where it's quantized into you know certain
A :  Mm .
D :  Oh yeah .
A :  Uh I see I see . That's where you
D :  Yeah .
B :  That was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be .
A :  Ah I see I see what you're talking about now . Okay .
B :  It's just it's basically it it's just a f look and feel thing . It has the same exact functionality as two buttons .
D :  I I think there's you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers , and I see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . Instead of going button-to-bu you just j you'd j j j j j j . I really I really think that's a really cool thing for surfing .
A :  Yeah if you're just sitting there going
B :  Yeah .
A :  That's kinda cool actually . I like that .
B :  Now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of T_V_s won't re the T_V_s won't respond exactly the same . Some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip .
D :  Well there's ano
B :  But
A :  Well not n necessarily . You could basically make it so that it'll I mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the T_V_ yeah the T_V_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once . If you do that .
B :  Right .
D :  That's right .
B :  Yeah it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , but I think once people get used to it I I do like the idea of the scroll wheel though .
A :  Other than click click click .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And if we're marketing it as a high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good T_V_s as well , yeah , presumably .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah I think so . I I think so . Now the the only thing I I on the interface side of it , is that I I I see the dilemma .
A :  Primarily .
C :  Yep .
D :  But if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . So I can go uh presuming I have , on my television , something that tells me what channel I'm on , I can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I know what because it's on the television . The television tells me what channel it's on when I change it . So I don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem , 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . Okay ? So ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? You understand what I'm saying ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I think I know what you might be getting at , or or
A :  Oh I see so if maybe if we had an L_C_D_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ?
D :  Oh no we could read it from the television .
A :  And then it that basically
B :  Well , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , and it c it
A :  Mm .
A :  Well that's quite cool . You'd need a display on the th the thing .
B :  Why ? It'll tell you when you flip the channel on the T_V_ .
D :  Yeah the the television can tell you . Can .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Oh yeah yeah no I see what you're talking about . Yeah that's kinda cool . How would you program it though ?
B :  Well you just it's one extra button . You say programme start , and then type in 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually . So programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end .
D :  Put
A :  Okay okay .
D :  And then .
A :  Okay and yeah and that just basically flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again . Yeah that's kinda cool . I like that .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And again we have another another great marketing tool . We have about three we have three or four things here .
A :  That's not gonna be too expensive because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . You could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I dunno and an maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology . This may be something that's available through our own uh through our own services .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Might be , but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature . The problem we're gonna have is making it robust .
B :  Oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two .
A :  Making it last .
D :  Or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other .
A :  So if there's a button for each type .
B :  No because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels .
A :  Yeah people are gonna have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they
D :  Ah-ha okay .
D :  Okay , okay , well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch .
B :  Right .
B :  I think we'll need a we'll need a mode switch , but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator
A :  Yeah yeah the mode switch .
A :  Just the lights behind the buttons . You could have back-lit buttons maybe .
B :  to which , an L_E_ an L_E_D_ okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Would that work ? Is that okay we have five minutes . So right details th that we've talked about here are that we want a scroll wheel .
B :  Okay .
A :  We want a mode indicator .
A :  We want back-lit buttons .
A :  And if we're making back-lit buttons period , do we want that just for the mode indicator or maybe to indicate what button you're pressing at the time , so that you know if it's actually pressed or not . I've seen some remotes do that .
B :  Okay . Just so you know I think I mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range . It seems we're kind of approaching a higher-end range . I wanna make sure everybody's okay with that .
D :  Yeah yeah .
A :  I think we are yeah .
D :  Well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this . Didn't you say so ?
A :  Yeah well we don't have it's not that we have more money , we can push up the the price . Yeah .
D :  That's what I mean . We can increase the cost .
B :  Okay .
D :  So I don't know I don't know whether having
A :  'Kay .
B :  I just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it . So
A :  Yeah .
A :  So we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components . But I'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , and what sorta price can we make it for ?
D :  Well I think th I think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit .
A :  Yeah no I I think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand . We're entering a new market here , so I think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to
B :  Right .
D :  Okay I'm I'm okay with that . I guess what I just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , and then we have to take this to the next level .
A :  But th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ?
B :  Well y yeah . Let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for with all these features how much would you pay if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your T_V_ remote , how much would you pay for that ?
D :  We have to find cost .
A :  But you've gotta think who our target market is because I I'm not our target market . I'm a student , but
B :  I'm just asking you .
B :  If
A :  on the other hand I would think ,
A :  mm with my Project Manager salary , I would think yeah I could probably afford this uh would I buy it ? Maybe . If I had a cool new T_V_ and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which I think's a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little . Then maybe you know . I do I don't think I'd go over a hundred Euro certainly , that would be way too much , but the I would be happy paying over forty for it , I guess , but not much
B :  Then you could probably afford this .
B :  Oh no no .
B :  I would say thirty five to forty .
D :  Yeah , I was gonna say thirty five to fifty .
A :  'Kay . Thirty five to fifty Euros is our sales bracket okay . So the question is what we ca we make it for .
B :  Okay .
D :  Because one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television . It's one of the marketing features in this .
B :  Right .
A :  Mm .
A :  That's why the scroll needs to be really robust .
C :  Okay so we'll come up with something between thirty five and fifty that is rug rubber , robust , with scroll wheel , with the new facilities of the scroll wheel like favourite stuff , favourite channels , and and with a cradle , and yeah and the locator .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  With a cradle , radio transmitters ,
B :  and back-lit buttons . And it's gonna look sexy .
C :  Or not .
B :  Or not . It might look like clay .
C :  Okay so you can market pe depending on that ?
D :  Yeah yeah . Bas th that's that's easy . That's that's not a , it's a .
D :  'Cause we have about six , six , seven features in that alone .
A :  Yep .
C :  Cool .
D :  Under the title of uniquenesses .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay . The next meeting starts in thirty minutes , although does it ? It starts at three twenty one , the next meeting . So we've got more than a thirty minutes . Um we've got more like fifty .
D :  Well I have
D :  Is my three twenty one is the next meeting ?
A :  The the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah .
D :  That's that's almost uh fifty minutes .
A :  Yeah that is . Uh they've they've changed the times from the presentations .
D :  You guys can
D :  You guys you guys can uh create a
D :  All kinds of things .
B :  Probably . We'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier .
D :  Thanks , yeah .
A :  Okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do , look like , how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail ?
B :  I don't think so . If we have any questions we'll just email you I guess .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah I think it pretty much everything's covered .
A :  Okay . This one was quite easy .
C :  Coulda been worse .
D :  Still .
A :  Always the optimist . 'Kay thanks guys .
C :  Yes I am .
D :  Thank you .
D :  I don't have any emails . This means I can go home .
D :  Oh , we all leave .
C :  So , I will open our functional design meeting .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So , I will play role of the secretary .
C :  As also Program Ma Manager . So , we will have the three presentations from the
C :  In Industrial Designer , User Interface Designer and um
B :  Industrial Design .
A :  Marketing Expert .
C :  What's your talk ? Marketing Experts .
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  And after that we uh will have the
C :  new product requirements ,
C :  the decision on the remote control functions ,
C :  and we will
C :  close the meetings after .
C :  Mm so
C :  um I suppose the first to do the presentation will be the User Interface Designer .
D :  Okay .
C :  Um , so you're participant two ?
B :  One one .
D :  No no no .
C :  No you're
D :  One .
C :  No , I'm participant one .
B :  Three three , it's three sorry .
D :  I I think I'm a .
C :  Okay , never mind .
A :  Okay .
C :  'Kay , did you save your presentation ?
D :  In one .
B :  In one , sorry .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Isn't that technical functions ?
A :  No sure .
B :  So you didn't save it maybe .
D :  It's mine .
A :  Uh it's David Jordan . Course .
B :  Alright , so
C :  Name's Jordan .
B :  David Jordan ? Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  so I'll
C :  I let David Jordan do his presentation .
D :  Okay .
A :  No , no .
A :  Uh this one doesn't want to be moved , I think .
C :  Uh .
B :  Too great for email then .
D :  Okay , so .
D :  The first I will present the technical function design for user interface for our uh remote T_V_ control .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh I I will focus on user interface design . Um so move to the next slide . As we know our
C :  Mm .
D :  remote c rem remote T_V_ control it's very has very soph sophisticated functions , as we show from this picture .
D :  There's a lot of functions .
D :  Over , I think over
D :  s twelve or twenty s functions of a remote T_V_ control .
D :  So how can we
D :  um design a user interface with so sa with so many sophisticated functions ?
D :  Um , let's move to next slide .
D :  Um .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So I so we want to design uh elegant , easy to use inter interface .
D :  A very good example is Google . As we know uh Google it's a very successful because his um powerful function , but with very easy to use user interface .
D :  Um so move to next s slide .
D :  So my job is to uh design a Google T_V_ controller
D :  which I want to have sophisticated functions while with very easy to use user interface .
D :  So
D :  That's the end of the talk the end of the presentation .
C :  So you propose to to have the
C :  remote control which will be powerful .
D :  Uh
D :  With sophisticated functions , but with very yeah powerful .
C :  So powerful ,
C :  many functions and very easy to use .
D :  Yes .
D :  Yep .
A :  So , I dunno , it's maybe difficult to have both , I mean the the one on the right doesn't look so simple and
B :  To merge the two system huh .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  You mean this one ? Yeah you have to learn the manual before using this remote control , I suppose .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm yep .
B :  But But this is
D :  But if we have very very good user interface
B :  Yeah .
D :  it take less time for user to learn how to use it .
A :  Yeah , and then
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah you maybe you have some international standards , where you know , if you can use one is the other are or almost the same , so the sign .
C :  Oh you mean for the yeah pic pictograms or things like that ?
B :  Yeah , yeah . For example , I dunno here , escape , you know , you have escape in computers you have , so if you see escape , you know that it should be the same . So you have to The sh the user there for example the power off button it is something very international , you know that
A :  Oh it should okay , yeah . The user should know .
B :  So .
C :  Yeah um such as maybe the
B :  Yeah . So .
C :  Go on , go back and
B :  Yeah , but the question is how to merge you know the Google system to the system , alright .
A :  Yeah , that's gonna be the trick .
D :  Yeah , that's my job .
B :  That's your job
D :  That's my job . It's not the easiest I've got to .
B :  It you
C :  So , you will propose us something which is
C :  yeah so powerful and easy to use . Okay .
D :  Yep .
D :  Powerful and easy to use .
A :  Okay .
A :  So that's the point .
D :  Yeah , that's the point .
C :  So , next I propose the Industrial User Interface to present things .
B :  Okay , okay .
C :  So you you're
B :  Participant two .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Um . Okay .
B :  The rationale must be design , or
C :  So , Baba is the uh the Industrial
C :  Designer .
C :  Okay .
B :  So we can move to the next slide . As you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh
B :  to give an industrial design of the remote control . So the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , so the problem is how to relate the
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one I h I'm holding in my hand and the T_V_ . So , this one is leather bu based but
A :  Mm .
B :  I propose a nifra infrared base you know , so so for me I think that it is better it's bet it's better to control T_V_ so you know , so it's it will be cheaper and it is less technology than , you know
B :  For the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to
A :  True .
C :  So you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ?
B :  I think it's cheaper than laser , so .
C :  Yeah . Do y you know the requirements for the remote control ?
A :  Okay .
C :  Twelve , nearly thirteen , yeah . The cost
A :  What the cost is ? Twelve , twelve a half .
B :  Yeah , I think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh
B :  Let's see . Yeah . You can move to the next slide , so . So the di the differen the findings you know what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , so here for example the infrared bulb will be here and the bulb it will be somewhere inside .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  That might just So .
B :  You can go to the next slide . I have some kind of pictures
C :  Okay .
B :  you know , here .
B :  You have the b the bulb , it is a blue the blue stuff here and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff you know and so and you have the other subcomponent that are not really here so important , so .
C :  Yeah .
C :  What is this ?
B :  This is in fact some other component that are in between the electrical de the electronic device .
C :  Okay .
B :  Look .
B :  But here what I wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and .
C :  Okay .
B :  So and the next slide , it is the last one it's So it's
B :  I think it should be wire wireless re remote con
B :  Because you know , it's easier to manage and you know
B :  because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you .
B :  Or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , but you know , I at my side prefer a wireless .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay , so if you have some question I didn't answer ?
A :  Okay .
A :  What's the average price of this technology then ?
B :  Well the avera the average prices I think that this technology will cost , I dunno , around eight Euros , so . Or at least you know , the
D :  So what , the wireless remote control ? There's a wire with remote control ?
B :  You'd yes , you can . It's so so bres you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , so you can think about wireless or you know it's it's a question that we can raise , so . We can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . We can have both also .
D :  Okay .
C :  So you think that uh
C :  a cable between the remote control and the T_V_ won't be a good idea . No it wou maybe it will be cheaper I dunno , I just may maybe you making a solu
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  But this is what you would like to ask the user first and I don't think the user would be ready to have a
C :  Yeah , but
D :  Wireless remote control .
B :  Yeah , but some pa
A :  I don't think well , yeah , I don't think he would , but in a sense
B :  I always want to have you know , sometime I want to have wire because you know .
C :  Yeah but as Industrial Designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? I'm just asking you . Do you think it will be cheaper ?
B :  Uh , I don't think it will be too much .
D :  Okay .
C :  Could you answer please ?
B :  Have to think about the question , you know , 'cause it's I think that you know you can always you know
C :  Okay .
B :  I think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper but you know the wireless it's more practical , so .
C :  Yeah , but I think the wireless problem is more the um David Jordan's problem . As it's yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  The wire ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  True .
C :  I think it's more your problem . Mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not .
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh that's my job . That's the
C :  Okay , I'm sorry . So
A :  Now the
B :  Yeah but , it should be an agreement , you know , because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the g Graphical User Designer , but you know .
B :  If it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some
B :  the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless , it it is a question . Right , so .
D :  Okay .
C :  So just think of um the usability . Yeah . Just think of the problem . If when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ?
D :  Design a wireless remote control .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , yeah .
A :  Well that's actually one of the point , yeah ? True . This you will see in my presentation then .
C :  So I will let you to do your presentation , so .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Which is participant four .
A :  So just trying to answer all the questions , if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh .
A :  We've made a study , so could you go to next slide . Sorry for the functional recurrence . So that's the standard method for marketing , okay . We had one hundred subjects , um , we observe their remote control use in a lab and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um ,
A :  and see what was okay or not for them . Okay . So then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , okay , so that's
C :  You mean the loo the look , the outside ? Okay .
B :  The look , how it look like .
A :  Yeah , the the look is is bad for them so uh it's your job , David , maybe .
A :  Then eighty percent of users would spend more money um
A :  actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . So this is where we could have uh
A :  yeah , good market , I guess , if people are ready to pay more .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So it's it's interesting information , I think . And then um
A :  yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously
A :  it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , because it's too many buttons and so on . So we should change this as well . And uh
A :  users are actually zapping a lot , so they're using the device intensively , that's something to take into account as well . And um , you know , ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control .
A :  And uh this is one of the main point for me . But I'll come back to it later .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Could you go next slide ?
A :  Uh , so as you said uh , remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So this is from the experiments we've done , so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , I think .
A :  Um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people .
A :  And uh remote control are really bad for R_S_I_ problems for twenty six percent of the users .
C :  What is R_S_I_ ?
A :  R_S_I_ is like , when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . Okay ? So , those numbers are less important then the previous one , but still it has to be taken to count . So last slide .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Ah um okay .
A :  Um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . If we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , okay . And definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , this would definitely be a good way of selling more . Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Functions .
B :  Okay .
A :  So
C :  Mm okay .
C :  And just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the
C :  User Interface Designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? Sure ? Yeah ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think possible . Because we can
D :  We can uh
D :  mix uh several function in one button .
D :  So lets you then you have less buttons . But I'm not sure
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , but do you think it will be easy to use ? Because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know .
A :  Yeah , remember the user is not happy to read the
C :  Yeah , I think the
B :  The manuals .
A :  manual . It's
D :  No you you can have a switch menu , so you can
D :  well for example
C :  Yeah , but it has to be intuitive .
D :  Yeah , I think so . Like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . Then
D :  for um you can have a switch menu , so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . Then you you put the switch button , then it
C :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Okay , but
D :  switch to another category of functions .
D :  Yeah .
D :  For example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your T_V_ and also you can control your uh recorder .
B :  With a
D :  So there's a different functions , but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control T_V_ and control your recorder .
D :  So we can has less buttons . But what I'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny . Because different people have a different opinion about fancy . You know .
C :  Yeah , but
B :  Look fancy .
B :  This is a question that should be asked to the
B :  If you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples , so .
A :  Yeah , this is something we sh
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But this was first step and
B :  I think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard
A :  This was the first step , yeah .
C :  Yeah , but I think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control .
A :  Specially distribution , yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , maybe . Yeah , maybe .
C :  If you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more .
A :  Uh
D :  Yeah , personalised colour . Because you know
C :  Yeah , it will cost little bit more .
D :  Yeah , because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , some people prefer black remote control .
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah , but this is what we would ask to the users , so .
C :  And also f
D :  Maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , so user can select which colour they prefer , so .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , and we don't really want the price to be too too high , because we wanna be able to produce it .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , remember it's twelve Euros .
C :  So , we want something fancy , as uh previously said , Florent , something very easy to use , powerful and also as uh it's written here , seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Hmm .
C :  And they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , they want to zap between channels on T_V_ .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So
C :  I think you have quite lot of points to to think about and to discuss it with uh the other members .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , hmm .
C :  So , is it okay for your presentation ? Nothing else to to add ?
A :  Yeah , it's done , just yeah . If we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , I think it would make it .
C :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
C :  Mm so
C :  So , I had some
A :  So .
C :  new information about the product requirements , so you will have to
C :  take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . So the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , as it's something that's
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  It's is uh
A :  Lame , or
C :  No yeah , because now everybody has internet at home , so it's better to use internet then teletext .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So , you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , and also the remote control will only be used for television , so
B :  Yep .
C :  for y for you your designing , you're not you won't be uh you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . It's because if we want to
D :  Control .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  to do remote control
D :  Mm .
C :  which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex and it will increase the pli the price and we can't do that . We really want to focus on the remote control for the television . Is it okay ?
D :  Okay . But there's balance between function and the cost .
C :  So maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . And also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . I mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hm .
C :  So you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
C :  of the uh of real reaction
D :  Okay .
C :  and uh also
B :  So .
A :  So has to be yellow .
C :  Yeah . As we say , we put the fashion in electronics , so it has to be a fashion remote control . Fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use .
B :  Yellow .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Require lot of requirements , but
D :  Yeah .
B :  For cheap remote control , yeah .
D :  And cheap . A low cost .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But uh that's your your job to find something mm matches .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , 'cause what I'm thinking is how will you will connect the T_V_ to internet , so .
B :  This is
A :  I don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway . It's maybe more in browsing .
C :  Maybe not , but mayb
B :  Yeah , but this this mean that your T_V_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web .
D :  Yeah , there's that box in uh o of it . A pi There's that box in the T_V_ , so with the set box you you can connect internet with your T_V_ .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Hm-mm .
D :  It's It's not so uh popular now .
B :  It's pop I don't think it's popular , so that's the problem so . You had i if you are designing a remote control for you know
D :  Mm .
D :  Global , okay .
B :  the global usage , so if people don't have the technology .
C :  So .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So I I so
C :  So everybody is okay with the new requirements ?
D :  As as for the colour , what what do you think ?
C :  I think it has to be yellow .
B :  Yellow ? Do you think that people like the colour yellow ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yellow ? T_V_ remote control ?
C :  Maybe you can change the colour , but the image of the society has to be recognised .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double R_ . Or should be . Yeah , so . Doesn't need to be completely yellow , but just mm .
C :  Why you go
C :  It has to be fashion .
D :  Okay .
C :  So you have to
C :  Yeah . It has to be a fashion and really be uh the image of the society . Just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . Think it's a re reaction remote control , so . And also it has to be attractive , of course , because if you want to sale to sell the remote control .
D :  Okay , okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
C :  It's okay ?
A :  Regarding the first line , what
A :  So we're just expecting no more use of the teletext .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And that's it .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But I dunno , but why , nobody's a threat to me .
A :  It's already changed for
C :  I think it would be simpler .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  So
C :  I will close the meeting , um just after that we'll have lunch break .
C :  And you will have in thirty minutes individual work .
C :  Uh
C :  Y you
C :  You will have as the I_D_ I don't remember what is industr Industrial Designer to put um pon yeah , and the User Interface Designer to work on the user interface concept .
B :  Industrial Designer , yeah .
A :  Industrial Designer .
B :  Component component , yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  And Florent to
C :  work my subject . And so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay .
C :  It's okay ? I think the um session is closed .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Good .
C :  And by the way , Mister David Jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . Not in mine . Should be better .
B :  Okay Okay , that's clear .
D :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Okay everybody is ready ? Good morning again . So , today we are going to have a f second meeting . Oh Michael , hi . You're late . You have a good reason for that ? Very good . Okay , let's have a look to the agenda today .
B :  Yep .
B :  Yes .
A :  So , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design . Um so first before starting I w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting .
A :  So uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , but I have new um new i inputs for about that topics . I goin I'm going to share with you .
A :  And uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you uh so um Industrial Designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design . You showed us you ar you you prepare something for us ?
C :  Yep .
C :  Yeah . Yep .
A :  The U_I_ guy also uh work on that , yeah , and for the mar our Marketing Expert should deliver some specs .
B :  Mm .
A :  Alright so so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . But first I would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project . So , I just put d quickly Remo , but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly . Any ideas ?
B :  Uh the Powerstick .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Powerstick , yeah .
A :  What else ?
A :  What else ?
D :  Uh .
B :  Maybe a Spanish name would work well . Especially if we're selling into the U_S_ market becasue there's a lot of Spanish speakers there .
D :  Mm I was thinking of the
B :  Maybe something that sounds cool in English but sounds funny in Spanish . Mando . What is that ?
D :  Mando .
A :  Mango ? Mango ? Mando . M_A_ ?
D :  Mando .
A :  M_A_ ?
D :  A_N_ yeah D_O .
A :  M_ D_O_ . Mm , okay .
D :  It doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me , but maybe for a Spanish for I for
A :  What does it mean ?
A :  Oh .
B :  What does it mean in Spanish ?
D :  Control .
B :  Control . Okay . 'Cause it also like in English it sounds like you know the man's tool you know because you know men like to have control of the remote so it might
A :  Hmm . Nice .
D :  But mm , yeah . Mando sounds
D :  Latino .
A : 
B :  The Mando .
A :  Okay .
A :  So , let's go for Mando ?
A :  Yeah ? No objection ?
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah that's . And we could have some like you d you could have the fonts you know special , so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the O_ as like
A :  Great . So
A :  Okay , I think this is
B :  Although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though , do you ? So
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah they are the most T_V_ watcher . So we should be careful .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , I think this is more a question of of I I think this is more a question of of look and feel . Something that should be addressed later . We should we should go to other for the other topics .
D :  But yeah it uh
B :  Marketing .
D :  Yeah because if the product will be international
B :  Well that's the thing . We need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a
A :  Yeah okay , so let's stick f to Man Mando for the name and we'll see for the for the look and feel later . So let's go for the three presentations right now . So , who want to start ?
B :  Um .
D :  Maybe maybe I should uh start . Yeah .
A :  So maybe we could start with the market , yeah .
D :  Mm . Okay .
A :  Okay so I have your slides somewhere ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Should be in participant four .
A :  Participant four .
A :  This one ?
D :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Uh .
A :  S that's coming . Uh okay . Great .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yep .
D :  Okay so yeah I will I will give a brief outline about what I what I prepared for this meeting .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  For the functional requirements and especially for the
D :  for the user requirements . I prepare a marketing report and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls .
D :  And also I di I did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five , ten years . There is no
D :  no significant difference
D :  between the the b the first new controls and
A :  Okay . Sh next slide ? Okay .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . So and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , which is which is good and it's interesting point .
D :  Also the people are worried about about the R_S_I_ disease , which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old .
D :  So s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control . They are also they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , so I think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And also I found that young people the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control .
A :  Okay .
D :  So in my opinion the
D :  Mando this Mando shouldn't be very small because the smaller it is , the more like the the liklier it is to get lost . Liklier or more likely ? likely . Okay .
B :  More likely .
D :  Uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often but
D :  they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control . Also the z the design should fit the hand shape . So it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes , for right and left handed people .
B :  Well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . So
B :  unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe
D :  Yeah .
B :  cut out some a lot of your market .
D :  I dunno I th Anyway I think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls . Sorry ?
C :  Well maybe it could be a universal design . A universal design , which is which is good for both the hands . Yeah ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ?
C :  That's right , whether it's left hand or right hand , but but don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Sorry ?
C :  The first and the third point , they are clashing .
B :  Well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . So fitting the hand doesn't mean much then .
D :  Like uh
B :  Uh .
B :  Well it means like , this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something .
C :  Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , like
C :  Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . So it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ? Little sleek , longer ?
C :  And it should fit the hand .
D :  No no I was thinking of so like something yeah .
A :  Something with the shape of the palm ?
C :  Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .
B :  Some finger grips maybe . You could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything , but
D :  Yeah .
A :  On the sides .
D :  Yeah yeah . It sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical . Not anymore . That's what yeah .
C :  Mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm .
A :  And then finally
D :  And finally , the incorporation of a L_C_D_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , but I don't know if the budget
B :  Yeah .
D :  would be large enough .
A :  Yeah . First I'm just wondering about the L_C_D_ stuff because uh because
D :  But most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology .
A :  Yeah , so maybe it's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations . We had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company , and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to T_V_ .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , I dunno if you had this information already . No , so they want us to restrict the remote control to T_V_ only because of time limitations . Um they want also uh
B :  No .
D :  Actually this marketing report is restricted to T_V_ remote controls .
A :  Excellent . So we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now
A :  and uh finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product .
B :  I was still uh I was still working on this uh twenty five Euro price point because I think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price if if we're maybe I can get to this in my presentation though , but um yeah .
A :  So
A :  Yeah yeah . Sure sure . So maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now . Okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about L_C_D_ and speech uh reco
B :  Yep . Okay .
B :  Yeah . I think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult because if you think if you're watching T_V_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the T_V_ which might interfere with the
A :  Sorry , what is your ?
B :  Uh participant three .
B :  You might have some background noise from the T_V_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so .
D :  Yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , so yeah yeah . Yeah uh channel fifty .
B :  Oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the T_V_ the T_V_ sound turns off .
D :  Yeah .
C :  No it could be command control kind of thing . It requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated .
C :  Means you say you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition . Because this kind of thing means speech is there from the T_V_ also . So there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop . It's like V_I_ editor , you are having two modes similarly . Otherwise it's just lying idle .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
A :  Okay Michael .
B :  Okay , so , could I describe the mouse maybe be easier to could I use the mouse , or
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Um yeah .
B :  Mm . Thanks .
B :  Okay .
A :  The wheel doesn't work .
B :  Great . Okay so um while uh researching this this topic I first of all just thought of a couple of things that I would like to see in a remote , and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on Epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site .
B :  So um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , but it's not really it's by no means uh
B :  mm you know on it's own in being so expensive . There are a lot of expensive remote controls out there . So yeah it doe it's well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the L_C_D_ screen except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons .
A :  Looks like a P_D_A_ ?
B :  Um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , I know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these L_C_D_ screens which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices I suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times .
B :  But um the thing that I find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , which I think is it's a really kind of important design aspect um is it's
B :  'Cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . And obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel . Now um
C :  Change the channels . Yeah .
B :  uh the I think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . 'Cause I know when I um when I use the remote to change the channel I very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . I usually use the up and down because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , so that's just uh it's annoying . So I think a scroll wheel is is quite handy .
C :  Mmm-hmm mm-hmm . Yeah yeah .
B :  Now um the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an L_C_D_ screen , and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  One possibility , if we now we need to still talk about the price point because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five Eu uh Euro , but
B :  one possibility is to download program information into the L_C_D_ screen so that instead of actually saying I want to I want to go to channel thirty seven because I know this programme's on , you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . If you have a list of of programs on your L_C_D_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel .
B :  So if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . So this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have , but um we we really need t to discuss the price .
B :  So , I mean there are there are uh cheaper this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . So this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on Epinions .
B :  It it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible um because really I think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control .
B :  And was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , but I think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . So if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want . So
C :  But there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality . Because the same button is doing too many things .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah well we w
B :  Yeah well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . Um I think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I I would if I had my perfect remote control , I'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way . They don't really do anything . Maybe you know I although I do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good . Um but I think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  H I think I think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional
C :  It does sampling out of the .
B :  Well I guess that depends on how you market it . If you if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy .
D :  If y
A :  Okay , can you continue , please Mi ?
B :  So , but yep . Um okay , so , I think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . So if we can have a higher priced uh remote control I think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing .
B :  Um mm there's the L_C_D_ screen , um which maybe maybe is too expensive , um but I think also at the scroll wheel , I haven't mentioned it here , the scroll wheel could be used without an L_C_D_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . I think even that , I mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an L_C_D_ screen , to implement , um but I think that would be quite useful as well .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , but I think one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology , and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks . Say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room .
B :  You know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , but , you know , later on you could you can you know you also , selling the potential of the device . Then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , I dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , and um , I think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Okay , thanks .
A :  you want to go ?
C :  Yep . So yeah .
C :  So most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , that means on my own I yeah , it should be .
A :  This one ?
A :  Great . No , not that one .
A :  you are two .
C :  Two .
A :  Alright .
C :  Okay so the working design is uh user i interface could be of two types , one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology . So he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote . So the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can
C :  it can be useful for them , and the new users , as uh our Marketing Expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing .
A :  Okay , sorry to interrupt you , but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel .
C :  That's right . So anyway , that didn't come into my mind , so th that is a possibility . These could be other kind of interfaces . Means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . So spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with . So if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is , and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five Euros money which we are thinking .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Otherwise we are just like others in the market . So anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually . So apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . Now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . And for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote .
A :  Yeah . That increases the the cost also .
C :  Uh that's right . But uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that .
A :  Do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ?
C :  Uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc
A :  Well wh uh I imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control . So it could be s a few centimetres .
B :  Hmm .
C :  That's right .
C :  No it it could be little d yeah it could be
B :  Well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though , because , I'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but I presume it's not gonna just be English speaking countries . So then you have to s you know , you have to train models for
C :  That's right . That's right .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
C :  Uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing so D_T_W_ could be kind of which is the easiest . So you have to store some templates on the on the
C :  on the chip itself , and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide . This is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion . Okay , next . Uh that finished ?
C :  Yeah , that's right .
C :  Yeah . So we can
C :  That's right . Yep .
C :  Yep .
C :  No no . Components . Yeah . So , will you go to the next slide ? Yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . We are having a power button and the switch , which is not much , and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . And then there are two kind of things which can be so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time . So we could not put that . So now where the A_S_R_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there .
A :  No ? Components ?
A :  Yes sure .
C :  So there is A_S_R_ decoder which could be there , and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , and then there could be buttons , and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . And then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver .
A :  Okay .
C :  So this is the easiest design the there could be . So th an A_S_R_ decoder we can have things in .
C :  To have different technologies . So this was the my personal preference was that we can have A_S_R_ sitting there on the remote control . Yeah .
B :  You know I guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing
C :  Yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up . So these are the slight problems .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So your
A :  your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ?
C :  Because yeah the reason is that if we go into the market means though I don't have much idea , but as he the uh Marketing Expert presentation was
D :  I'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five Euros everyo everyone will s will buy it .
B :  Actually I'm not so sure because I'm the you know if I was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because I can't hear it very well , I don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when I'm when I'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control . You know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that I can't hear , I'm trying to actually find out what's being said , so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps .
C :  So if we go with just the
D :  I'm sure .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay so
D :  Yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about
B :  Well it depends if it's a remote control th
D :  it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that .
B :  Maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion . If you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be .
C :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now . Um so if I if I kind of summarise everything we've de we we said . We are targeting T_V_ .
C :  Alright .
A :  We need we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . Um we have or good shape , yes . We should bring new technologies for young peoples , and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . Maybe this is something we can stick to it .
D :  With a good shape for the
A :  And um also , a very interesting things I I I've seen on on on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . So so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to L_C_D_
A :  and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . Uh first m m why not to go to L_C_D_ . Because um in fact as we are targeting uh T_V_ in fact we can use T_V_ screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have .
B :  Well it depends though well it depends . If we we don't unless we have some input some video input to the T_V_ or we have control over the T_V_ then we can't actually display that . Like if we if we produce the T_V_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the T_V_ to superimpose those those menus . So that's an extra
A :  Yeah that's right . Don don't you ha don't we have contacts with uh people on T_V_ or or well systems that exist that we can use ?
B :  cost .
B :  Well this is this is another que we still haven't really defined the remote . Are we still you say we're focusing on T_V_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ? 'Cause that really makes a big difference . 'Cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' T_V_s . It's just there are too many T_V_s out there . It's it's not really gonna
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . That's good point . What's what cou what could be the cost of uh well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to L_C_D_ on the remote control ?
B :  For twenty five Euro ? I think it's impossible . But but I dunno , I think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five Euro because for twenty five Euro I think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . So I would I would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh
A :  Yeah .
C :  It's not possible . It's impossible .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Uh
B :  of increasing the unit price .
D :  What would be
A :  So you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um in terms to had to have really an added value ? Okay , so regarding the automatic speech recognition , I think this is
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah because yeah .
D :  Wha but what would be one question , what would be the goal of putting an L_C_D_ in a remote control ?
B :  Well th
D :  What what kind of information ?
B :  'Cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide .
D :  Yeah but mo most of the T_V_s nowadays show the show the
A :  They have tele teletext .
A :  Well , because they have teletext on it . Th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel .
D :  the n
D :  Yeah but yeah most of the T_V_s have teletext nowadays .
A :  They have t most of them have teletext , but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet . So to to uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  You can get a lot more information on it .
A :  to browse more easily the teletext .
A :  For instance through uh through your remote control .
D :  So what would what would appear in the in the L_C_D_ ?
B :  So you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to .
A :  The ti the start time , all the p all the programmes you could have uh o
B :  You could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something so you can quickly just kind of even without reading
D :  Okay .
A :  Well I don't know if this information is available from teletext , also .
B :  Well no , but there are the electronic programme guides out there . They may not have pictures , but maybe they do . There's dependi it also depends on the country .
C :  Are
A :  Well because for the same reason that we cannot
A :  uh informations on the T_V_ . We c we couldn't grab information information which is not there .
B :  No but I mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . So it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . Uh .
A :  So so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the T_V_ , or uh or it should be a special T_V_ connected to
D :  But
D :  Yeah .
B :  Well I I think if we're gonna I think we would definitely need the internet connection because even with y I don't think you could even get teletext information from the T_V_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the T_V_ . I dunno . We need to find that out .
A :  Okay . We need to close the meeting . Um so
C :  But just a small thing , what kind of market we are targeting ? Is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? So the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or because the cost of L_C_D_ thing could be as high as the T_V_ itself . That is very important .
A :  Very quickly .
A :  No . Yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their , and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have . So this is that we z that that we should target .
B :  Mm . If it's a really small T_V_ maybe .
C :  Broke . Okay . Okay .
C :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Okay . Okay .
A :  So the com the um the uh the committment is the following , we don't go for speech recognition technology . The L_C_D_ is still on disc is still open to discussion . It is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . So
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the L_C_D_ .
C :  It's it's cheaper as compared to the L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah , but not sure . Maybe it's cheaper , but we have no
D :  Because with the L_C_D_ you need more requirements . You need a internet connection . You need m more things . But
D :  for the speech recognition you you don't need anything . You just say channel fifty , and that's it .
B :  Well the thing is I think I think the type of peop
B :  I think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a you know .
D :  But then we should move to another target b because at twenty five Dollars , it's
C :  Means th yeah twenty five Euros is yeah , that's right .
B :  Well this is what we need to find out . Can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? 'Cause otherwise we need
A :  Okay this is this is an open question for you .
A :  Yeah . This is uh up to you to tell us . But I'm definitely not keen on to to no no no , I'm no I'm definit definitely not keen on going to speech recognition technologies . I'm not confident enough . I'm not sure that that we'll have a product really that work . I uh that work
D :  To move to another target ?
B :  It's kind of hard to guarantee that you're gonna
A :  It's real yeah . How to guarantee such performances is really hard .
D :  the expert uh said ninety five percent .
B :  Ninety five percent is not good enough though .
A :  Well this is still is is very bad . So , this is the end of this discussion . Next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on . Um so you have to work on the component uh concept . Uh you have to work on user interface , and you have to go through a trend watching .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay . So the question is still open about the L_C_D_ thing .
A :  Um uh we I hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction . Thanks . Bye .
B :  Yep .
A :  So um nice to see you again . Uh . So , uh .
A :  Tod uh for this meeting I will take the notes and do the minutes .
A :  Uh so we will see our three presentations .
A :  Um we will start with the uh Manager Expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device .
D :  Okay , can I have the laptop over here , or ? Okay . Have to get up .
A :  Yep . Oh , I don't think so . I think you have to come here .
A :  I dunno .
A :  I think it should stay .
D :  Excuse me . Okay .
B :  Yeah , that's it .
A :  Should stay in the square here .
D :  Okay .
A :  Oh , maybe .
D :  Okay , so basically I'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . Um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . Um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls .
A :  Oh , you can put it here . Oh that's okay , it's jus
D :  So basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . Um they , you know , seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . Completely ugly . Um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching T_V_ . Um , that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it . Um and
D :  thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . Um so we collect we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . And from this we basically came up with the figure that
D :  the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control . Um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching T_V_ . Um the closest button that was used , well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , um which was used fourteen times per hour , followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um ,
D :  all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . Um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control .
D :  And basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . Um and the audio and picture settings had a very that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um , and they used them very infrequently a as well .
D :  So we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . And
D :  fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . Um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . Um and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury .
D :  We also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control . In particular , do they want an L_C_D_ d display , and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control . Um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . They want these features , they want these high technology features . Um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features .
D :  Whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . So I guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market . Um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um I think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . That's my dic that's my presentation . Thank you .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Thank you .
C :  Okay .
A :  So , um
A :  maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device . So uh Pet Peter , can you talk say something about that ?
B :  Well , okay , yeah . Yeah , but the user user interface is responsible .
A :  No .
C :  B you think uh I I'm User Interface Manager . Okay . Okay . If I could go there with this cable .
A :  Ah . Sorry , I'm Sorry . Sorry .
B :  Okay , so .
B :  You're scaring me with L_C_D_ man . And speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive .
D :  Yeah , it's true , but , you know , they're features that users want , so it's And our production cost of twelve fifty Euros per per unit is fairly high I think , so I think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  At least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally .
C :  Sh okay .
D :  It is true .
C :  Where's delete button ? Okay .
C :  Oh I'm sorry .
C :  Okay .
D :  That's the wrong one , I think .
A :  Yeah , it's still Bob Morris . Yeah you should have put yes .
C :  Oh . Presentation three ?
B :  Because you cancelled it .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh .
A :  Click on yes .
A :  yeah .
B :  Yep .
C :  Okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design . I will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . Okay , uh , first what is a remote control ? Simply it's a device , as you know , for uh , for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device . And the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . Uh i it has different blocks , different blocks . Uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands .
C :  And then inter then make uh these keyboard commands , uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands . And then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to uh r to realise the command .
C :  Okay , uh about what I found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control . They are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves . There are two different uh uh solutions I mean . This is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves .
B :  You still want me the presentation .
C :  And uh also as uh I understood , and uh I think it was a part of uh Bob , uh uh presentation , people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button . So for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , and showing o something on T_V_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control .
C :  And uh personal preferences , uh uh uh uh certainly a remote control with uh working with radio waves is uh preferred because uh you can pr you can take it in any direction and you don't need to tune it any way . And uh uh again , using bigger buttons and less number of buttons are also preferred , as I see . Okay . That was my presentation .
D :  Okay .
D :  I have a question .
C :  Uh-huh .
D :  Do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ?
C :  Uh , I don't think so , because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . So they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home .
D :  Okay .
A :  So can we use any any frequency ? We have the right to use any frequency ?
B :  Yeah , it should be okay .
C :  Uh no but as I know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit . We can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , and for this range we don't need to ask any permission .
A :  Okay . And what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? And so do they have the same frequency , or ?
C :  Uh for this I'm not uh I I don't know the solution , but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your T_V_ can understand it Yeah , identification code inside the
A :  Okay . A kind of identification , okay .
B :  Yeah f uh I know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . It's uh kind of handshaking , uh , when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your T_V_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . So so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the T_V_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . Well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay .
A :  So
A :  Yeah .
A :  So
A :  Okay .
C :  The password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem . A specific uh remote control has a specific f
B :  Yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this because I think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy . It's worth to buy . And they have these problems solved so . So we don't have to think about these .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . So , maybe you can talk about the function , and
D :  Okay .
B :  Yes . I have only a couple of things because I had I struggled a bit with the software that I'm supposed to use in this uh
B :  in this company . I was used to use Linux before , so . But I tried to
B :  tried to break through this too , I guess .
A :  Open .
B :  Mm . Ah .
B :  Okay .
B :  How to make it big ?
A :  Slide show .
C :  Five .
B :  Slide show . Okay , thanks .
A :  It should work , so you can .
B :  Okay . Oh so I will speak about working design . That's the first slide . Uh what uh I have to do ? A look at what the other company Okay so uh presently I am looking what is possible to use , what circuits to use and stuff like that because uh I didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far so I have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the I_R_ circuits and so on , so I'm currently looking what is available on the web . And uh I wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , so , I would be glad if you can tell me about them . So , you know .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh , okay findings , that's the point that I'm working on currently but uh so far I I was uh looking what what are the blue circuit , I mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , but the prices I read are high . So , I know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves because you can you can uh you can make the T_V_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , but you know , when you are not close to the T_V_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on and so I am I am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of R_W_ but we will discuss it later maybe .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Uh . Components to use , I'm not exactly sure what I will use for the design of the circuit . It depends uh on whether we will use the L_C_D_ and mainly the speech recognition , because the speech rec Yeah ?
D :  Are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an O_E_M_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ?
B :  No no no no no . This we this we buy I think , because it's rather cheap nowadays and it's not worth to construct ourselves .
D :  Okay s
D :  So we just buy a circuit board and Okay .
B :  Exactly .
B :  But I'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . This I prefer that we should make ourselves .
D :  Okay .
B :  But it depends whether we take a decision to use it . Same thing . It's fairly expensive to use these circuits . So , speech recognition well , L_C_D_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use L_C_D_ , so I agree on using any kind of L_C_D_ , less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . But the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? Or it would be maybe feasible ?
B :  Yeah , I'm
B :  Oh . I was not thinking too much about the price . But if we use the L_C_D_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the T_V_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . If we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle but we'll see afterwards . It depends of you if if the M_E_ or U_I_D_ , I'm sorry about the names , I don't really know , uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , it it depends on you not Because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . We will discuss it afterwards .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
B :  Oh , this is nothing . This is just my notes on what to use . And uh my personal preference is yes , I would like also preferably to use R_W_ circuit , but from the point of view uh of the design and price , I would stick to I_R_s . That's my opinion . Uh I mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency .
A :  Why ? Because it's simpler ?
B :  Because because the the range where you can use it is fair . It's okay I think . And the price is fairly cheap for this . Well , depends .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay . It's a a price matter .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Jus just the price . Otherwise I don't care what I put there because it's the chip which I buy or which we buy .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
B :  So I I I think it's o y o . Well , three to three to five . N not ten times , but it depends what what we
D :  What how much more expensive ? Are we talking three times more expensive ? Or ten times more expensive ? Or
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah yeah . That's still a lot . I think it's it's probably not worth spending the extra money , because I mean all the other remote controls on the market have infra-red , so people don't expect anything other than infra-red . So it's not worth spending the extra money .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well I , oh
B :  Yeah . Th they are used to use it when they can see the T_V_ so , I don't know .
D :  Yeah .
A :  On the other side , we want to have something new . You know , where
D :  Yeah .
A :  we want to
A :  to have something new and So we I think we should still thinking about it . But maybe .
D :  But I think , based on my usability studies I th I feel that users are prioritise the look and the feel and the trendiness above , you know , the difference between infra-red or radio waves . So I think we're better off spending money in the usability phase .
A :  Okay .
B :  You the user interface , and management man , uh
A :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Uh okay , that's it for me .
A :  Okay , thank you Peter . So um I have to inform you I receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . Um
B :  'Kay .
D :  Mm .
A :  first um , they say that's uh about something about t teletext . Uh apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date . Out-dated . And uh
A :  Because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and
A :  actually it's not useful to have teletext .
A :  Um .
A :  So I think we can avoid the teletext . Um the second thing is uh
A :  they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for T_V_ , not for D_V_D_ and other devices , because it make it it makes it's too complex and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on T_V_ on the only specific T_V_ remote control .
B :  I agree .
A :  The third the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . So um uh we should we should keep uh The the product should be recognisable . Uh , uh
A :  It's That mean we should use the colour of our company and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of in electronics .
A :  So , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from Real Reaction and he s they should recognise the company .
A :  So , um
A :  So now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . So , mm , are we going to use L_C_D_ , speech recognition ?
A :  Uh .
D :  Well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And then we can move on to the more advanced features .
C :  Mm . Yes .
A :  Maybe , maybe .
B :  Okay , so the available things are L_C_D_ , the buttons and everything . Uh radio frequency depends . And , well the recognition it depends on you guys . You should probably speak .
A :  Yeah but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? I mean
B :  Okay .
A :  what do
D :  Okay , well , I mean the obvious one is changing channels .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . So , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , okay .
A :  So , turning channel , of course . Volume setting .
B :  Uh just one note to the chan channel changing . Do we will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? I mean those nine plus one or two ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think it would be a b
B :  Because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . On the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's
D :  Yeah , I
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay so so we keep all these all these buttons .
C :  Yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button .
A :  Maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like
A :  uh
B :  Like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something .
A :  Yeah . Maybe something like that .
B :  Or using the names and the keyboard I dunno .
D :  Ah yeah .
A :  Uh .
C :  Or
C :  Or something .
A :  Maybe Oh I don't know .
A :  Oh .
A :  Maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  You mean like hierarchical structure .
A :  And inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch . If you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . I It just an idea . I don't know what you think about that but .
C :  Okay . Like categorising channels .
B :  Okay , so s Oh sorry .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
B :  So it requires the use of L_C_D_ probably , to to tell you
D :  To have some feedback . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , probably , yeah , yeah .
B :  Okay , so I'll make a note on L_C_D_ .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  We could maybe also c um incorporate Petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel . So we c you could quickly just through many channels . For the channels , perhaps .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . Like roller for the Yeah . Okay .
A :  Anything else ?
D :  So we've got channel and volume . Um .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So we are still s speaking about the common devices or we are inviting the new one ?
D :  I think so . I think basically the core functions we want , and then more advanced ones .
A :  Yeah .
A :  What about the settings of the T_V_ ? Because it's button we don't use very often , but
A :  it's we need it anyway . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  So uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the T_V_ design or we can change some design . Because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels and then you can Yeah . Yeah b Not on the control , on the screen , on the T_V_ screen . And then
B :  On the screen , you mean ? Not on the control , but on the screen .
B :  Well , this would avoid L_C_D_ , then .
D :  I don't
D :  Oh , I don't but I don't think we're we're the ones . I mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all T_V_s , I think .
A :  Yeah , yeah . I don't know if it's possible to to watch something on T_V_
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh .
B :  W I I think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the T_V_ to to to print these things . Well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the L_C_D_ and this stuff is no problem in the price .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So , what are we doing with the settings ? Because settings if we want to do settings we need buttons for that and we want less buttons , so . Maybe with the L_C_D_ we can do something with less buttons , but
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  But then you don't want to make the L_C_D_ display too complicated at the same time .
A :  Mm .
B :  Two T_V_s .
D :  I mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some
A :  Yeah . Oh yeah . Oh , the .
B :  Like ma
B :  We we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode . Or I dunno . Or like children and grandfather's mode , and the , well the the user
C : 
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  not the user , the man mana T_V_ manager mode . Ah , I dunno .
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So we have five minutes left . Um .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh .
D :  So I think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required . It's just how to a
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  We should hide them somewhere . In the menus of the L_C_D_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that .
B :  Hide them , okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Uh , okay , what else ?
B :  Um .
D :  I mean a power button's obviously
B :  Yes . This I was thinking . Do we need a power button at all ? Should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? Because generally
D :  uh required .
A :  It's it's a kind of setting , I think . It should fit in those settings functions . Because it's not a very current useful function .
C :  Mm .
C :  Settings .
D :  Uh , well I think when they say power button they mean to turn the T_V_ on and off .
B :  Yes .
A :  No , I think it's after after five minutes or something a timer I I think , no ?
B :  Well I I uh
D :  But if you're watching T_V_ for two hours , you don't want your T_V_ to turn off after five five minute
B :  You don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . Uh probably . Okay , so we should keep this button .
D :  I mean based on our usability studies again , um pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . Um , you know , it was nine out of ten
C :  Yeah .
A :  Oh okay , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay , so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the L_C_D_ and all the buttons and stuff , we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the T_V_ and if you close it , it will
D :  re relevance .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  turn off the T_V_ . If if you like this ,
D :  Okay .
D :  B Okay .
B :  Because , well it's maybe question for you t
D :  I think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , which is you sit down , you turn on your T_V_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the T_V_ off . Um and all the other f functionality is
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So s yeah .
C :  Yeah , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this . Like covering cu . Yeah , like mobile phone covering .
D :  not used very often .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  On the back , or
B :  Yeah . I mean like the
B :  Yeah but since we have the L_C_D_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons .
B :  Um , okay , just um the decision of the power button . Should we make it a button , or some some something which would be
A :  For what ?
B :  Uh power button .
D :  I think a button .
C :  A button is better .
D :  I think it should be a bu
A :  Ah oh yeah , yeah . Yeah a button , yeah I guess so .
B :  If it if it's a button or Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Its own button on the front .
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay , one nice big button . Old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
A :  So , any other suggestions or functions ?
D :  What about things like the clock and um timers ?
B :  Do we still have the time ? I I just wonder .
A :  Yeah , we have still one or two minutes to talk , yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Oh . Well what w what was the question ?
C :  Clock or
D :  Uh um , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display
A :  Usually it's already on T_V_ or something like that .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah but since we want to control all the televisions ,
B :  and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , no ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Because if if the T_V_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time The timer should be there .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . If we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , and is it very useful ? I mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ?
C :  Mm .
D :  Probably not . It's a questi yeah , it's a trade-off .
A :  This is the question . Is it useful ?
C :  Yes .
A :  W In my opinion we should have only useful thing and Because apparently they want The simpler it's is better .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Ah , yeah .
D :  Okay simple .
B :  Did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the T_V_ , well And based on your
D :  Very , yeah okay , very occasionally . But I do use the I do use the display of the time quite often , but
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah that's okay , that's true . Okay , so no time button . Okay .
A :  No time on .
C :  And uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ?
B :  Yes yes .
A :  I think
C :  I I thin I think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , so people may be attracted to buy this stuff and it's not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone . It doesn't take that much place and also that much It doesn't cost that much .
B :  Yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life , then . If we use the speech recognition .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So maybe we think we can think more about that , and discuss that maybe last time next time . And uh yeah , now the meeting room is busy . Somebody booked the meeting room just for at one P_M_ , and so we should leave .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh .
A :  So , um . So now we are going for for a small lunch . It's uh funded by the company . And uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works . And uh I will do the minutes . And uh
A :  you are going to work on your individual works . And uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on . Thank you everybody .
D :  Okay , cool . Okay
C :  Thanks .
D :  Thank you .
D :  So
A :  I hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting .
D :  Of course .
A :  Um so I will take the minutes you mm you three are going to do presentation .
A :  Um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement so we need uh to know the the user uh needs that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part we want to know how it going to work and um
A :  third part uh I don't remember which is not very good .
A :  Ah of course , how to to design this uh this yeah .
D :  Nice stuff
A :  um let's go for the three presentations , so first um Marketing Expert .
D :  Who starts ?
D :  Oh . Ha . okay . So I dunno if I can do that like this ? Yeah ?
A :  So wait a minute . Mm .
D :  So it's being modified . Do you want yeah , open . Read only . I hope I saved it . So , um yeah , this is my name .
B :  Sammy Benjo . I know this name uh . We met before .
A :  Sounds uh
D :  So as you know , you I think you already know me , Sammy Benjo . I am the expert in marketing and I want to tell you about what people uh s want and uh like and dislike in remote controls , and I hope this is going to help you to to design it correctly . So next please .
D :  Uh-oh .
A :  Mm uh .
C :  Yeah , it is put F_ five .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Hmm .
C :  The full page presentation , yep .
D :  Yeah maybe in the full page because i I spent lots of time doing this presentation , so .
B :  F_ F_ five .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . Yep .
A :  F_ five .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Uh-huh hmm okay .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm .
D :  So basically uh what I suggest is that uh instead of deciding ourself what what could be and what should be a good uh remote control , let's ask people who are users of remote controls how they feel about w the current remote controls , what they like , what they don't like and um and what they do with them by the way because they are supposed to be useful .
D :  Don't forget about that . So we've we've conducted a a survey on on the use of uh remote controls and I'd like to show you some of the results we found on this survey .
D :  And next please .
D :  Yeah , so basically what we found was that uh there are several things that the user don't like in remote controls .
D :  First of all , they find it very ugly . Current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , I mean they're all the same , and they're not l good looking .
D :  Um what is interesting is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control , so I think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um .
D :  And the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls .
D :  For instance uh we see that uh they zap very often so I think this is a very uh important uh functionality that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another .
D :  And most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , so I think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using .
D :  Um next please . Now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls and they for instance uh they don't even find it it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home and nobody knows where it is .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please , where are you ? Like uh something to to like t I think phones . Some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . Uh of course phone you can always phone your phone but you can't phone your your remote control . But why not ? Yeah .
B :  Agree .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  You can you are .
A :  Why not ?
D :  And because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls that nobody use , in fact they don't even know how to use them , so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls .
C :  Hmm .
D :  And uh they are bad for R_S_I_ but uh I don't remember what is R_S_I_ . So I think they are bad . Mm-hmm . Mm nobody has any idea about that ? Well I'll check uh with my
A :  Okay uh tha that's look great .
B :  R_S_I_ mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect .
D :  Oh , okay , I think it's a technical thing which our
B :  No , I don't think so .
C :  Yeah , because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , and those waves have high
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay . But twenty six percent , do you know
D :  So , it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know but we have to take this into account .
A :  Or something we don't know . Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh .
B :  Twenty five .
C :  Uh .
B :  Every fourth , you know . Every four some of us knows .
C :  Yeah it's
C :  People really
D :  So anyway that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user and um
A :  Okay .
B :  One of us
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  what else do I have ? Next slide ?
D :  Ah yeah . So we've listed a couple of uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Functions .
D :  s uh functions that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls and uh well the tables look very nice to read but what is important is to understand that the power button is not used often because in general you use it only once per session , but it is very relevant .
D :  People want to have a power button . Channel selection is uh o often used very often used and indeed uh very relevant .
D :  Ah now I remember what is R_S_I_ it's repetitivity stress injury .
D :  We have to be careful with that word but uh anyway I continue my presentation so yeah , channel selection is um very important , very often used .
C :  Uh .
D :  Volume is not often used but people uh want to have control on volume and that makes sense of course . And n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . Audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings .
D :  All of them . they're not often used and they are s more or less relevant . It seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , even if I personally never use it but seems that it's average relevant at least , so .
A :  I have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , that it's out of date now because of internet .
D :  I can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , which is not as uh these these two one were had I think ten I think .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But but if you compare with these ones , uh I think they scored a one or two . Not very relevant , so
C :  Hmm .
D :  if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay but just know that people find it somehow relevant .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  That's for the main functions I think and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . For instance I think net next slide .
D :  One of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want .
D :  So we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control and as we can see it really depends on the age . Young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant .
D :  And uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down . So now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? I think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider .
C :  Yeah .
C :  'Cause
D :  If we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be so now this is of course , depends on that .
A :  Mm-mm . Okay .
D :  And um I don't have any conclusion , I didn't have time the meeting was very tight , so that's basically my findings . And uh , if you have any question ?
A :  Mm I think it's good , okay . You done a good review .
B :  I got one question , uh you are a Market Expert so should we aim at the young people or not ?
D :  I can go back . Yeah one question , yeah ?
C :  Thank you .
D :  I am .
D :  I think we should aim at the young people . But uh I think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device . In general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , less than more than
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay , then teletext is used less .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Then teletext is useless for them I think , yeah . Because they they have other means of finding their information . Yeah . But yeah . Nope .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm mm mm . Okay . That's good point .
C :  Mm , yep .
B :  Mm . Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  'Kay ?
C :  Thank you .
A :  So um now I think it's the turn of the
A :  the I'm not sure um
A :  Of the technical function , so
A :  uh
D :  So I think it's you , huh ?
C :  Uh it's
D :  No ?
B :  That's me .
C :  techni function of
A :  what effect
D :  No , user requiremen
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Wait a second . Argh .
C :  I have to do working design so uh .
B :  That's but this but number three , yes .
A :  So you're
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So , my name is Mark Dwight , and um I am responsible for User Interface Design . However , uh mm Project Manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design .
B :  Uh , as I'm a more an artist that's gonna be less technical functions but more User Interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . So next slide please .
A :  Okay . Let's go .
B :  And uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task is not to forget about uh Occam razor . We should never complicate things too much . We should only make a remote control , nothing more . Nothing more than this , just a remote control .
C :  Mm .
B :  'Cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use .
D :  Makes sense .
B :  So , make a click , please .
B :  So here is this remote control .
B :  It's quite a standard one , but it's not from a T_V_ , it's from a much
B :  easier device like air conditioning or something . But you know , we can use it for a T_V_ easily .
B :  Only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , and please make a click , compared to this one
C :  It's
B :  which one would you prefer ? I guess this .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  I would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh I find the buttons that I need every time I need a button .
B :  Sure , sure .
C :  Yeah . Maybe it can be yeah middle of like , between those two li
B :  Yeah , and our method is going to be , provide simple
A :  Oh sorry .
B :  simple desires into simple actions .
D :  Nice . Nice sentence .
B :  Findings .
A :  Okay . Oh sorry .
B :  Our question of the style , we should remember that our company
B :  puts fashion into electronics
B :  and we should never forget about it .
B :  Concept . Be simple . Be simple and you'll lean on this market . Market is a of remote controls you know it better , it's very
C :  S you should yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  well , it's
B :  it's not an easy field to to play , you know ?
B :  So be simple . For personal preferences I think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium .
B :  It's a really good style , it going to be look like like this .
B :  It is unbreakable and it is very universal .
B :  W we'll have a screen with a back light which can change colours ,
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  and we can put all the options into this screen . We'll need only few buttons . All the other things can be controlled through the screen .
B :  And all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , but you should do it by touching it and finding it easily just by touch . So
B :  Press
B :  I would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium
C :  Mm .
B :  I think , and uh what else ? I got just very few and good ideas . We need power and volume .
B :  And let us include two nice features into this device , first , power on and off can be made fully automatic .
B :  When you go to the sofa , take your control and point it to the T_V_ ,
D :  Hmm .
A :  It's off . It's on .
B :  the T_V_ turns on .
D :  And when does it turn off ?
B :  When you don't touch the control but you go out of the
D :  Oh so you have a
B :  For for enough time like uh you
D :  sensing sensor machine that uh knows
B :  It's a question to our technical design , our two engineers . And another nice feature that I would like to implement is uh volume control . Suppose you set u you set up some volume and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room and take your control with you .
C : 
D :  Tech
B :  Like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes .
A :  Or you want to go to the kitchen .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It's easy to do , you just control the
D :  According to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system .
C :  Distance .
B :  According to the distance . Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Uh I'm not sure about the screen , wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? Uh is it a touch screen by the way ?
B :  So
B :  I think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter .
D :  So it gives instructions but uh it has to be with an back light somehow .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So , its main purpose in fact is a back light , which change colours , which makes it easier to find ,
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
B :  and each can it can respond for your voice , like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , yeah ?
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
B :  So basically that's it .
A :  Um I see that you target uh several s application not only T_V_ but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control .
B :  Can be easily done , 'cause
A :  Yeah .
B :  you got simple designs , y we should put it to simple actions . Let it be universal , so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . You want to change tracks and you want to adjust volume .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Just few actions , a few actions for everything . All the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen .
C :  Mm .
A :  Hmm . S
A :  Mm .
A :  Since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control I think we will only concentrate on T_V_ for the moment and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah .
C :  Mm . Yeah and it mm .
B :  Okay , okay .
B :  Okay , but it's quite universal you know .
C :  Mm .
B :  We can just extend it to any device .
C :  Mm .
D :  So for instance if I want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would I do can I do that with this ?
B :  Uh twenty five .
D :  Yeah mm let's say I am uh on channel eight now . You know these days we have hundreds of channels , that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . Or is it ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  In fact I would propose another solution . Basically you use just four or five channels , right ? Yeah . So uh set up your T_V_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel .
D :  Most people yeah .
D :  In fact in in one uh remote control that I've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that I want to by cycled with my next button . I uh
A :  Yeah it's it's the same solution , I think . Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  B yeah .
C :  But even we can have some uh L_C_D_ display , like you can uh de you can just button the number and then it go t because
D :  Go to channel twenty five . One thing is that as I said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . So even if they are only watching four or five channels , I think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But still
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah uh on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And it's only next . Yeah so but you have to
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . We got these buttons here . Next next . Or say this can be back .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah. .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But otherwise like we can put some display on numbers and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five and then
D :  So it would be
D :  Okay .
A :  Maybe we can make uh different modes for each button and you can change mode zapping mode or
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm . Alright . Listening more .
A :  uh current chan
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah but since we are focusing only on T_V_ remote controls so we can have more functions for T_V_ uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Could we carry out some research if we w really need this , like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ?
D :  Well I could could uh have a look at that maybe . I'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Although I don't know .
B :  Alright ? Thanks for your attention .
A :  Uh you're finish ? Okay . So now the technical aspects of this new device .
A :  Mm .
C :  Two .
C :  Yeah , if
C :  Sorry . Yeah . Uh as you know , I am mister Ramaro . I am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices and I previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators . So now I'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control .
A :  You prefer it .
C :  Well , as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like T_V_ or V_C_R_ or D_V_D_ player etcetera .
C :  So we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like T_V_ .
C :  So we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device .
C :  And usually this so to do these functions we need an interface , which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that .
C :  And then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message and then it will process by the chip and then it will generate some information to the main device .
C :  It's generally in the form of infrared or
C :  some kind of s sensor information . Then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want .
C :  So , basically we need uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control we need few components , mainly the energy source like the battery and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want ,
C :  and then we have some chip , it's mainly digital signal processing chip because since we are I am one doing mostly digital uh devices we ought to have some kind of processor which take care of all these functions and put it in some digital format .
C :  And then we'll have the infrared L_E_D_ source which sends the information to the main device .
C :  Then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , and we ought to do different codes for different T_V_s , so some T_V_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  To make it quite uh an universal uh device uh .
C :  Yeah yeah , because the people don't use one particular brand so or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
C :  So we need to check their specifications and do their uh encryption that's passing information to the T_V_ device . So we need to have particular encryption codes .
A :  Okay .
C :  Then , components , so we have the main uh energy source and then we will have some buttons and then we will have infrared uh source and then we have some inside some chip in in the device .
C :  Uh since I don't have much time so I'll input the connections to all this components . And since I also want to know feedback from our Marketing Expert and User Interface , so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . And from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I'm sure , because since our User Interface speech recognition and also Marketing Expert for the speech recognition is really handy , so we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our D_S_B_ chip . Since we have some kind of uh energy this is our
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  this normal battery , so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user so you just yeah , so that we just use simple recog no but but
A :  On
A :  Uh train it , okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Too complex .
D :  But uh very very good to sell .
C :  Yeah . No , even in you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah .
D :  Think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , and ha ha you cannot use my remote control , because it's targeted to me . Whatever .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . And what about the price of this component ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  So
C :  Uh maybe we can make uh it in five Euros and even less than that , because we want to have uh millions and in bulk , so we can make really simp and we want to make really simple device because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like then we'll have something like this um
A :  It mm okay .
D :  Hmm . Cheap .
D :  Millions .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  Cheap .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  we'll have volume
C :  and then we will have s particular channel , so users can listen .
D :  The user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume or or it will be something like volume , up , down .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  No , yeah , a user can use any kind of sender but they should have this prompt volume and then yeah volume and decrease or increase , so we try to only recognise those words and and because we can't really say user to say same wording then it become more mechanical and yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  With a keywords and yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Couple of words .
A :  Mm-hmm mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Um .
C :  And then we can have channel they can say , okay I want eight , because we don't know like users have different programmes , I mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh so we just want channel number , we don't want like B_B_C_ or C_N_N_ or something else because
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Of course uh it has to be
C :  it will be complicated so we'll have only these three uh main basic uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , it's it it will be take care of our main mm .
D :  Okay .
B :  No you know it's a conceptual question , 'cause now I see th this the picture in front of my eyes like a user taking his remote control and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , and and he's coming you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down .
D :  But then I think you
D :  you
D :  First of all I I think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . It's on top of using the button .
A :  No , in no not only speech , yeah .
B :  Okay , for this budget like twelve Euros .
A :  I it's an option .
D :  Well , I dunno .
C :  Yeah actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this processor and
C :  This really , suppose like here we have our main chip which controls power , volume and this part and this D_S_P_s .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use D_S_P_ then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key .
C :  So it may not be like very expensive , because since we are only focusing on T_V_ remote control so and we have only few things here
B :  Okay. .
D :  T_V_ .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
A :  Sho to to train , okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Did you consider the r gest uh gesture recognition ? Like , if I want to put volume up I like do mm I take my remote control do like something like
C :  Um uh uh this point we didn't consider because it's it's very expensive because v our target is only like twelve point five Euros and
B :  roll 'em up or roll 'em down .
A :  Mm .
D :  Very expensive , no ?
A :  And well , what about the idea of automatic on off on the button , yeah .
B :  Mm why ? That's just
C :  Yeah , even automatic on off is also a bit problematic , because it different criteria for different people like so suppose people are really uh they just uh they don't touch the remote and mm y you don't know how much time you need to switch on or switch off and
D :  And volume control .
D :  So but uh
D :  Sh should we target a a user personalised uh uh remote control ? So in in a given room there might be more than one remote control . We would uh have each one and uh with our own personal uh settings .
C :  Yay yeah .
C :  Yeah that can be possible , especially for power settings , so user can say okay , suppose they're watching a tennis match or something then they can say okay uh after one hour I
D :  Hmm .
A :  Wouldn't that make uh arguments ? I want uh
C :  They can make
D :  Yeah , of course . That's no problem , we will sell more . Yeah exactly .
C :  Yeah we can have
A :  And we can increase this the strength y you can buy one with
B :  We got a really good Market Expert . Let's send more , let's sell more .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . You have mm something else to say ? Uh .
C :  Uh , not very much , like yeah .
A :  No .
D :  Okay . Thanks .
A :  Okay , thanks .
C :  Thank you . Yep .
C :  Thank you .
A :  So
C :  Can you just yeah .
A :  mm I think , okay , we're just on time .
A :  Um mm mm .
A :  So , we're now going to l have the lunch break .
D :  Mm great .
A :  Then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , and um
A :  we will uh meet again for the next meeting , and uh in this one want to
A :  to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components so
A :  uh
A :  you will focus on the component concept um
C :  Yeah yeah .
A :  uh of course the U_I_D_ Mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept and uh our m Market Expert Sammy Benjo uh on the trend watching .
C :  Mark will
A :  So um of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach .
A :  Well I think that's all .
A :  And we have um maybe we have to we say , only for T_V_ , not teletext ? Uh I think automatic on off control uh it's not possible .
C :  Uh it's in current price , yeah .
D :  Difficult .
A :  Yeah , maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But speech recogniser can be possible .
A :  Yeah , implemented . O okay , we can think about that .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And um
A :  do you see something else ?
D :  No .
B :  Uh , should it be equipped with the
B :  uh , with uh speakers ?
D :  Speakers in the remote cont
B :  Like , you want to find it , you shout
D :  Oh yeah .
A :  Uh yeah that's
B :  control , and it answers is I'm here ? Or
D :  It just beeps . That would be enough . Something very cheap .
B :  Just beeps ?
A :  Or maybe you want to phone him .
D :  But that's ex that's expensive . Uh .
C :  Yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Since now all yeah ?
C :  Yeah , especially the power , it really consumes because it should be all the time on and
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Well I I heard of devices where you just uh whistle them and and they because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . You can't whistle . Uh-huh . Or a clap .
A :  And uh
A :  And it's answered .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I can't whistle . No , no , I can't .
B :  Mm .
D :  You can clap . Can you ? Clap is good . Tak
A :  Clap clap clap it's a good I I think it's universal .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Just a suggestion . With only one hand ? These are not our target people .
B :  Okay .
A :  What about people without hand ? Yeah .
C :  Yeah I think it's good .
A :  Mm uh okay .
C :  But it's a good feature I guess yeah we need to think about more how to incorporate it .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  Just don't interfere with other devices like 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh that's e that already exists okay okay . Oh yeah , you do have . Wow . You're trendy .
C :  Oh .
B :  Yeah , I got it at my home , like . Oops .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Ah it's
A :  Mm-hmm , so let's to think s so that yeah . I think that could be in the component uh concept uh .
D :  Think about it . Yeah , okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  It yes .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Good we're done ? Right , thanks .
A :  So , yeah , let's go to lunch .
C :  Yeah . Thank you , thank you very much .
A :  So we come again for the the second meeting .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh for the aim of this
A :  now is to
A :  to make presentation about
A :  uh the work for each one .
A :  And take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote
B :  Okay .
A :  control . And we have think I got a new project requirement . So I think
C :  Okay .
A :  uh teletext becomes outdated .
A :  So the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , and I think we don't need lighting adaptive , so the remote control should be only used for the the television .
C :  Okay .
A :  And of course we should have our image
A :  in the in the design .
A :  So , let's start with the
A :  the industrial designer .
C :  Yeah , alright . So uh
A :  .
A :  Or y you can use the whiteboard if you want .
C :  Well I have a PowerPoint pr presentation stored in my
A :  Here .
C :  in my personal folder so I I I think you can reach it from here .
D :  Just go to explorer .
A :  Oh okay .
D :  Or open .
D :  Participant two .
C :  Participant two .
A :  This one .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Open uh .
C :  Uh open .
A :  Do you want to open
B :  Because it's open you mean .
C :  Right , so um I will talk about the the w working design and
B :  F_ five .
D :  Slide show , view slide show , .
A :  Ah .
C :  And um well I I will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . So uh can you go one page down , please . So I think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . So uh mm I'm thin uh I think uh I I'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use .
C :  Then uh I will try with the technical team to to build a prototype and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like . And how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . And when we are ready with this first prototype I I think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . Okay so can you go down uh
C :  So , wha what I think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired so uh I think we u we can use a battery for the . Then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . And the communication with the T_V_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication
C :  So uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the T_V_ set .
B :  Did you draw it ?
A :  Wow .
B :  This . What is the other chip for ? The one on top .
A :  This
C :  The one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the T_V_ set .
D :  One is a communication .
B :  For men .
B :  To the in
B :  Okay .
C :  And , that's it . I think we should use a F_P_G_A_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t
B :  Mm .
B :  What is F_P_G_A_ ?
C :  It's field programmable uh something array . Yeah .
D :  Gateway arrays . It's a field programmable gateway arrays .
B :  So why's it how is it different from the Bluetooth ?
C :  Well , uh a F_P_G_A_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . And uh well the Bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices .
B :  Yeah . Programme it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh
B :  So this are the they have to work together ? Or ? Do they have to work together or two separate choice
C :  No . Well , th the F_P_G_A_ will produce the the data to send .
B :  Okay .
D :  Or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? And the second one is for the software . Yeah to run th to make it run . That's it .
B :  Is the is the software par alri okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , okay . So you can control if you want , right ?
C :  Yeah . Alright and that's it for the working design . So if you have any questions ?
D :  No .
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay , and how about the battery power ? Uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ?
C :  Uh no no no no , I think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the yeah into the t . Yeah , yeah . And uh I I don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run , so
A :  .
D :  Into the more compact and uh okay , .
B :  Mm . Mm .
D :  Yeah , yeah . Okay .
B :  Mm . You can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it .
C :  Yeah .
C :  It's a good idea .
D :  Yeah , that's right . Having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . People don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . We just make a small charger and put it
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh mm . Y yeah , yeah . Because you are using because you are using Bluetooth , if some people have P_D_A_ they can use their P_D_A_ to control the T_V_ if they want to , right ?
C :  That's a good idea .
A :  You can i yeah .
C :  Also , but but I I I think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control . S okay , so charger for is the .
D :  Bu
B :  I dunno .
A :  Yeah we can change the b .
D :  Our remote , we do not want to make it P_D_A_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
B :  So is mine .
A :  It's mine . Participant one , no ?
B :  Oh .
B :  Yeah , this your
A :  Mm .
A :  Oh we have so let's move to
A :  to user interface design .
B :  Yeah . So you can open uh three .
A :  Participant
B :  Yeah .
B :  So
B :  So I'm working on the technical functions design .
B :  can you show the next slide .
B :  So the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . So so I found on a webs on the internet yeah . I spent a lot of time searching and uh and I found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . For example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . So I found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors so can you
A :  During the weekend .
A :  That's good .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  This are usual functionality .
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Ours is a bit uh different . So these are two example . One is from the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . This is the most competing prototypes I've found . But then uh loo but then I found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons
A :  Tasks .
A :  And they are small .
B :  Yeah . O on the right I tried to play with the problem is that uh if I have hundred channels I have uh I have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and I have to compose the number so it's very lousy . So you so you move to the next the next one .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Of course .
B :  Yeah , so I talk about the problem . And then I I look at the user manual they are a hundred pages thick , so we don't want that . So I propose the easy to use uh prototype . You can navigate on T_V_ screen and we can the user's preference and we need to have the T_V_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the T_V_ programmes by X_M_L_ and we need some to do some preprocessing . From the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the T_V_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? And then we the speech recognition as uh Harry says we may just put in we may K_I_V_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  What do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the T_V_
B :  Yeah , all the processing is done the T_V_ is a compu has some processing power the
A :  than the
C :  So we have to t
A :  So we should have specific T_V_ ? Or ? We can use this .
B :  Yeah .
C :  We have to sell a T_V_ with the remote control too .
A :  Yeah , we don't
B :  Yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay .
A :  Yeah , I think so . J j just the remote control .
D :  Yeah , not the T_V_s .
C :  I think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the T_V_ set on recorders or thing like that and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . So i the processing on on the remote controller so it can u be used in any T_V_ , any conventional T_V_ sets ?
D :  Yeah , that's right .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , we .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Okay .
A :  Speech recognition .
B :  N yeah , that's all . The next one ? So I come up with a simple design , just keep the v navigation buttons .
C :  Yes , that's a good idea , I think . We d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the T_V_ so uh
A :  Keep the navigation but
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient . It's easy to build ,
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  it does not consume much power .
D :  Yeah , that's right .
A :  .
B :  Okay , that's all .
D :  Oh , but you have a catch there , um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then .
C :  Well , then y you you go to the main menu and uh you have uh go to channel and then uh you can
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm . No , because you choose by channel , so you choose by T_V_ program so you don't have hundred channels to choose from .
C :  Yeah . Maybe you
D :  Uh-huh huh huh huh .
D :  Mm-hmm hmm hmm .
C :  .
B :  If you go by channel , you don't have to do that .
C :  but uh I I think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could
D :  But
A :  So you are
B :  Ah .
D :  Yeah then yeah that's right .
B :  Ah , a big jump .
B :  A mouse or
C :  Well , not a mouse but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm hmm hmm . Okay .
A :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
C :  So , we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But we'll see .
A :  How the this remote ?
B :  Uh it's gonna be small . Yeah . So it'll beep if you wanna find it you just uh shout y h just it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . I dunno how bu
A :  Yeah , of course small .
D :  too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it .
D :  Yeah , that's .
D :  just give it a name and we call him . Yeah , that's right . Yeah , that's right .
B :  And responds to you , and
C :  Okay , so uh next presentation
A :  Participant four .
A :  So Harry .
D :  Okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , I think most of the points which I want to are already covered here . And to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , and the users send the feedbacks , and based on that
C :  Mm .
D :  These are the findings which we got and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a T_V_ remote but the technology
D :  We already know that as discussed earlier
C :  Well I I think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts
D :  An it does how feasible it is .
B :  I- mm . But I think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . I if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary
D :  Oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . We just have the
C :  Yeah .
C :  And this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  so it's a good idea .
D :  it's not going to take much space also . It's going to be very slim . And next one was the size of the remote control . It has to be of course a very slim and small one .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
D :  And of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , so this is an important criteria here is
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But
A :  But do you think what they sug suggested s possibility .
D :  I mean we have to look for a trade-off . The features and the cost .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I no I I think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . Maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay
A :  Yeah .
D :  Little bit more if it's with extra features .
C :  Yeah .
A :  It
B :  little bit more for comfort , yeah , extra features .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature I think
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , yeah . That's right .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
A :  But is it useful or not u
C :  Well , uh
A :  I don't know . There is in the
D :  I mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . Or they say movie name or I don't go for movie names but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
D :  So , I think this should be a good idea , to put this features . And the fourth one was the teletext in various languages .
C :  Well , we are we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so
D :  Mm , I think
C :  I well it will be alright .
A :  I think i
B :  What is the teletext ?
A :  If it's necessary can you can do that . We can integrate small microphone in the remote so it's not really a problem .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  What about lighting adaptive options ? According to the re to the new requirements I think we don't need that .
D :  Yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but I think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required .
A :  Yeah .
B :  It is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller .
A :  Mm .
B :  So you need s special T_V_ sets to do that ? Or it's it's done via this remote controller ?
B :  It's very complex .
D :  I mean
C :  Yeah , I think it's a bit complex too
D :  I mean yeah , it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not .
B :  Mm .
C :  For our next product , our new T_V_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light
D :  I think
B :  Yeah , then we can conclude that .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but it's quite possible but maybe not in this project .
A :  So we have I think we have s still we have
A :  couple of minutes . Mm-mm .
A :  So any things to
A :  to discuss ?
A :  Or any suggestions ?
D :  I think as I discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing .
D :  The speech interface and uh less uh reasonable uh cost .
A :  Expensive .
A :  Price .
B :  Mm .
D :  And the lighting adaptation and the teletext . And regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . If you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes . And uh if you are a French guy watching an English movie you would like to have it in French . And if I am a German then I would like to have the my options in German . So , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . That should be a good uh point .
B :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . Okay .
B :  Mm .
C :  .
C :  Function .
C :  Yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? I I I think we should give up with teletext , no ?
A :  I think we we can we
A :  is the .
C :  Yes .
C :  Well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television .
B :  Mm .
C :  Because if
B :  Using the T_V_ to access the internet ? Or what ? I didn't quite understand
C :  Yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be T_V_ set that can access the internet .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
C :  So it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . So if we already have it in our remote control
D :  We already have some .
A :  So you have to anticipate the the future ?
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . The future demand , market demand .
C :  Yeah , to desi well , not not to implement it , but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible .
D :  Yeah , that's right .
B :  The functionality in the future . Alright .
A :  .
A :  In future .
B :  Yeah . Because all the T_V_ sets will be digital , right . All the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . Th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah , .
C :  Okay . So
A :  Okay .
A :  So let's go for the the lunch break , and
C :  Okay , thank you .
B :  Okay . Thank you .
A :  we will meet after .
D :  Okay , thank you .
A :  Okay uh Agnes , you can help me for the slide when okay .
C :  Yep . Sure .
A :  Okay , welcome back .
A :  I hope uh you have a fresh head and a fresh time .
A :  How t now the meeting actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting .
A :  Okay , and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you .
A :  And it's in the , I think uh , in the sharing folder .
A :  And uh I will invite uh the Christine and the Ed and uh Agnes to discuss about on the various subjects .
A :  So can you go to the next slide ?
A :  Yeah uh the agenda of the meeting is opening .
A :  Then uh I'm going to talk about uh the project management , what I'm going to do , and uh , of course , I'm doing the project management and secretary both ,
A :  okay , to take the minutes of the meeting .
A :  And there are three presentations .
A :  One is uh new project requirements .
A :  And the second one about uh decision on remote control functions .
A :  And uh finally we are closing .
A :  Uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes , so you have to be very quick .
A :  And I have come up with the management come with the new proposal , okay , and I have to discuss a few points on this .
A :  Uh both says new insights in the aim of your project .
A :  Uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded , okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology .
A :  So we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design .
A :  And the second one is about uh the remote control .
A :  Should be used only for the T_V_ .
A :  That's what our uh management says .
A :  And the third point , it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image , okay , with this new project or new product .
A :  Okay .
A :  So I will invite uh
A :  Agnes , can you go to the third slide ?
C :  No , this is the third slide .
A :  Okay , .
A :  So , I'll invite uh Christine to discuss about uh the functional design .
B :  'Kay , do you wanna open the
C :  Sure .
C :  Um .
C :  You're participant s
B :  I'm number two .
C :  Two ?
B :  That's it .
C :  Do you want the mouse , or do you want me to
B :  I'll do the notes . Yeah , thanks .
B :  So um well I I figured uh we should um identify some user requirements , and from my experience , I wanna uh , and from research I did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , you can't uh can't have like uh waffling on this point , you know . Really have
B :  It needs to be able y y have to be able to find it .
B :  Because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them .
B :  So uh , I also , since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , thought we better look at things that are popular and um ex go beyond those , and , as I said in the first meeting ,
B :  um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product so that it gives the appearance , and it is reliable , and so forth .
B :  I did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls and when they were invented and so forth , so , I guess this guy Zenith uh created the Flashmatic , which I kinda like the idea , 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the T_V_ on and off , that might be interesting .
B :  And um so it was highly directional flash light that uh you could turn the picture on and off , and the sound on and off , and change channels c so I think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And uh it was really a pioneering innovation , but it was uh sensitive to the sun , so that uh it would get would start off by the you'd get it would easily cause um problems .
B :  So , uh
B :  I in addition to uh looking at the um uh the functional requir so all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today
B :  which I think the one in the middle
B :  is r um really uh something to keep in mind . It'd be easy to find .
D :  Fantastic .
B :  And um it would uh y you'd you could throw it at things if if the T_V_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else .
B :  And since I'm not really um Industrial Designer , I didn't really know what to do with this slide .
B :  But um
B :  I just took some different uh schematics and I put them into this , and I guess this is what a slide might look like if you were drawing a circuit board . I don't know why um we were asked to do this .
B :  So ,
B :  uh personal preferences , um
B :  I think we could uh I I'm really thinking outside the box here , and I think that we should consider perhaps having an an an a a size uh a remote control that changes in size depending on the user preference .
B :  So something that's very very flexible and inflatable and then you could shrink it .
B :  I think um it could either be you could go either one extreme , be very colourful , or you could make it clear , and um kind of blend in with things , so you didn't have to um uh have a problem with the th the decoration of the of the user's home .
B :  Um I think uh it needs to be waterproof , because uh sometimes they fall into cups and , you know , it might be out by the swimming pool or something like that .
B :  Um if you uh mi one of one of my requirements was about needs t to tell you when it's done its job or not , because half the time , I keep pushing on the remote control , and I don't know if it's actually understood my message , so I think it should give you some sort of an oral cue .
B :  And uh , course I never wanna replace the battery .
B :  So , that's those are my f preferences , and that's my presentation .
A :  Yeah , let me uh interrupt you uh
A :  if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable .
B :  Yes .
A :  Okay , because uh especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids , okay , and the kids throw it and they they play with their remotes and .
B :  Run over it with a car .
A :  Yes .
A :  Okay , so if you can add the feature , okay , for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design
A :  okay , with unbreakable , okay , I think that will give a lot of advantage for our product ,
B :  Good idea . Good idea , I'll I'll uh um
A :  if I'm not wrong .
A :  Maybe you can uh add it in that .
B :  Yes , very good .
A :  Okay , uh thank you Christine , and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ?
C :  Do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ?
C :  'Cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder , whereas having something like , I dunno , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Titanium . Titanium would be be heavy , too , wouldn't it ?
D :  Titanium .
C :  Yeah .
B :  No , I haven't really um I wanted feedback , I think we need to rate rank these , but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Sure , yeah . No , I just wondering whether that you had any sort of
B :  I like titanium . It's light .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Expensive .
B :  Uh yeah but uh who who said who said we were , you know , nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so um
C :  The marketing comes out .
A :  Yes .
A :  Yeah so
B :  It'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though .
A :  Yeah the the I'm sorry because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing .
A :  Uh let me go quickly , maybe if I can go back .
A :  I know the project plan and the budget .
A :  So I can close this , not sure .
A :  Was in uh
A :  This .
A :  So let me see where is this file .
C :  That's Christine's .
A :  This is Christine .
C :  And that's mine , I think .
A :  That's yours , okay .
A :  Saving .
D : 
C :  In modified .
D :  I don't know , I think verbally we can we can pretty much sell .
A :  Okay , uh I will I will send you a mail , okay ? The project may be the the project aim , okay .
A :  At the end of the day , the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million Euro .
A :  Okay , and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side .
A :  Okay , that maybe Eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price and uh what's uh how much its cost for the manufacturing and how much it's going to be we sell in the market .
A :  Okay .
A :  Then uh you can come back with your feedback .
A :  And I I have one maybe the suggestion or opinion . This remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any T_V_ .
A :  Okay , and it will be slim , okay , and uh
B :  Not fat ?
A :  Not fat .
B :  Not fat , huh .
A :  Okay .
B :  Might be hard to find , though .
A :  Yep .
D :  Hmm .
A :  But let's try it , okay , with the different uh the designs , okay , the functional designs .
B :  Oh , okay .
A :  Okay ?
A :  So any other questions ?
D :  Uh from her side , I don't think uh there's too many more questions . If you can come to the
A :  Okay . Thank you Christine for uh time being , so then uh
A :  Ed , so can you tell about
D :  Okay , from the marketing yeah , from the marketing side , just to to give an idea what the management is looking for , I was looking for a a remote control to have a s
C :  S 'scuse me for one sec .
D :  I have a sales price of twenty-five Euro , with a production price of uh twelve and a half Euro .
D :  For what uh I think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , I don't think that price is exactly in the market .
D :  Okay ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I'll explain myself here now in the sense that uh
D :  in a in the recent surveys , uh from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy .
D :  Twenty-five Euros , uh that's that's a preson reasonable price . That's a market price right now .
D :  Now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , but give them added things that they don't have now , then it w it could possibly sell . Obviously the risk is there .
A :  Yep .
A :  Yep .
D :  Too expensive , they're not gonna buy .
D :  But , I think uh there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested .
D :  And we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote .
B :  Speech recognition? .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Obviously , we can't make a remote into a computer , but maybe simple commands .
D :  I dunno , louder , softer , on , off .
D :  That might be a possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this .
D :  Thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use .
D :  So we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly .
D :  Uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time .
D :  So maybe one word speech recognition commands , say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home .
D :  But , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible .
D :  But if it's trendy , if it's fancy , it's got some colour to it , if it's very easy easy to use , if it's got simple remote speech remote uh control , like I said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , I can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset 'cause I can't turn the T_V_ on .
D :  So we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial uh design .
D :  But , price obviously we have to talk about .
A :  Yep .
A :  So what do you think about uh the design ? Do you think you can make it or uh
B :  D uh I'm sorry ?
A :  What do you think about uh the design , uh what he was talking about of the speech recognition ?
D :  Speech recognition .
B :  Well , uh training is always an issue with uh commands .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So um might uh we can perhaps um do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost .
B :  Not sure how .
B :  But um anyway , um I I think also that uh this might impact the battery life .
B :  And um so , maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly
B :  so that uh y you know sen send power to it .
B :  So uh or maybe uh set it out in the sun and it uh , you know , gets uh , from the light , um a a solar cell inside there so that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things .
C :  Hmm .
C :  It seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it's a great feature , but if you're watching T_V_ , there's a lot of ambient sound , and it's words . It's not just , you know , noises like something hitting .
C :  It's actual speech , so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the T_V_ speech , and the the user's speech . Otherwise , you can say remote . But if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of a sudden , you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies ,
B :  Off .
C :  because they've triggered the remote control and it's turned off your T_V_ .
C :  So , I think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems , then yeah , it'd be a really good marketing gimmick . But , I think we seriously need to consider how that would impact
D :  Mm .
C :  the situation .
B :  Very good point .
D :  Because tha w with speech recognition uh th I'm not that good at that idea but th
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  if it's a one-word recognition , 'cause I know with telephones and cars and things I've seen in the States , a friend of mine says call Mom , and it calls up Mom .
C :  Yeah .
D :  'Kay the radio can be on and everything .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
D :  Because I think s with speech recognition , if uh the the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I don't think it would come through a sentence in a television .
D :  If somebody's speaking on the se the television , they're not gonna stop and say remote , okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So I think that uh something could be designed to recognise single word
C :  Oh yeah . Yeah .
D :  Like the t like the telephone .
C :  No , I think it's a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements .
D :  No because I this is this is years ago in the United States where we're driving down and he said call home , and the telephone called immediately so well , that's kinda cute .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Well , what I can uh suggest to you , Christine , okay , uh if you need some uh the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition ,
A :  I can recommend you some companies like uh Intel or I_B_M_ , okay , because they're already in this uh speech recognition part , okay .
A :  And uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie-up .
A :  Okay , and uh if you want , I can coordinate , okay , to get some information , okay , and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require
A :  okay , to add this feature
A :  in this project .
A :  I don't think it's uh the difficult .
A :  And uh we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop ,
A :  apart from uh what today .
B :  Okay , we'll find that out .
A :  Yep .
D :  From from your side uh , you're gonna have to go back the management and s be more s precise . What do they want ? Uh , a risk , take a risk on the market ? Something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ?
A :  Yes .
A :  Yes .
A :  Yes .
A :  Yep .
D :  Because it has to be something totally different , has to be total totally new . Something that nobody has right now .
D :  And it's gonna cost .
A :  Yeah but but end of the day , you're the sales guy , so I will come back and sit on your head because uh you are going to give your sales projection , okay .
A :  It's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us and how much you are going to benefit , okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Sure . Sure .
A :  And uh , so I don't mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of
D :  Obviously .
A :  the money from this project . Yes , okay I don't mind to convince the the management , okay .
D :  If the bottom line is positive .
D :  Mm .
A :  The management says , okay , so they they don't want certain facilities , which it's already worked , okay , they want something uh new , okay .
A :  I think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree , I don't think they'll say no for that , okay .
A :  And uh I hope I can convince the management on that , okay .
A :  So if you have any uh new ideas , okay , for uh your you can always come up and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special , okay , coordination , okay , between any uh technical companies , which you can uh hide their technology backup ,
A :  okay , for your uh functional design or technical design , okay , then I am ready to do that .
A :  And uh what's your comments about uh
C :  Um well , I mean , maybe if I go through my presentation , you can sort of see what the user perspective is , and how it ties into the other two comments .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , so you are finish , Ed , uh so I can uh
D :  Yes . Mm .
A :  Okay , I'll uh hand over to Agnes .
A :  Just gonna close this . T
A :  Uh where are you , here ?
C :  Mm participant three .
A :  Participant three .
C :  Nope , here
A :  Okay , so I'll yep .
A :  Okay .
C :  Good .
C :  Thanks . Yeah , and that's fine .
A :  Is it okay ? Alri
C :  Okay . So , basically , the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . So , in our case , existing remote controls .
C :  And then , what the good ideas are , and what the bad ideas are , and why they're bad and good , which isn't always as obvious . We seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case .
C :  Then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , 'cause that'll feed into both Ed's work and Christine's work .
C :  Um and then what the remote control should look like , obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are .
C :  So , in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off . You need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . You need to be able to control the volume and then control any menus on the T_V_ to regulate contrast or whatever .
C :  So , the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general .
C :  The buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do .
C :  Um often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often .
C :  And that the buttons are too small .
C :  So , here we've got two examples where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . The buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny .
C :  Um they're hard to see , and okay , they're labelled , but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much .
C :  Whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control that I think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed . And it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . So , I would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this .
C :  And if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons .
C :  So my personal preferences are to keep the number of buttons to a limit , or to a minimum , sorry , make frequently used buttons bigger and more strategically placed , so like the on button being really obvious one , the channel changing and the volume , and to keep the design basically sleek and simple .
A :  Click mm .
C :  Which , I think ties into what Christine and Ed have both said fairly reasonably .
C :  Um so , that's pretty much it , an
C :  I don't know if you guys have any questions or
B :  Oh , it's um , seems very understandable . Clearly your research and uh and ours uh heading in the same direction , and um uh
C :  Yep .
B :  the only thing that I saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it .
C :  Yes , that's true . Yeah .
B :  So uh , you know , but that's okay . That's why we're all here at the table , so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and um w we it's complementary .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh , when you hold it , is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design
C :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
B :  and that's logical and normal 'cause those are the parameters that an Industrial Designer's more thinking about , th th the look and the feel , and uh , you're
C :  Yeah .
C :  Oh , that's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases , I think .
B :  First . Yep .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay , so I don't have any questions .
B :  Sounds good .
A :  So for anybody need uh any help , for time being , on this uh subjects , okay , so please come back to me , and uh Christine , maybe I can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies to help you for uh make a design uh slim , okay , and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all .
C :  Oh
C :  Should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include , 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , but
A :  Yeah .
C :  do we actually want to incorporate all of them , or have we missed anything ?
D :  Hmm .
B :  Do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide , maybe that would provide some guidance ?
C :  Sure .
B :  Doesn't really tell us .
A :  So not really this one we are talk ab
D :  Individual actions .
B :  Well it says individual actions , it says user interf so I'm supposed to do the components concept ,
A :  Yep .
B :  supposed to work on the user interface concept , and you're supposed to keep watching the trends .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach .
B :  I think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now and eliminate them later in the process , that's my suggestion .
C :  I thought
A :  Okay , that will be great . And uh I'll send you the the minutes of meet
B :  You can object if you want to
C :  No , I I'm just thinking in terms of time , like if
D :  She's objecting .
C :  Yes , now I'm objecting . No , I mean , I was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ? I mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , um
A :  Yeah .
C :  and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want , but
D :  Oh th we s we still have
C :  I guess
B :  I think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting , 'cause w our meeting time has run out . Somebody else has go to use this room , and , you know , we can't hang out here and talk about this , so
D :  Yeah . Right .
C :  Sure .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Sure .
A :  Okay , what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break , okay , then uh we can discuss furthermore , okay , with our areas , and uh then we will come back again in the in the next meeting .
A :  So thanks for coming and uh I'll send you minutes of meeting , and uh please put your all information in the sharing folder so everybody can share the information .
A :  Okay ?
C :  Okay .
A :  So let's go for lunch then .
D :  Agreed .
B :  Thank you very much .
A :  Thank you .
A :  Okay , is everybody ready ?
C :  Yeah ?
D :  Yeah I'd to just put on my microphone here and I'll be right with you .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay ?
A :  Um I take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do and um
C :  Mm ?
B :  Yes .
A :  I think the Marketing Manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires .
D :  Okay you want me to start right now ?
A :  Yeah , mm-hmm .
D :  Okay . Well , could you um put my slides up 'cause I think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time .
A :  Okay .
A :  You're participant four .
D :  I'm participant four I believe . Yes uh-huh .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Okay , and now I can uh full screen .
C :  Open .
A :  Uh , okay , okay .
D :  There we go . Okay well I think we have introduced ourselves , so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal but why don't we pass right to the second slide .
C :  And then full screen .
D :  Cause that's where m my discussion starts . Right well um since I'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since I have to try to sell it . Um I thought that the method I should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , and th the reason I just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage I think I should just be open to lots of suggestions . You know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your C_D_ whatever you want it to do um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  'Kay .
D :  So I'll be coming to you um frequently as the Industrial Expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do . So in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another , and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those . So that was um what I meant there , and as I said on the slide there consulting the Industrial Engineer about that and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , because if we're gonna sell this thing , I think the best time to sell it is as a Christmas present .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm hmm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Twenty five Euros makes a nice little present , and we want it to be an impulse purchase , we want somebody to see it and think it's , gee I just gotta have that . And take out their wallet and buy it . So it's gotta be really attractive and it but it's gotta go to market by September , 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in September showing it around , isn't gonna sell for Christmas . Um and then I'll be coming to you as the User Interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour and I'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  So I'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you , and I'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know , what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle , 'cause we gotta sell this sizzle . A lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for Christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever . Okay can we go to the next slide please ?
C :  Mm mm-hmm .
B :  What features .
B :  S sellable . Yes .
B :  Yes .
D :  Alright I I already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . So I'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where I was saying we we could suggest anything . I'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control what'll be And then I found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . At the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the T_V_ , the V_C_R_ , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp . I have to wind up ?
A :  Uh okay , can can I at this point interject um something ? Um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered . Um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext , because that's sort of outdated with the internet , and according to to higher management the it should only control the T_V_ , mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things , and they are concerned with the time to market .
D :  Yeah , sure .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Complicated , yeah , of course .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Of course , yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Um and the and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . So I just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at . These were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things , so it's only gonna be T_V_ , but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea .
D :  Okay , so that's something
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay so
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm 'kay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Alright , thanks for that . Um alright now other things that I found out on in my research is that the complaints that people have about the remote controls that are out there now . 'Cause a lot of them take too much time to learn how to use , and that was thirty four percent but even more important the thing that we did address in our last meeting that frequently it's lost somewhere in the room . Um so those are two things that we definitely do wanna address , uh we wanna s make it as simple as possible , we wanna make it um obvious and intuitive to use , and then the things about finding it we talked about the a light emitting thing as well as uh maybe a beep , and I think that those are things after my research that we definitely wanna try to incorporate . 'Kay can we go to the next slide please ?
D :  Okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . That is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase . Uh because once there's no be-back , well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back . If somebody says , oh I'll come back and get it next week you're dead . They're never gonna come back and buy it . You've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing .
D :  And , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use . We have to have as few buttons as possible , because more buttons is more confusion , so that's why I'm saying , simplicity is good . Finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it . So we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , and I've already said this several times but I put it down in writing here , it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five Euros . So it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five Euros I'm not gonna take that . Has to be so great that they're gonna say , uh twenty five Euros isn't much . Um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . Okay that's uh about it for me right now .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  And uh
A :  who would be next , uh , I guess that would be you . Mm-hmm . You want me to get your slide show up ? Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah 'kay .
C :  Yeah yeah sure . Thank you .
A :  And you are number three ? Number two .
C :  Number two , yeah .
C :  Yeah exactly .
A :  Okay .
C :  Uh can you make it uh full screen please ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
C :  No , it's like a well you you have to press here .
C :  The cup cup shape here ? The thir third .
A :  Yeah yeah , uh-huh .
C :  Yeah exactly . Uh so today I'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . Um can you go to the next sli slide please ?
A :  There , mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  The metal is like uh in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . It takes the power from a battery say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . It should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want and then um uh th this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a T_V_ or a air conditioner , something like that so .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . If you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency the device should know what the frequency is . It should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal , and the T_V_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control and uh so uh I think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices .
D :  Signal .
B :  Receive .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Multi-purpose .
D :  Yeah well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook .
A :  Yo and it's yeah but it's so .
C :  Uh yeah .
C :  Um .
A :  Yep .
C :  So uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages like there should be a user user in interface like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . So uh you can control whatever you want , you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh T_V_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and T_V_ can perform the actions .
D :  Mm okay .
C :  So can you go to the next slide please ?
D :  Okay .
C :  So I I just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller um I think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also , it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so . And there should be a child lock , like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . If make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but I think it's possible but it uh yeah yeah yeah so it's it's okay , yeah , yeah . And uh different shapes that we can do like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands and um so that uh
A :  Yeah well yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated , so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now . Mm-hmm .
D :  Well we already eliminated that .
B :  Eliminated .
D :  Now that's good from a marketing point of view , the fun the fun shape . And that you you say that won't add too much to the budget ? To d the shape is uh
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah and colours also , different colours , and
A :  Yeah I
B :  Mm-hmm colours .
C :  No no no , it won't uh I don't think it will be like , you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more
A :  It just build a mould basically and uh you know .
C :  Yeah yeah . It's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter .
B :  Yes exactly .
A :  As the budget we're looking at if you build one mould I don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or
C :  Yeah .
D :  Do you think there's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ?
C :  Yeah that is also possible I uh yeah I I yeah .
A :  Oh yes .
D :  Is that gonna be a possible ? 'Cause that might help with the marketing .
B :  Yes .
A :  I think I think we will have to look at the budget on that but I think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun , you know .
C :  Yeah that will be
C :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of silly for children or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Silly for children .
C :  Yeah , for children , yeah exactly . Yeah , that's what , yeah .
A :  Like an animal or
B :  Like a doll , or
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , exactly . Yeah . And and the butto buttons also I think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . If there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . If you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive , so I think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations , like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . So if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but I think it will complicate the matter more I think so .
B :  Yes .
D :  Mm .
D :  Well , I think I think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the User Interface person because I think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . Because I think one of the things were complaining about in my what I found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . The changing modes was something I mean you and I , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time , changing modes is nothing for us , but people who
C :  Yep , yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , it's like you know yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , a little elderly , a little arthritic hand you know , and and it's a small button and and it they don't press it exactly you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else and they're very frustrated you know .
D :  N and
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yes .
B :  Something else .
D :  And that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel , and um you don't feel the mode change . So um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too . You know , like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it . But we'll get to that with you .
C :  Yeah , yeah you don't us yeah yeah , usually . Yeah .
C :  Yeah shapes also , different shapes . Yeah that will
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Channels .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah , and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh
A :  Mm , mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
D :  That's right , yeah . Now that's a good point . Yeah .
C :  So yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  And uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock it I I don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit I think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's
D :  Yeah , that's that's a good that's a good one , because the clock would be really friendly , and and when is your favourite show coming on and
A :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Yes .
C :  Yeah , and we display a clock .
B :  Mm yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yes . Yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh
C :  Yeah , and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so
B :  Yes .
D :  Yeah , and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute . Yeah that's that's good , the clock is good . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Uh can you go to the next slide please ? Uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch . And uh bulbs . Like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the T_V_ is on suppose , then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Then it will be like if you switch on your T_V_ through anoth another source , not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . Maybe we can have that . Whenever the T_V_ is on , remote controller will have a light .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And then uh infrared bulbs . Um this is like uh when it is dark .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And battery , there should be a battery for power supply , and a chip , chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , and wires connecting all chips , which is uh lights , everything , so there should be wires .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  And uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape . Yeah .
B :  To keep the remote ? Yeah .
D :  Case .
B :  A case holder . A holder remote holder .
C :  Yeah , holder .
A :  Holder , yeah , mm-hmm .
C :  Um uh can you move onto the next slide .
C :  Um next sli slide please .
C :  Um I have referred the site uh the homepage of the um our website , uh from where I have uh uh I got s few points .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That's it , that's it from me now .
A :  Okay .
D :  So it um we should visit this site and have a look at uh what's up there ? Or
C :  Um .
A :  Well , you don't have to .
C :  Uh it's not like that , I have referred the page to get new ideas or like what can be the working design to how it works and all and so and so .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay . So it might be helpful if we had a look at that .
C :  Yeah if you want .
C :  Yeah , it's okay .
D :  Okay , thank you .
D :  Could you go back to that slide where she had that uh s slide up Betsy ?
C :  Uh , it's actually there now , there on the screen .
A :  This one ?
D :  Yeah , okay , thank you .
A :  And Francine ?
B :  Participant two .
A :  You are number two ?
B :  Yes . No no , I'm three .
A :  You're three .
B :  I can make it full ? Yes yes yes . Okay . As uh User Interface Designer I did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . Yeah can you please go onto the next slide ? So I found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance .
A :  Would you want it full full screen ? Mm-hmm ? Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Now for that , uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the T_V_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the T_V_ . There should be a signal uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a LED which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice .
A :  On the on on the remote . Yeah , mm-hmm .
B :  Yes . Yes .
B :  So if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the T_V_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time . So he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel . And uh the uh the uh and the one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yes .
A :  By your child , mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Uh t the remote should be compact and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the T_V_ television . And um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a T_ in alphabet for more compactability .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And uh and uh and it is one more point which I noted it down , like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person . And it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight P_M_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , and I don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm , 'kay .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , sure . If there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And an alarm clock , yeah that should that should be okay .
B :  Yes , and as John Reece said the buttons can be , uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently . So in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel .
B :  And uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections so that if a child plays with a remote , he uh he should not be harmed in any way .
C :  Hmm .
B :  And findings , uh I found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used , there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions and there are uh
B :  So uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television .
B :  Next slide .
B :  And these are my few personal preferences like it can be used for a multipurpose use . Not , uh no uh like it can it can be used as a T_V_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing and it should have a child lock , and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that . And if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it .
C :  It's like a t okay , it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television .
A :  Timer , yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B :  Timer . Yeah and then you can use a timer as well .
B :  Yes .
B :  Yeah that's it .
A :  Uh okay , now I have
A :  On my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda , and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that . However uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . And uh what function , working design , how how does it work . So these are the two things we should come up wit with . So uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um .
A :  I guess in many ways everybody .
A :  Everybody who has a T_V_ .
C :  Mm , T_V_ , yeah .
B :  T_V_ television we was .
A :  Yeah , and I think today there are probably not many people who don't have a T_V_ . There are a few but in general not .
C :  Don't T_V_ , yeah .
A :  Now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , but I think within the target group we have subgroups . We have we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , so I think that's uh one group that's certainly important . Um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear . And uh I don't know how much we want to cater to children's use . I mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  So this these are just some thoughts I have on it , and um I dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well you know there's the old motto , children under six never shop alone . So if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  That has a lot of that has a lot of appeal but I think uh I'm I'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups . I think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . You know , like you make it nice and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever you know yeah , for example you know . But the question is really , who is our target group .
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  That's right .
B :  Different colours .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
D :  You can make a banana shaped one .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Do we look at one target group ?
A :  And with the twenty five Euros you know can we can we afford to have uh I'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at
A :  sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group how much would that throw us
A :  out of the cost we are supposed to respect ?
D :  Respect . Mm .
B :  Okay . No uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes .
A :  Right .
A :  With with
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  We can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know . yeah .
A :  Well that's that's
B :  But in a family in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes . They would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh
C :  Children and everybody , yeah .
C :  Yeah of course that we can do , but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know .
D :  What about the electronics ? That's not really gonna change much , is it ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Cost effective .
C :  No , it it doesn't cost , yeah .
A :  No
D :  That that w that won't change much , will it uh ?
C :  Yeah . Doesn't doesn't doesn't matter .
A :  The the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function , and I think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups . The question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . I mean the basic design I understand will be the same , but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example .
D :  I d I wouldn't think so .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So that remains to s to be seen but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a T_V_ .
D :  That's right , and can we can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ? Um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case . And in that case we could probabl moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it ? Um you as an industrial person ?
B :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , well that's that's the question .
C :  Hmm hmm .
C :  Uh no . Mm , I I I don't think no . It's not .
A :  Well maybe there's there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ? They have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , and maybe something like that , that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package . And then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Well there's a real idea yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
C :  Yeah , like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that .
A :  You know , yes .
B :  Um
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
A :  That's right , and but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , then they can go to the store and for a few uh Francs or Euros whatever they can buy an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know .
D :  Uh yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  An alternate package .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
B :  But uh yeah I I have a doubt like will it be cost wise effective if we if we design a remote having all the uh different features for different people or designing three different um remotes for three different categories of people .
A :  Well I think I think the idea here is to uh to to d design one remote and what the only change is gonna be um the funct d t yeah uh the functional functional cosmetics if you want to put it that way , um having maybe larger buttons or buttons that light up or buttons that are slightly differently shaped for people uh either for children um
C :  Yeah , but uh
D :  Well I think we can only aff , yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Cosmetic .
B :  Of th okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Five minutes that was I guess tha that's the old message .
D :  Warning , finish meeting now .
A :  Finish meeting now . Um um .
D :  Well we may have to come back to one or two of these points at our next meeting but um
C :  Yeah , maybe , yeah , yeah . If we do some more research , maybe we .
A :  But I think I I think to sum it up the target group is basically everybody . If money permits we can address some features for some subgroups within that .
B :  Okay , mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm yeah , I think maybe seventy percent is a unique uh uh remote controller and thirty percent is yeah it's sort of like yeah .
A :  Do we agree , do we ?
D :  Okay but we have to l
A :  Do we agree on on that in principle , like money will tell whether we will be able to do that or not .
C :  Yeah , yeah , of course , yeah .
D :  Okay , fair enough .
B :  Yes .
A :  Okay ? So now I understand it's lunch break .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And um .
A :  So that's what we will do .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  So hank you very much .
C :  Thank you .
A :  And we'll see you after lunch .
B :  Is that alright now ?
B :  Okay .
B :  Sorry ?
B :  Okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? Okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design . All ready to go ? Okay . Um so hopefully you've all been working away , and I've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . Um so I guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time . Um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s
D :  Could you plug me in ?
D :  Okay . Thanks .
D :  Okay .
B :  Um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , um which is the The first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . Nobody uses teletext very much anymore , so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . Um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ or anything else . I think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . So um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the T_V_ . And the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Um I'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . It might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere .
D :  And the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ?
B :  Well that's the thing , I'm I'm not sure um
B :  uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say
D :  'Bout putting the fashion in electronics .
B :  Uh something
B :  Yeah , I mean do they Is that something they want actually written on it , 'cause it's quite long .
A :  Mm yeah .
B :  Um or yeah , just the idea , but I'm not sure . So that's something we can discuss as well . So those are the three things , just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the T_V_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . Um so is everybody okay with any of that , or do you want me to recap at all ? Right um , time for presentations then . Who would like to go first ?
A :  Nope , we're all set .
C :  I'll go first .
D :  Sure .
B :  Okay , cool .
C :  Alright um , can I st steal this from the back of your laptop ? Uh
B :  Oh yeah , of course , yeah . G go on ahead .
C :  so this is the technical functions design .
C :  Um
C :  Right to do the um the design I have I've had a look online , I've had a look at the homepage , which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products . Um I've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer and um I would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . Um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Right .
C :  Um , having a look at the existing products , I found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . Um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . Um there's an example I'll show you at the end , um sh show you now .
C :  Uh
C :  here um the button there and there . This one's prog . Sorry . That one's perg and that one's prog , and it doesn't really tell you what it does .
B :  Alright .
C :  Um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . Um it's a very simple one . It's got only the basic functions mm but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one . Uh it looked a bit clunky . They're very big and not very much use for buttons . Um , and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . There's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button .
B :  Oop .
C :  Um , my own preferences , I prefer the the clunky one . Um it's very easy to use . Um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions which I I quite like having on the controls . Um so I believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , or something like tha from the bottom of it .
C :  So , now I'd like to ask for your preferences . Um not sure of how long we've got , uh
B :  Um . Well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so I think at at most . Just a couple of minutes anyway .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  M yeah , like a lot of a lot of what I've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what Craig's just gone over . So in part I could I could give you some of my personal preferences but I could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research . But anyway , um we might come to that later .
B :  Mm-hmm . Shall we sh well we'll stick to kind of your area for now .
A :  Which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. .
C :  Um , the clunky one is the one on the right .
A :  Okay .
D :  Um clunky in what sense , like um h heavier ? Larger ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Um I think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons . It's , you know , it's very spread out and kind of you know , I get the idea it'd be sort of about this size . got very few buttons on it and
D :  I see , so it's more just basic . Right , okay .
B :  Looks kind of Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Sure .
B :  Well I think it's a valid point . I mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , and that P_R_T_ p P_R_O_T_ thing is incredibly confusing . Um so I see I see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , so maybe you know you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , I think that's a good idea . I think it's a good idea .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um , do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ? I mean so far I've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . Um they're just the the very basics you could use for a T_V_ .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Uh-huh , and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah .
C :  Okay . Um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? Would you like um the channels like the the numbers on thing , um
D :  Which was that ?
D :  Up the numbers , or the up down ?
B :  God , I wou I would say that's required , I mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , I mean would anybody disagree with that ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um , what else , uh So don't need to worry about teletext , don't need to worry about V_C_R_ , uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , you know like brightness and contrast ?
D :  We don't ? No ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well I think I think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . We're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? Is that right ? Is that what we're we're doing ? We're kind of like sorting them an Or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ?
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Um , yeah .
C :  Um
B :  I think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ?
C :  Uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , um we need to find out exactly what we have to have um and after that we can add things if they're possible .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay , right . Well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this . Um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yep .
C :  There's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers .
B :  Right okay . Um
D :  Well , one one way I would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . Uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . For example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . Maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , things like channel and volume um are used all the time , so we just have them right out on top , um very just very sort of self-explanatory . Um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . And others that are uh also available and then others that are concealed . Something like that .
B :  Mm-hmm yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay . Uh well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section Have I just lost Oh no . Um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , maybe like a mute button , that sort of thing . Any of you anything to add to that at all ? No .
D :  Yeah .
A :  No . I'll add it later , I guess the presentation .
B :  Okay , right . Um okay , if we can move on to next presentation then please . Um
D :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
D :  Sure .
C :  Do you want to switch places ?
B :  Do you wanna
D :  Can this can this pl reach ? Can this plug come across ? No .
A :  No . No .
B :  Probably not , actually .
D :  So why don't I just pick up and move then .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Here , I'll just
D :  Why don't I just
D :  Mm er , can you go up behind me ? Kinda This is so This I'm all in a knot now .
C :  Just just switch them .
B :  bit complicated . It'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ?
D :  Okay .
B :  Right .
D :  Um . So I can I can say already , I dunno whether this is for good or for bad but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things . Yeah , yeah . Which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , but may what I've already started doing is cr I created a slide in in my presentation here so um so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , because certainly I I have a hard time separating separating things completely . Obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that I've been So how do I how do I get this up ? Okay .
B :  Oh , like overlap between what you said ? Oh well , for all you know that that'll happen .
B :  Mm hard to know what where your role ends , yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um function F_ eight .
B :  Uh pr yeah , press function and F_ eight , yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Alright . So
D :  F_ eight ?
A :  Function , the blue button . Next to the control on the left . Yeah . You have to push it together .
D :  Oh , and F_ eight . Okay .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
D :  Okay , I think that that's doing it now .
A :  Nope . Try that again .
D :  Uh , again ?
C :  Think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose .
A :  Wait .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , you wanna
D :  Um , okay great .
B :  Oh oh here we go . There you go .
A :  Yep , there we go .
D :  Okay . Just um Before I bring this up what I'll just say is um what I've what I've done is tried to collect some information so that I can then relay this to to you guys so that it's now becomes a collective thing . And then kind of lead us in the direction of deciding , 'kay what what are our options , what should we decide and do you know what I mean , so .
A :  Increase that 'cause we can't see the
B :  Um
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  That's much better .
B :  Right .
B :  Can you um
A :  There you go .
B :  Right , okay .
D :  Okay . Alright . That would be
D :  Okay . So um does that make sense ? So what I basically got is I just looked into some information and sort of th tried to think about how how we could review it and how we could and what kind of decisions we could take away from it and then maybe by the end of just looking at some of these things we can think about what are our priorities . 'Cause certainly there's lots of different information to go through . So um I'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , that we start with the customer , and w you know , what they want and what are issues with with um existing products . Uh to think about trends and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision which is about fashion in electronics . Um and then , as I say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this and um
D :  Dunno . Okay . Um . So this is what I've found here , um a lot of this is new to me , so we'll just read through together . Um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . So they find them ugly . Most people find them ugly . Um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . Okay I'm gonna we'll look at that in a second . Um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . So I guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , they tend to use the most simple controls and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them .
A :  Bouncing on top .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So I think what we're doing is we're trying to take like if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . And in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . Um , frustrations . They get lost a lot , s as it came up in our last meeting . Um , takes time to learn how to use them . This is uh why I mention when Craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , or something that is quite explanatory . If you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . Um
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  and I will admit I don't know what R_S_I_ stands for .
B :  Repetitive strain injury .
A :  Is installing a new remote control something that people
D :  Uh , no , that did not come up at all . Um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . I also found that most people would uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . Now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . So I dunno if that's possible we might consider getting into it . Um .
D :  And and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , I think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . Um people uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like . You know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay . So want something that looks good and is easy to use , big priorities . Okay .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , so you know just c looking at what what Craig um Craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this . So if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . You know , it's like like I find a lot of T_V_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through .
B :  Mm .
B :  So it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . That's I think it's a good idea .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . That's s that's sort of the um But I I'm my hope here is that I'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . Um I I haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . But not let that confine us technologically .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay . Right .
D :  Alright ? Any um comments on all of that ?
B :  Well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our our target audience , our target market . Um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? I mean
D :  That's uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Where's the money , maybe .
B :  Yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . Well i if if like twenty five Euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , well I don't I'm not really sure how much that will retail at . But you want it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , I suppose , they're gonna actually go out and buy one . So , who do you think we're aiming this at ?
D :  Yeah . And who watches T_V_ .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
A :  Um , I think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . 'Cause twenty five Euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ?
B :  It's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , I think .
A :  Is that too is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? Right . Um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . Kind of . You know how much ? I dunno I guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ? Like a simple replacement , right . I mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , would you how much would you pay ?
B :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah . This this kinda touches on your comments there , David . These are the age groups which we have information on and these are this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . Just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on T_V_ equipment is . Mostly focused around the twenty five age group .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ?
A :  Yep .
D :  Sort of young professional , kind of . Mm-hmm
B :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Um
B :  Um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ?
B :  What what do you think , Craig ?
C :  Well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? Sort of the the older group .
D :  Uh , yeah , it's the
D :  Yep . It does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , in terms of
C :  Uh f
B :  N yeah .
B :  I think we are gonna have to narrow it down , to say let's target these people and give them what they want and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . So um anybody anything there to add Just kind of young professionals , uh th like if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . So we could say that was our target .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Sure .
D :  Sure .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I I think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology .
D :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . Okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . You know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work . I think people who are maybe about I wouldn't say thirty five , but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . So these are people who are gadgety , right ? People who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , when you go on to their working lives , people who would you know regular Yeah . Yeah . Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But yeah .
D :  Yeah , sure . Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  So
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . So they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . That that's that's a good point . Um okay , so um so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition if we can .
D :  Yeah .
D :  If we can .
A :  I I think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . You want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . Speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Why is that ?
D :  Right .
B :  Okay .
D :  Could it be an on off thing ? Like if you want it on Yeah .
A :  Um , but what I'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . So maybe we should I suggest that we think about speech recognition , anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first .
B :  Where you can activate it and deactivate it ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Sure .
B :  Okay .
D :  Sure . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Sure .
B :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Uh okay , well do you wanna um give us your presentation and then then we can I don't know um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , but this is this is how we're Yeah , exactly , yeah . Oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . Um .
D :  Sure . Yep .
A :  Okay , sure .
D :  Yep .
D :  Yeah , it's good well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . Um
D :  Not
D :  Yeah . And not losing . And also it helps in terms of people not losing this , you know they they're saying oh it's I lose it in the couch . like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together that they
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I reckon one problem with speech recognition is um I've actually seen one of them used and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , so you end up yelling at the control for hours . Channel up .
D :  Right . Oh really , you've seen one before .
B :  Really ?
B :  Do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ?
C :  Um
C :  I think it'd probably quite expensive to put in .
A :  Sorry , do you mind passing me my notepad . Thanks .
B :  Mm . Course not . There you go .
A :  Cool , um . Okay . Um . Well this is just the working design um . Well this is just what how I would go about it . Um I guess I try to define like what we're doing now , try to define what we're trying to get done . Um I think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is . We've used it , we're familiar with it , but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like Besides the basics , I think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . Has to change channels , has to change volume , but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . Um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? Um and I just the idea is just to get everybody to um I usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic , so , you know , things that to start everything going . But I guess everybody does have some idea , so I don't think um there's a need for that .
B :  Right .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , so I'll go into the diagram first . It just explains how the process goes through , from a from the basic technology point of view , the basic steps that you need um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . Um okay , you need some power source . 'Kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . Um and that power source is important because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . Um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies um how far you can transmit the signal or the complexity of the functions that you want . Like for example , voice recognition , right . That might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , you might need to power other things , so that's one perhaps constraint there . Um
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Uh-huh .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Th Okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . You know , and that um picks up an input from a user , um uh a logic a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , and the device has to r you know , based on you push button A_ , so I will do something with button A_ . So maybe button A_ is the power button , okay . Um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself which is the receiver here . Um and I think that's about it in terms of my design um . It's fairly general , um and I guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , like um voice recognition , right , um , if it's something which is important then we just add more power rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . So it's not really a constraint in that sense , but I mean these are functionally , you know , the base , what the technology has to do . Um so I guess the rest of it I think we should maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? I think that's more relevant to a discussion ?
B :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Uh . Well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? Are you are you all done ?
D :  Sure . Sure .
A :  Yeah , w I'm done . More or less . Yeah . Ps Oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , but it's essentially the same thing . Um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , you know , stuff like that . Um
D :  Yep .
B :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Right .
D :  Right .
D :  And like on the means b Since we're on the topic of the technology , uh are there any like what are our options ? Alright , what's what i in Is this the only way that we go about it , or are there other thin
A :  I guess this would be
A :  Yep .
A :  Um , these these aren't technology options in that sense . This is just um a basic principles and basic components that are needed . For example , if you needed um if you needed to add uh a voice recognition , right , then your user interface would be split , broken down into more components , right , which you have a microphone , the V_R_ and stuff like that . Uh
D :  Right .
D :  The basic principle of
B :  Okay .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Right .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh . So this just show how we're kind of modularising the whole thing . Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yep . Yep . So each component represents one function , but I think the basic functions are the logic , the transmitter , um and the receiver , okay , and the power are things that you won't have to care about . Um and those are things that based on what your user interface requires then we'll add more functionality to it . Um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the T_V_ for example . Okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? Because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . Right .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Right .
B :  Okay . Well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , so I th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it um because I mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , so we could stay with tha
A :  Yep .
A :  There might be one other problem with the transmission , um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . Um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . I it you may not require that , but you know , um it's it's it's something very natural , I guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . Then you need to send the signal out , so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the T_V_'s at that chair , and I'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . So in that sense , there's not really a restriction but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . Not so much further down .
B :  Oh , yeah .
D :  Right .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah , mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Right .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  And um just a clarification before we finish this . Uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ?
A :  There's there's not much specific specific information , but I think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . Because infra-red is something which everybody has .
B :  Yeah . W Well well we've um In the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the T_V_ , so that's what we should do for now I think . Something I was wondering about was the power . Um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? I mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think , or should we just consider running on regular batteries ?
D :  Okay .
D :  Just to T_V_ , okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  There's a there's Okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , and you add cost to it , um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . You need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . Or you need to get the user to plug it in . Um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . But unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , then I don't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about . Um .
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Uh-huh .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay , so
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , so just stick to to regular
B :  Okay .
B :  Um , right . So basically the um I'm just gonna just recap uh what I said at the start , was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , and what exactly the product's gonna do . So um just to recap on Are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? Um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . Do you wanna recap on that , Craig ?
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , that's good .
C :  Um . I think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . Um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel .
B :  Okay , right .
C :  Ta .
D :  And is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , or are we gonna eliminate those ?
C :  Um I think we include mute , but apart from that um I think we just we'll go for the simpleness .
D :  Okay . R is it is it is it s is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay , I think
B :  Yeah , it's as optional functions .
C :  Yeah .
D :  'Cause what what I'm I'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . I dunno if that'd be a problem .
B :  Okay .
A :  Another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? Um maybe I could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . One would be audio controls , one would be video controls , and the other one would be a device . Um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , but I think that um from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , but I think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a T_V_ is something they see and something they hear , um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . I mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . I mean it might help with the visualisation . And it would actually help with the component build as well .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
D :  Yeah .
D :  'Kay , okay . Like that .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm okay , great .
B :  Okay , right . Um , okay well I gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now . Um next thing we're doing is having lunch . Whoohoo . Um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . Um so I'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder . Um so uh I guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , um for uh our Industrial Designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . Um User Interface Designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . Um and you'll all get specific instructions as well . So um I dunno , just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking . Um , do you wanna start with David . Anything else to say at all ? No , okay . Andrew ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm no , not really .
D :  Um yeah , just I just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea David's proposed , where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . Shall we do that , then ? Okay , great .
B :  Yeah , yeah I think that's definitely a good idea .
A :  Mm .
B :  Uh-huh . Yeah .
C :  Um just about the three buckets , um what would go in the the device functions one ?
A :  Um things like on off . Because they don't have anything to do with what you see . I me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , you know , um so um And channel . Because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound . Not on off video . Although you don't turn off the video on your T_V_ , but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound , say you wanna pick up the phone , there's a mute button , right , so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device . Device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . We put it out .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  And and channel .
C :  Um
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay , so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , anything to do with what you hear , right . You you put that into audio . And then video is anything that you can see . Um .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay , and then visual
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , and then just actual device things , like what channel you're watching , turning on an off , stuff like that . Okay , um
A :  Yep .
D :  Colour , yeah .
A :  Yep .
D :  Sure .
D :  Sure .
A :  Yep .
D :  Okay .
D :  And then k I suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard and then others which are maybe a bit more Yeah . Sure , okay . Okay .
A :  Like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there . Um even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . It's easy to use , I think that's one thing that um and I guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well 'cause things are like fixed .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Um so yeah , I guess just things to think about are you know like the fact it's gotta look good , because of who we're we're , you know , targeting this at . Um something maybe kind of quirky in design maybe . Make it kind of ergonomic kind of to hold , you know , things like that . Um , so I guess I guess that's it . That's the meeting over . Whoohoo .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Great .
D :  Then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us .
C :  Just put it on the deskt desktop .
B :  No on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link .
B :  A well actually just there . Yeah . That's it . If you dump it in there .
C :  Project documents , yeah .
C :  What's your username ?
B :  Your username .
C :  What's your username and password ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Sorry .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Excellent . Right . Hopefully that's us ready to uh to go . So . Functional design meeting . We'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff . Um
C :  There we go .
B :  we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . Not a lot thankfully to say . We introduced ourselves , discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the T_V_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . Um it's come to my attention the following . Teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . Remote control should only be used for the T_V_ . Um
B :  due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . Um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . Um . Now . Just to say quickly uh I would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required . Um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . So to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . Um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . Um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . Um I'd like to if possible hear from our Marketing Expert first , to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . So um I'll just load up your presentation from here if you want .
A :  Mm .
C :  'Kay .
C :  Sure .
C :  Um , sh would you like to I'll just do it from here .
B :  Yep . Sorry . Uh . Is yours the
C :  Um , try second one maybe .
C :  Try it , yeah maybe .
B :  Oh sorry . Okay , right .
C :  Yeah . Okay . Oh , I thought I put in my last name , I guess not , but .
B :  Uh if you that's all right . If you do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Oh yeah , that'd be fine , that'd be great . Okay . Functional requirement by me Ebenezer .
B :  Yeah ?
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay , so um we did some research , we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . We asked some uh open ended questions , just , what are your opinions on the remote control , got a lot of re responses , and we asked some very specific questions , and we got a lot of good feedback . Please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group . Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  So we got some the bad stuff we got , remotes are often lost . I often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . Most buttons are not used any more , like you said , teletext is outdated now . I remember trying to load a D_V_D_ player recently , and there were so many buttons , it took me I don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , you know there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . And if they do , not very often .
C :  Takes too long to master the remote control . I've seen some remote controls that are big , they have a lot of buttons , you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , they're just not great to use . We just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , people do not like remote controls . Some of the good stuff we got . Between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . Now don't get excited yet , I've got more to say on that . Most people'd be willing to pay for that um most people want remote controls to be pretty , they want it to be fancy , th they they want it to be different , everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , not everybody wants that . Finally , my opinion .
B :  Yep .
C :  The voice recognition thing is cool . And uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . It's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , but for a very fixed number of words , you know you have , how many different words can you have for a remote control , up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , you know , how many , you can't have that many words . For a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . I'm pretty sure people would buy it . But after a while people may wanna return it , because if you have to to say som I mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . Using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , and that's for flickering through channels . So if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that and they may return it .
C :  However , oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , there's no need to spend money on research and development , but this does mean the need for microphones in the
C :  in the remote control , which is an unusual feature in my opinion . But if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . See , you could there're two options . Either you have voice recognition by itself , which I think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , or I don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . So you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . But imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , you know , it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . As long as the voice recognition stuff works , that's that's fine .
B :  Okay , yep .
C :  So we have the three birds , we have the design , that we have the the fancy bit , right , the voice recognition's fancy , it's cool , it's different , it's radical , so , and then we have an extra bit I don't remember so I'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , I think is a big question . Um , will people
C :  will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , 'cause I think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , are you willing to have a bad remote control . And uh what if you have visitors come round , they stay the night , they wanna use the T_V_ , they can't use the remote because they speak differently to you . Um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . Uh , will people return the remote control , I think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , you know , so , do our audience have the money , but would they return it after a while because it's not as fast as pressing a button , it's not a practical . So . These are things I think we should consider . I think it's cool ,
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  If you could uh
B :  sor if you could speed it up a bit , yeah . If you could uh speed it up a bit please , yeah . Sorry . Cool .
C :  I'm sorry ?
C :  Sure . I'm about to end , yeah . I think it's cool
C :  but there are definitely some considerations .
C :  So , yeah .
B :  Okay . Excellent . Right . Um .
B :  Hear from the User Interface Designer now I think might be an idea . Um , you've got your presentation now , is it on the is it ? Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  How did where did where did you get all your in information ?
A :  Yeah , it's in the it's in the folder yeah .
C :  There was uh a website , uh ,
D :  Oh .
B :  Technical functions ? No . Yeah .
C :  right here .
D :  Ah , okay .
C :  G I started making stuff up , then I got an email saying
A :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay , this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote . As um is uh the the the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete because I had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices but uh there's still stuff of relevance , so
B :  Okay .
A :  press on . I've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . Um
A :  and wasn't really satisfied by what I saw I have to say so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on .
A :  Um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . Um to save you getting off your backside . Um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . On the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it so about the size of the television set . Um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . And most of these functions are not going to be used , it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . And on the other hand there's a user focused approach that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used . Um
A :  With uh a and a and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . And so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , and um well f the for the most part for T_V_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume . Um and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a D_V_ D_V_D_ or uh
A :  V_C_R_ presumably into that then there's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth . Um .
A :  My own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . Um but uh the pro I think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most . So , something that's uh
A :  something that is more programmable , that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want .
A :  Um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , um I liked Ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , and have a disp you then have some sort of basic display on it so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh
A :  of the um joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . Um , this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers , you know the Playstation control where you have four basic function buttons that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes but the and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified . And so it's taking taking the lead from that .
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  Um .
A :  That's it .
B :  Right . Um , if we could hear from our Industrial engineer , or Designer .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Uh , I was still working on stuff , I hadn't got it finished . Um , alright .
D :  Click to save in where do I have to save it ?
B :  If you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents . If you save it in there we can open it up from here .
D :  Um , what I've done with it , I'm sorry .
D :  Shit .
D :  Um
B :  Are you finding it okay or ?
D :  I'm just closing it now . where I've saved it .
C :  Well like if you go to one , uh whichever one you were working yeah , and you just click file save as .
D :  that's it there , yeah .
D :  Oh right .
B :  Okay .
D :  Uh , right I'm responsible for working design , uh , this is basically the inside going on of the
D :  the uh remote control . So we have the energy source , we have the user interface , this this is what I've seen . Uh the sender will push the button , the chip will respond , uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the T_V_ . So uh
D :  uh , if you go to next slide , you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface . Do we need uh many buttons , or do we need l many light bulbs that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not . Um , , or would that take too much power , would we need more um components in there to supply the power ? Um , the joystick is another thing , if we were gonna add that , um , there'd be more components to deal with that . Um , so uh we need to I dunno exactly what
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  That's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design , but um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface . So , that'll be decided , I guess .
B :  Okay .
D :  Uh , and the next slide .
D :  Oh , yeah
D :  Um , if you go to the next slide then . I just used the it was a mess , uh I was just putting adding it together at the end there . Uh
B :  Oh . Yeah .
B :  Ah , don't worry about it at all mate .
D :  Uh so you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , and the user interface obviously contains everything .
D :  You have the switch turn it on , infrared bulb , uh will contact the T_V_ and will have whatever device or D_V_D_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on .
D :  Uh , so do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , would it be easier ? Um , I dunno what we should decide on that .
B :  Okay . Well . Oh sorry , I'm I'm interrupting you . Are you is it yeah ? Okay . Right . Um , right we can probably skip that for now . So , we've had some stuff put forward , um
D :  No , it's finished , yeah .
B :  along with the new user requirements ,
B :  um we've had a lot of kind of input I'd say so far . Um
B :  I hear what the Marketing Expert's saying about um voice activated control . However I've got a couple of worries about that . The power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues . Um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice , I_B_M_ do um drag and dictate , but these require a lot of memory and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . Um voice activation could be an interesting idea but I think that our Ind Industrial Designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible . Um that's just my view right now , however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an L_C_D_ which has been kind of put forward so far , it's almost like having a small
D :  Cost . Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  'Kay .
A :  Mm .
B :  T_ not T_V_ to say , but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , I don't know how much power an L_C_D_ would take , but it might be quite low ?
C :  Mm .
C :  I uh
D :  L_C_D_ on the remote just telling you what's on , or uh , interactive L_C_D_ or
B :  Well literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone , something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , traverse maybe quite a few menus , if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , they usually incorporate they have the keypad , and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around . That could be one possibility . Um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  I I was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume , left and right for channels .
D :  Do you think that people will get mixed up , like , they'll be looking at this screen and that screen and then , you know , trying to get everything working , would it be a bit confusing ?
B :  We
A :  Um I think probably for the first couple of hours of using it um but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing , um .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  And I think and I think that size of uh display was about what I had in mind . Um though
A :  I mean I w I would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour but we should probably try to stick to black and white . Si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down .
B :  I would agree with you .
A :  Um I mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development but uh you know cost a bit of extra money f w w w w w once everyone's got the first , you know , oh colour's out , we'll have to replace it won't we . It does nothing extra .
B :  Mm-hmm . That would be my feeling as well , I think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface . Um now I mean I don't sorry , go for it .
C :  Sure but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick I think like I h if I was in the habit of buying remote controls then I would want one , but I think we don't have a specific audience , you know , like what is our target audience , what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner . You know , you know what I'm saying , like , for whom is this intended ? Everybody ?
B :  I think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . And that might be just another way of saying try to target most people . Um , if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone I suppose . But that does cover a very large section of the people out there .
C :  Most people , yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Sure . I think that's fair yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Um , I mean I imagine as well that the actual L_C_D_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . Which maybe doesn't get used as often , maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it . Um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , it depends , I mean maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined . So like we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control . So that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do do . And they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the T_V_ and who would normally use the unit . I dunno .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm . I th the thing I like about the uh the uh joystick is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it I mean for for T_ T_ for T_V_ remote alone , you could put
A :  um I mean there are like I say the the the main things people do with a T_V_ remote control is the volume and the channel . You can pack all that onto was onto a single control . Um .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But uh but the but then o uh obviously if uh
A :  you know if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation . I mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most T_V_s these days actually have menus anyway so this would be a fairly rational way of integra
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling . Um
A :  concern about our market . Um , if we are I mean most of the uh
A :  of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation . Um , you've got twenty different devices in your living room , you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them . Um , if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room , um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else . I just think that uh possibly mm .
C :  Yeah . Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well this is a requirement that we have to stick to I'm afraid , this isn't one that I've just arbitrarily decided on . So um this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now . So I can understand your point , and I would agree with you , but this is our design spec for now . 'Fraid to say . Um
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Does that um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  I would say so , yes , because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , and that is a separate unit . Um I think that it I would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now . And until we hear otherwise we should go with just that .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Okay , specifically television .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Maybe we'll hear differently , but for now
C :  So the joystick is just for differentness .
A :  Mm .
B :  It would be ease of manipulation of certain functions , yes . Um
C :  Okay .
A :  Just a thought .
A :  Um maybe then our market should be T_V_ manufacturers , rather than the public .
A :  Try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with
A :  um
B :  There is that possibility , yes . B However I don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , but it might not even be the avenue of the Marketing Expert , that might be sales , who are not in this meeting .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  It's just , the way I figure it , twelve point five Euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that , not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , you know , like if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls . We just
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Is this gonna be enough to to sell ?
B :  Well , something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote , which as you said you've done , in fact we've probably all done . Um , I don't know if it's a gimmick or not , but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm , yeah , I've seen them .
C :  I had one of those , and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up because it it went off all the time accidentally .
B :  Um .
B :  Well the other option of course is that um the well I was going to say clapping , um
C :  The clapping one .
B :  Um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has of course you have to have that base unit , somewhere where there's a button , but maybe it's a button that you attach to the T_V_ . Something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . And that could be something could um separate us a bit . And that way , because we're attaching what would be a small button to the T_V_ , again say what , it would be a small transmitter , um watch battery type scenario I would say , or something that if it was problems enough you could actually even just um I don't power that might be something that we could look into . Yep . Yeah , it's uh putting a lot on your shoulders there , so I mean that could be something that separates us a bit from the market as well .
C :  To a television .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think that's a good idea .
C :  Yeah , that's a good idea .
D :  Yeah
C :  I think so , yeah .
B :  So .
B :  To go on from here . Um we have to decide exactly what we're going to do with the remote . Before we leave this meeting , it would be best to say this is what we're going this is the design we're gonna try and get , this is how we're gonna make ourselves look unique .
B :  Do we go for maybe a remote contro uh sorry , we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the L_C_D_ .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think that's
D :  We're just saying volume . Should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ?
B :  We could use say the left and right for changing channels and the up and down for volume , and
A :  Yeah .
A :  For volume .
D :  Yep .
C :  But we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most . Um , power is used like once per hour , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour , that's by far the biggest one , and then teletext , is still here , that's like fourteen , and volume selection .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Volume selection okay , yep , the teletext we're gambling with , and we're gonna say it's dead , the way of the dodo
C :  No , yeah , okay okay .
C :  Yeah , um
B :  So we well , sorry , we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , L_C_D_ , and then what maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ?
B :  So we're having very very few buttons involved , but navigation around a menu for most things .
A :  Actually how
A :  Actually I would say maybe two two function buttons , the y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button . I mean certainly something I've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Or vice versa . And that's really irritating .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um
A :  The o the o the other dis design constraint I think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , um , so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick , you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb .
B :  Okay . So um we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . Do we incorporate the idea of trying to f locate the remote control again via a beeping noise ?
D :  Yeah , think so .
B :  Do you mind looking ?
C :  Um , I think because it's so small it might be an uh I mean if we only have like two three buttons it might be essential to have to have that
B :  The ability to locate it again . So that would require a um transmitter maybe attached to the T_V_ , just so that it says find me , and what , a basically a small microphone um on the actual unit , can maybe hide it in the base . Sorry ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Light bulb as well , no ?
A :  Oh . So so a small speaker you mean .
B :  Some speaker , sorry , yeah .
C :  Speaker yeah .
D :  And a light bulb ? No . To flash . No .
B :  Um
D :  Nah , you'd see it anyway , if you hear it .
B :  E us we might be better with the sound possibly we could maybe incorporate
C :  W those little key-rings have both , so
D :  Yeah .
B :  th e the true fact , considering the cost of an L_E_D_ , we could just incorporate it anyway . The L_E_D_s can be surprisingly bright now .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Blue ones particularly . Plus that's a nice wee design touch .
B :  Um .
B :  So by the sounds of it , with what we're suggesting so far , your design um the user interface is still quite open , you could go for quite an interesting design . Because we're only going to have a very few key and you've got
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  you know a small L_C_D_ , joystick , e I think it leaves you open to a a potential wide range of shapes , something that can make it stand out slightly . Um if you could look into what we've suggested so far , the feasibility of um small transmitter , um and such , maybe if an L_C_D_ screen requires too much power , or such .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Ebenezer , um , Marketing Expert
C :  Well I can give you the frequency , what people what options people use most often , I guess that's gonna be important in the ts defining the the software side of the interface , right . You want the stuff .
B :  If , yeah if you could maybe as well see what people think about the idea of this minimalist approach that we've taken , where of a joystick to control the very basic functions , and then the idea of manipulating it like you would a mobile . I don't know how easy that will be within the time frame , but could be something we could maybe look into .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Sure . Sure .
B :  Okay . Um any last comments that anybody would like to put forward ? Anything that they think has been missed out . Bit of a wide open question there of course .
C :  Mm .
B :  Feel free to email me if you think that uh we've screwed something up and wanna get it rectified as soon as possible .
C :  Sure .
B :  Right .
C :  'Kay . Yeah .
D :  So I should just look at um the speaker , the speaker and an L_E_D_ . And
B :  Speaker and L_E_D_ for locating , um ,
D :  Yeah , and a transmitter .
C :  Transmitter .
B :  transmitter
A :  Actually one one wee thought about that . Um , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television .
B :  getting the external power source , yep , that's quite true .
B :  Um , and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well I'd say . The electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control , so that's good . Uses maybe gives us a new potential market .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  'Kay .
A :  You know I think I mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that , save us the bother , then that's you know vast amounts of sales . Quite quickly .
B :  Oh , one thing that we've almost not talked about at all , my apologies for that , um , user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here , um it's , I'm pointing at my laptop , what in God
D :  Fashion .
B :  Real reaction , and such . So um
D :  The slogan is yeah , the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics , isn't it ?
B :  Oh , sorry .
B :  My apologies . No it could well be , I've probably missed that . Um , I think that's l almost the last minute thing we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top . So I'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that . But it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ?
D :  'S also look cool .
A :  Mm .
B :  In fact we might like to put a slogan on , and um possibly the two R_s to signify the company . Rather than real reaction .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm . Yeah . I thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button .
B :  Sounds good . And I'd say that that's us for now . Okay .
A :  .
B :  Help .
B :  It's up there ? That screen's black .
B :  Alright , okay . Okay , that's fine .
D :  Oh God .
B :  Are we done ?
B :  Right , okay um , this is our second meeting and I might be a bit all over the place . Um , right our agenda for today , do you want us to give you a second ?
D :  Uh , no that's okay , sorry .
B :  Okay , um
B :  I'll go over what we decided last meeting ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  um ,
B :  we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , T_V_ , video
A :  Sorry .
B :  equipment . Um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . We decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . Um , our budget would have to affect um try not to reflect our budget , um that we might
B :  have a bit of oh oh you can see it , okay . Um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . Um
B :  want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . We discussed a flip-open design , um reducing the size of the control and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that .
B :  Okay . Um , three presentations , I've got written here so
B :  shall we hear from Marketing first ?
D :  Um is it okay if I postpone that til later , I just want to get access to a little bit more information , is that okay ?
B :  No that's fine , that's fine .
C :  Okay , yeah I'll go first . Can I grab the
B :  Unplug me .
C :  Thanks .
C :  What do I have to press ? Oh , F_ eight ?
B :  Um , F_N_
B :  function F_ eight .
C :  Oh right , yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Maybe
A :  Yep .
C :  Yep there we go .
C :  Okay this is uh the working design , presented by me , the uh Industrial Designer extraordinaire .
C :  'Kay , this is where I went a bit mad with PowerPoint so . What the first thing question I asked was what are we trying to design ? Well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the T_V_ to change its state , whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the T_V_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to .
C :  Um , so I decided I'd have a look at what th other people have designed and try and take some inspiration from that . But uh although we will want to be taking
C :  ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out and I thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area because
C :  I'm dealing with the inside really . So um , yeah I ran out of time so I couldn't do this one as fun as the last one . Um and uh I found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the T_V_ presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless and , you don't need to send very much information . Um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . Now our one , I'm I'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue because most of them are powered by triple A_ batteries but those can be quite bulky so I d I didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control . Yeah sure .
D :  Mm-hmm . Could I can I interject to ask a question there , is that appropriate ? You're saying the triple A_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um no no , if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky and that's because of the size of the batteries , they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . Yeah the the well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones but I'm just wondering about power consumption and how much you need to send the data across . Um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . Um , now the ones at the moment are small but I was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Right , the triple A_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ?
B :  They are .
A :  Okay .
D :  Oh I see .
D :  Okay .
C :  Now the main components I came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , uh as I said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller and to turn it into an i uh infrared signal which we're going to use to send the information . Now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the T_V_ unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . And then I was uh just had a quick look at the external design but I d I left that mostly to the uh interface designer .
C :  And so this is what I had as the basic idea of what we wanna do . It's not a proper circuit , I'm not sure if it'd work or not , I'm not even confident that those are the real um the real way you'd wire it up but anyway , we've just got the the power going to the infrared bulb with the chip and the uh U_I_ interface um
C :  which would basically , when you when you pressed anything it would the chip would convert it into some form of I_R_ data which could be decoded by the T_V_ receiver , which obviously means that we're gonna have to conform to whatever
C :  um whatever form of communication that the T_V_s are already using and since that that's another use and reason to use that infrared because that's what all T_V_s use at the moment . And then finally , um we want uh the it to be available to a wide audience at a low cost so all the components that I've put forward are uh low in cost so that that should be good . Um it should should be different enough um from the alternative products to get a good consumer base , we were talking about it before and also just something that I was thinking about , uh because they're small they're also easy to lose so if we could look into some way of d dunno some anti-going down the side of the sofa thing that you could have , I th that was just sort of a general point there . And that's uh yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm . That's a very important part , it came up in our market research findings too so I can refer to that , whenever you like me to present .
C :  Alright okay , and yeah , that's that's what I came up with there , so if you wanna
B :  Okay , thank you very much . Um , would you like to continue on from that ?
A :  Yep .
C :  Ooh .
A :  'Kay . It can be okay , that's okay with me .
B :  Or , maybe move the laptop over .
A :  further .
A :  Oops .
A :  Why's it not working ? F_ eight , right ?
B :  F_ function .
C :  Function F_ eight yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  No .
A :  Mm why's it in the right ?
D :  The plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? No .
A :  Yeah , it's connecting .
C :  No , no yeah it's just .
D :  Meter adjusting .
A :  okay .
B :  Oh , there .
A :  Yeah . Actually mm some of my points might overlap with what William's just mention , but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that and there might be some missing loops in this thing which I think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing because
C :  Yeah .
A :  um , I haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . So purpose , as William already said , I would put it to simplify the interaction with T_V_ to make make it as simple as possible . And to summarise I I would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use ,
A :  rather than having a lot of complex button because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features
A :  like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever .
A :  But we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , will this two features together . So what the concept is to have a flip-top model . The main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . So it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people .
A :  Findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . As we saw we we have to make a profit also so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production mm by fifty million we said ? Yeah , with that I think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um ,
A :  that's so this is if you ask me personally , I would make uh
A :  flip-top with a trendy uh uh design and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that . So in overall a simple and uh
C :  Yeah .
A :  user-friendly design .
D :  Mm .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Uh any comments like , if you want ?
B :  Um , I think we'll chat about it at the end , okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um
A :  Okay .
D :  'Kay .
C :  Yeah sure .
B :  Ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange .
B :  Oh , God .
D :  Have I got to keep this here ? Does it matter ?
B :  Right , okay .
A :  I think you'll have to
A :  You can't
A :  It'll have to this can't be pulled .
D :  I'll have t I'll have to move it won't I ? Uh , whoops . Will it manage ? Bit more , oh dear .
B :  We just do the best we can .
A :  You'll have to push it a bit more .
A :  Yep .
A :  Yeah this is more than enough .
C :  There we go , I've got a bit more of the cable .
A :  Okay .
D :  Oh .
C :  There we go .
D :  Is that okay ?
A :  Yeah I think you can pull it out now .
D :  Thank you , just pull it closer a little bit .
C :  Uh you should be able to and yeah , there you go .
B :  Yeah , you might .
D :  Get it right over , okay , thank you .
B :  Ah .
B :  Look at that .
D :  Okay , um , I'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . Um , so that's where we started , we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , male and female , all age groups from fifteen upwards and um we observed them in the lab , just their general use of the remote control , you can see we had a hundred subjects there .
D :  Our findings , lots of findings , I've just summarised some of them here . The overall thing which I've I've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , so it has obvious design implications there . Um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
D :  Eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , we were quite surprised by that finding , but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . Um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . For example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . So again there's power implications there .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , so again a big design issue there . Um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . Um
D :  the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . Uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use and I think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions .
D :  Um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . You know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . Um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , again that was to aid I think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . Something we didn't put to them , but which I'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . Um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . So thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five and in the older age group it kind of reverses , they're not so bothered with this .
D :  I had marvellous tables and things that I could show you , but I think I'll just keep it simple , if there's any more information I can email you extra details , is that okay ?
A :  'Kay .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  That's fine .
C :  Okay .
B :  Right , um
C :  Huh .
B :  we have new project requirements , um
B :  we're not going to be using teletext , um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . Um
A :  Okay .
B :  our control is only going to be for T_V_ , it's not going to be a combined control , which limits you know all of the different things that it limits the cost for us , but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm , so can we not programme a video with this remote control ?
B :  It says for T_V_ only , so looks like it's just yeah , I think maybe Sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but
D :  Just channel-hopping .
B :  I don't know , what do you think ? It just said , for T_V_ only . But I mean , general T_V_ controls do do video as well .
D :  Would that imply video use ?
C :  T yeah yeah .
C :  I d well I dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g
B :  I mean you bu well som you get com you get combined T_V_ and videos don't you ?
C :  Yeah . If yeah and if you got if you got a Sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the T_V_ anyway so on to on to like the T_V_ hard drive or so .
D :  Mm-hmm , yes .
B :  Mm .
B :  I think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming .
D :  Yes .
A :  Anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um we didn't really look into that but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , I think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on and I think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare . So I don't know if that's something we need to look at .
B :  Mm .
A :  Ten perc
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  Ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing and they're not that great anyway .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  In fact I've just called up that table there , we asked those two questions , the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . Would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen , that's multi-function remote and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? So you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , I think that's just general fear of new technology .
C :  Alright , okay .
C :  Alright , okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , bu
C :  Yeah but um on on that again I just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is so I thought that could be quite a
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh yeah .
D :  Right .
B :  We do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , so I think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing um because it is something I it needs to be the thing that you
D :  Mm .
B :  use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , maybe on the T_V_ you could put like a pack on the T_V_ or something so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the T_V_ and it beeps and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that , but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yes .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  That's a super idea .
C :  Hmm . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . Um so we want logo , we want um
B :  fashionable , trendy , I mean what you were talking about with the marketing .
B :  Um , people paying more for it to look good .
B :  Um , we need to focus on that as well .
D :  Yes , further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . What is um attractive to a trendy New Yorker and what is attractive to a retired South African , I dunno , you get the idea . It's it's gonna vary around the world . At the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ?
C :  Well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs I mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same .
A :  Sure .
A :  Alright .
A :  Right .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Just yeah , yeah .
A :  The features could be same and the body could look slightly different .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  So
B :  What about you were talking about the buttons , um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , but what about , I mean , 'cause we got to make it original ,
A :  Yeah .
C :  'Kay .
B :  what about
B :  um you know with the touch screen computers
C :  Yeah , yeah that's what I was just yeah .
B :  yeah ? Um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button which shouldn't wear out as much either , not sure about the
C :  No , well no 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just
B :  You don't have to press it , you just have to put your thumb onto it . Um , think that might appeal I'm thinking kind of Japan , I'm thinking uh young , um office people , trendy kind of a thing .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm . Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yes it will appeal to sections of the market def
B :  Um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm , mm .
C :  Mm . But also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics uh there's sort of physically different things 'cause um if you've ever seen the X_ Box they had to make two different sized controllers because people in Japan wouldn't buy it because the controller was physically to big because um
B :  Were too big .
C :  they're c uh just generally Japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller which is uh so if you I don't know what 'cause you obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  So , a bigger b okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market . Maybe for U_S_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control and maybe in Japan and all you need to have a small , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
B :  I think we have to design one product and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um .
C :  Huh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely .
B :  It's gonna be the same , so we need to focus on just one thing , not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I'm concerned , when you read the the R_S_I_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , I don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , I think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . Um , R_S_I_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I'm j I really can't get my head round this one , this may have to be postponed to a future meeting but it's something we should think about .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I yeah I was just thinking about how you could combat that 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel and it becomes yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  I know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes I know .
B :  Or a speech recognition , which is extremely expensive , I think that's the only way that you kind of avoid
C :  Yeah , speech recognition , but yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  that kind of issue .
D :  Do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on
D :  a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . Do we really have to go for everyone right away ? Um .
A :  We could focus on the biggest market .
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
C :  Ge uh
A :  If say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ?
D :  And when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people .
B :  We are we're talking about um
B :  the type of company that we're working for as well . That they want um it to be fashionable , they want it to be trendy and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations . Now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , they have a greater population than us young people , but I don't think we're focusing on that , I think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um ,
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  business kind of class type people .
D :  Mm . I'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate and uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this .
B :  Okay , so the remote control functions . Um we've got the T_V_ , we've got the video , now there's um
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , yes .
C :  Video plus .
B :  We could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , is that I always found that really easy when I discovered it , um
C :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  because you've got your general record anyway so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in and it's just a number , it's not a date , it's not a time , it's not a channel , it's not when it finishes , it's not anything like that , it's just a number .
C :  Just whack in the number .
C :  And you w yeah . And you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that , you just need one 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway , yeah .
B :  No .
B :  You've already got the numbers for typing in anyway .
D :  Right , I've not come across that function but it sounds wonderful .
B :  It is after um if you look in the newspaper , T_V_ guide or any T_V_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards and that's the number you put in and it's recorded that it's going to be on on Tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth so you don't have to worry about dates and you don't have to worry about times , um and it has been around for quite a long time .
C :  It's not
C :  Yeah .
D :  Ah , hmm .
D :  Right .
C :  It's been been around for a long time it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things .
B :  No it's not um but I think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that
D :  Superb .
D :  Mm .
C :  Mm . Though if y if you've got something like Sky anyway you can just click on it you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series .
D :  Yes .
B :  Mm .
D :  Right .
D :  Excellent , mm-hmm .
C :  So that yeah . But just to have that function would be would be really good .
D :  Mm .
D :  Right .
B :  Okay so
D :  Can I just run this past you while it occurs to me , I don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing T_V_ remote controls with with their design features , um , chain companies like Carphone Warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones . Is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it I press for this ? Th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm . But the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out and also I mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service but I I'm not sure how much the cost would be of having
D :  Mm . Mm-hmm .
B :  The functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your T_V_'s not doing it .
D :  Right .
D :  Alright .
B :  Taking your T_V_ and your control and saying look this is what I'm doing , it's not working , what should I do ?
D :  Yes
D :  If it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel , but I mean for if there were any more or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for T_V_ and video , we're not gonna put any okay , just a thought .
C :  Yeah , I mean
B :  I think so . Um
C :  I mean instru instruction books I feel c I reckon can cover that .
B :  Instruction manuals . But I mean they're there's customer service , there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to and that way there's no call out charge , there's no extra , t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Department , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Sure .
D :  Mm .
A :  Right . I think it will be too much of an effort for a person to for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Not for such simple functions because we're focusing on that , yes okay .
C :  And they're yeah , they should be f yeah .
B :  Mm . But we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages . It does , you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong and then you try and search through it , so that should be something we think about . Um , what other functions ? We need I'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , but we should think about c 'cause you've got the dilemma between oh batteries , that's what I was thinking about . Mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ?
A :  Simple .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes .
C :  It's the uh yeah .
D :  Sure , okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , but they come with a charger , I mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but
B :  Well they la they they last quite a long time , and if you had uh when you th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . Um , something like that should reduce the size of it .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah and if yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh
B :  Yeah it could be on that yeah , okay .
C :  Yeah on that as well so .
A :  So are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ?
C :  Yeah some sort of docking station or yeah .
B :  Yes .
B :  Rechargeable with a docking station .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So the rechargeable which would be your
C :  Yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine , and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time .
B :  field .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yes , which it is cheaper in the long run as well . Um , th the shape you got trendy . I don't wanna big box with lots of things , you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either , because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple , um
A :  Right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
D :  And we don't w I mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . We definitely an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , we don't want that .
B :  They do .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay so we've got a flip-screen .
A :  Okay .
B :  Um
A :  What I was thinking of a design which Nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . Basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate . That's very strenuous because your thumb is slightly up , so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much , so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Slightly curved , curved .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  G uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like .
A :  So it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't y yeah so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your
D :  Mm .
B :  'Cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that .
B :  Okay .
A :  I wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth .
B :  Can you look into the company logo ?
B :  Um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . I mean
A :  Current .
B :  for example , if it was a C_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague C_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
B :  um obviously into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that's there .
A :  We could look in at that but
D :  I mean look at the mobile .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm . What we were talking is to make it more
A :  rather than like sea-shells , logo could become as you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like .
B :  Well we need to think about how it's gonna look different .
D :  I think that's that sounds a really attractive idea , I've not come across anything like that before , if it kind of yeah and that opens out into your flip-top . Then it's nice t to h you can make it lightweight plastic , nice to hold in the palm of the hand and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that I would think . I think it's a really nice idea and plus you can get you know even though we're using plastic , you can still I mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior .
A :  A sea shell ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah we could look in at that .
B :  Or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . You could have different kind of casings . So you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Less chance of it being lost too , it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament they don't not gonna lose it so much either . It's easier to bit nice to handle .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , that could be the most common design .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  But we can like think of five , six designs .
B :  Right , I think we have to round it up , um
D :  Can I just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that I haven't missed anything . So it's no teletext , it's only for T_V_ and by implication video , our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , um something about Videoplus .
B :  Sure .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  That was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date
D :  Right .
D :  Right .
D :  Right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the L_C_D_ , a reminder about using Videoplus ? So that they have a look at the guide and
D :  Or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , is this just that was an add-on feature ?
B :  It's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . Um it could be it c
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  Right .
D :  Right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? Right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It yes , it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature , you know , drawing attention to that .
B :  And it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , 'cause it's very simple so putting it down in words should be helpful .
D :  Mm , and the rechargeable batteries . Was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um
A :  Yeah .
B :  We've got the buttons but I think we'll work through that with the design of it , um .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm . That's not at the moment a requirement , it's something we're looking at , what preference so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like .
B :  Yes . Yes .
B :  And we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um .
A :  For detection , right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . But there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it so it should be fine and the I the instruction manual , I don't know if we deal with that , um .
B :  I think
B :  Yep , and different from what's out there . Yep , I think that's us .
A :  Yep , I think
D :  Okay .
D :  What would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? Or shall I just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ?
A :  True .
C :  Okay .
B :  I think you might get guidance , but um
B :  I th
B :  Instruction manuals , 'cause there tends to be a
D :  Okay .
B :  demonised thing , u um , they're everyone's got like a big pile of them , but no one really uses them .
D :  Okay .
B :  Um .
D :  Whoops , questionnaire four .
A :  Oops . We should f
B :  Yes , right . Okay .
D :  'Cause we're at lunchtime now I think .
A :  I think it's time for us to
A :  get back to
B :  Right , okay .
B :  I think you can email me , if there's any more questions .
B :  Um and I'll be able to not answer them .
C :  Um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you , however , um there are some changes that I've got from on high that um
D :  Okay .
C :  are a bit uh well w what I didn't actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television . So the all in one idea goes out the window . And they require that the uh actually I'll get to that at the end point number four , um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . So um , presentations , were you anybody got , raring to go ? Raring to go ? Okay . Good stuff .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  Um . So how
C :  Oh I need to plug you in .
B :  S
D :  Wow .
C :  Just about .
A :  It's a inspired design .
B :  Sh do you want me to hold it ?
C :  Uh there we go , just screw 'em on in . Gonna have to swap them round so now , it was function F_ eight .
B :  So , after that ?
B :  F_ eight .
C :  That's the wee blue one .
B :  f oh sorry F_ eight .
C :  Blue one F_ eight .
C :  Should do it , good one .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Uh , me again , Rajan the Marketing Expert . Uh , as we have decided in the last meeting that I have to find out , sorry , yeah sure .
C :  Hold on , sorry .
C :  and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time .
B :  Yeah , yeah . Uh actually , sorry I have to see the other , sorry .
C :  Sorry , uh .
B :  Yeah , thank you . Uh , yes , I have to look at the uh market potential for this product , uh , like consumer likings and everything , what is the potential for this product and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? Then
C :  P press F_ five to start it first .
B :  Sorry .
B :  Okay . Yeah , I can , okay . Uh then uh the methodology I adopted to find out all this was market survey . A a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Jesus .
B :  And what we got was , we found that if you uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . Seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . They are not so good looking . So , we have to put stress on this , uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers .
B :  And yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales .
B :  Uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . So even if the available market goes for the available uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five Euros , which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . Then
C :  Excellent .
B :  And the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated .
B :  Because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because I think I believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . Otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . So this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . So we have to take care of this fact also .
B :  Then .
B :  Uh it was function I want to go to .
C :  Oh you wanna go back ? Just escape .
B :  Uh , escape , okay thank you . Then if we look at this slide , uh these are in your shared documents , you can see , like
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
D :  So , sorry I was just gonna say , what was the question for this ? Or is are you coming on to that ?
B :  Uh , sorry .
B :  Ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . Yeah , these are different age group persons like uh sorry , I can open it in another way .
D :  Okay .
D :  So these percentages are are what ?
C :  Okay . Speech recognition .
B :  Uh , yes . If we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control .
B :  So we can emphasise on this point also like , because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , and I uh and I think that most of the users of the rem uh T_V_ are belong to this age group . So we should look
D :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm . We're als we we're looking at who buys it as well .
B :  Yeah . We can look at that that factor also , so yes .
C :  Uh , which I think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of .
D :  Mm , mm .
B :  Yeah . So , and
B :  And then
C :  Fifteen to twe
B :  Yes .
B :  I think so . Uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . They find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . So it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn .
B :  They need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls . So this is also a very goo uh major factor to loo uh take into consideration to enhance our profits and sales . So um this is all about
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
B :  uh market potential by me . Uh , yes , th thank you .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay , thank you . Um , follow on with Helen ? Yeah please . Oh , so we do yeah . Fun and games .
D :  Yep , sure , that's cool , um
B :  Yeah we have to take that out . Sorry .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Sorry .
C :  Don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough . I think I just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well .
B :  Uh sorry , I have .
B :  Brian , this one also I . Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  I can turn my computer quickly if that's okay .
B :  Thank you very much Brian .
B :  If you want me to help , yeah .
D :  Um , yep .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , and then what do I press , F_ eight ?
B :  Uh F_ eight . Function F_ eight .
C :  Function F_ eight .
D :  Oh right .
B :  Mm s .
D :  Okay , cool .
B :  It's not coming . Function F_ eight , okay .
D :  Oh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . No signal .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Computer .
C :  There you go .
B :  Computer adjusting , yeah .
D :  Okay . Cool .
D :  Okay and then how do I press the the big one , to get it on to the big
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh F_ five .
D :  F_ five and I press that again to get it off as well do I ?
C :  Um , F_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing .
B :  Escape .
D :  Okay , so um I'm the interface design designer , User Interface Designer sorry , uh I'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user and um I'm I'm also I want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours . Okay , and how do I press n just the next button ? The arrow ?
C :  Uh just a left uh
D :  Okay . So um I looked at existing designs and also um the information that Raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . Um and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our T_V_ I think . So um what they like and what they find fashionable . And ergonomics , we said um , I don't know I haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , but um maybe that comes up , I don't know . And the findings , well
C :  left mouse button .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  'Kay .
C :  That can come under Arlo as well .
D :  the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . That's what people want to do . Um , so they need to be included , um , but I've got some pictures here of some leading ones . I don't know how to get to them , do I press F_ five is it ? escape ?
C :  Uh .
C :  Uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar .
D :  Oh okay , cool . I haven't got my glasses on so I hope it's this one . These are two leading um remote controls at the moment . You know they're grey , they've I mean this one's got loads of buttons , it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , and they don't look very exciting at all . Um , personally I prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , um , but there you go , that's what we're up against , and I think we can do much better than that .
C :  Uh okay .
C :  'Kay .
C : 
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  We hope so .
A :  Of course .
D :  hang on .
D :  F_ five , okay , sorry .
D :  Personal preferences . Um , well I think we need to l I think the ergonomics is quite um important , um
C :  Yeah , particularly if we've uh there was a bit in Raj's about R_S_I_ and things as well .
D :  Uh-huh . And um I thought not too edgy and like a box , more kind of hand-held more um not as uh computery and or organic , yeah , more organic shape I think . Um simple designs , like the last one we just saw , not too many buttons and as Raj pointed out , only ten percent fifty percent of people only use ten percent of the buttons , so I think what we can miss out on the buttons we can make up for in design and and how nice it looks .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Organic .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Sales , .
C :  Okay .
D :  Um , hand-held and portable I think is portamint is important because T_F_T_ have just um released um I think is it a a remote control for presentations or uh and a big seven inch big screen , anyway , so um
C :  Yeah it's like a , yeah .
C :  It's .
D :  Yeah , no seven inches isn't that big but um anyway um so hand-held and portable and uh m I thought about other functions for T_V_ but as you pointed out people don't actually want that , so maybe we forget about that .
C :  Right .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And also the company want to keep it stuck to the T_V_ for uh to keep down the production time .
D :  It's for one T_V_ oh right okay , sure . And so the last thing I thought w which I quickly mentioned in the other one was maybe a bit of a gimmick to set us apart from other people , like glow-in-the-dark um which does already e exist but it's not very widely used I don't think . Easy finder with the a whistle function or something , or rechargeable station because it's a pain when you run out of batteries . And I think that , yep , that's it . Okay ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Exactly . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  That's cool .
A :  So uh , I noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , and uh I was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? Um , or if is that a function we want in the remote ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um , I haven't been able to
C :  Um , do you have trouble whistling ? Really ? Ooh .
A :  I don't , but I I know a lot of people do right . Yeah it just I mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ?
D :  Mm-hmm , yeah or some sort of voice
C :  Yeah , I suppose that's true . Well I suppo uh you could y you could have the you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That's costly though . Um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know , uh and then , what would the response be ? It beeps back at you or something ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Sounds good .
D :  Yeah , something .
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , uh let me set this up .
A :  So I plug it in , press F_ five ?
A :  Function F_ five ?
C :  Function F_ eight for the um the uh
A :  Or function F_ eight ?
A :  Okay .
D :  Oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing .
A :  Okay . I think it's uh just to lock it in .
C :  Yeah .
A :  It's got it .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um .
A :  So as the Industrial Designer my job is to take an input from you guys , um so it's good you went first , and I jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others .
C :  Alright .
C :  Let's remember that .
A :  Um so Raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . Um , a lot of the buttons aren't used , and uh
A :  he mentioned that they're not fun to use .
A :  And uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , there could be a little microphone on it , and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here I am or something of this sort .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Oh yeah , yeah , that's true . Well maybe you could have a
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  um hmm tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . Um .
C :  Sorry I didn't mean to derail you there .
A :  Yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um , and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , um and not computery , right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . So I took these all into consideration and also I have some limitations from the boss .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right um , and practical limitations which I kinda threw out the window .
A :  And so I did a little research and unfortunately all I had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before , which include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains
C :  Ah is that what that is ?
A :  Or uh or a high speed train . Right and having personally worked with all these products uh I have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these .
C :  Well that's cool . If you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah .
A :  Right . So ,
D :  Yeah sure .
A :  I figured , just put 'em all together .
A :  You got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your T_V_ , and um
B :  Hmm .
A :  as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . Give it one button
A :  and and it's a you know , for the the cowboy in all of us I I'm not quite sure what the the function is there but
D :  Well I like that design .
C :  Right okay .
A :  Yeah it's a g I mean you could have a you know a
C :  Is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Right . So I think I I missed the budget thing , it was fifty million Euros ? And we gotta sell twenty five of them ? Right . Okay .
D :  Yeah , not a problem .
B :  Fifty million was uh prof
C :  Ah now it's fif fifty million Euros we've gotta uh we've g gotta make profit , so we're making that at twelve and a half Euros a time .
B :  As a profit .
A :  Oh okay , so I I mixed those numbers .
A :  Okay . Well I guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , cheap plastic uh , you know , um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less . An energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries um , we don't wanna have it
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay . Would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? Is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? Yeah .
A :  Uh .
D :  Or a little base station or something , .
A :  Yeah , yeah , we could do that too . Um , I hadn't thought of that . Yeah .
D :  That might cost more though , 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  I mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , so I don't think it'd up up the price that much .
A :  Right .
D :  A battery in it , kinda .
A :  Right , so so the unirs the user interface uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  behind our product .
A :  Um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about .
C :  Okay .
A :  Um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me .
A :  Um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that and um you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that .
A :  And I suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so uh personal preferences , I think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , uh non volatile memory , just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm that's a good idea actually I like the programmable options .
B :  Yeah , me too .
A :  Oh okay . And the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles .
D :  Mm 'kay .
C :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
A :  That's all I got .
C :  'Kay , thank you very much , um I'll take that back .
A :  Ooh that's tight .
C :  Right , also so um a notice I got not very long before the meeting , so didn't manage to forward it on to you , it is let's see , I'll find it myself , um
C :  Ta nah .
A :  Okay , I don't think we need to screw it in . Just push it .
B :  Yeah .
C :  We had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . Um , dunno what Oracle would have to say with that but never mind . Um it's only for the television , which I'm presuming means it's for a specific television , and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
D :  Corporate colour .
C :  Yellow . I presume . Um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow .
A :  Yellow .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh
C :  I don't know exactly how sort of incorpor I mean , I guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , where am I ?
D :  Okay .
C :  Okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have .
D :  'Kay .
C :  Uh , now , we had as listed options we had
C :  speech recognition potentially , flat screen interface , L_C_D_ interface um
C :  we also want to limit the number of buttons so we'll pretty much take that one as read . We'll use the the basic functions for a television . No teletext . Um okay hold on .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap .
C :  Not enough buttons you mean ? So sorta strike a balance between a a few and a or it looks like we're just cutting on the um
D :  Yeah . Well
D :  Mm .
D :  On the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff .
C :  I do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it .
D :  Mm-hmm , okay .
D :  Okay , cool .
C :  Uh maybe Raj you could find out what people would think about that , or maybe they'll send
C :  some information about that , about um what people , whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . Okay um . So uh I take it your position Arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . Um so I mean a a the sort of inkling I'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that I'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a T_F_T_ display , interactive display . However that does sound a bit like the
B :  About cost .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah yeah .
C :  more complicated design that rav uh sorry Raj um
C :  said people didn't like . Although I guess if there's a sort of If you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of Windows-style drop down menus or whatever , I think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have
D :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  um it goes to a different selection of buttons , so it sorta keeps it simple . Um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Um
B :  Uh .
D :  Glow in the dark material I was thinking . Um , so I I guess that would be cheaper than a light I think .
C :  Okay . So
B :  I
B :  Uh may I say something about ? Uh actually I think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . But yeah are lost and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Often lost s was that , yeah .
C :  Lost , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark . Both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales , so we should take it into consideration also .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That's cool .
D :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
C :  That's cool .
C :  Okay , cool . Um
A :  Well hmm .
C :  speech recognition I take it
A :  Oh it's
C :  I don't , I've I know of no products um that use speech recognition well .
A :  They're act there there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . You could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh B_B_C_ one and it goes to that channel . Yeah , it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . They mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to B_B_C_ one .
C :  Really ?
D :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , or a yeah an advert an advert for B_B_C_ two on B_B_C_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing .
A :  Right , right , and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the T_V_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , but if you can work around that that noise problem
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
D :  'Kay .
C :  Uh-huh .
D :  Well what about this might get a bit too expensive actually , but what about um something that's built into the T_V_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal you know like the ones that we can't hear or something um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . If you find if y
C :  Ah , that's a good idea .
A :  Right .
C :  So like a kind of backwards remote from the telly .
A :  Right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . What you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the T_V_ speaker , or not a remo I'm sorry , a microphone by the T_V_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , 'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their T_V_s .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm . Yeah , that's the only thing , yeah .
A :  But yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the T_V_ speaker
C :  Right .
C :  That we should just stick on , yeah .
A :  which
D :  That comes with our remote control . Yeah .
A :  Right , and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And that's a sort of basic R_F_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap .
A :  Right , right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right , right . Um . Yeah that's certainly possible then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . If you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . You just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , you know to change the channel or to uh turn the T_V_ on and off , you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . And uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job .
C :  Uh-huh .
D :  That could also be built into the T_V_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete .
C :  Yeah . It might do us out of a job . Um
A :  Well , hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve .
D :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Okay . I like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . Um so I think rather than and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , so I th yeah and expense and the time . So I think if we're going to go well I mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the T_F_T_ or the L_C_D_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of
D :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
D :  And the expense .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then
C :  you might have trouble incorporating the screen .
D :  Mm .
C :  Um , but I guess not I thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . Um uh and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? Is that
A :  Um .
D :  Maybe not even all of it 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour .
A :  Mm .
C :  Contrast contra well .
A :  Yeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , and then uh if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , okay .
C :  So if it's dow it's d uh yeah . Or if it's down under the couch cushions um which is where I usually find mine . Um
A :  Right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right .
C :  Okay , well we can use we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , um if we're gonna have to if we're gonna have the logo on as well , bright yellow logo in our our um
D :  Yeah , 'cause what I thought , main
C :  slogan . Uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness .
D :  Slogan , yeah .
D :  Right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  'Cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Alright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then .
D :  That was more of a a gimmick .
C :  Do you think ?
D :  Mm .
C :  Uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then . Okay . Um , okay so scratch that . Uh so we've got do we want to go with the T_F_T_ idea or the is that far too expensive ? Well I mean I think I think the sort of find the finder things I mean it's uh I could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . Um
D :  Yeah , unnecessary . Yeah .
A :  Um yeah we're getting a lot of features now , I I think
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well , I think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , you know they get thrown around , there's a good chance the the T_F_T_ screen would break or uh get damaged . They're pretty fragile .
D :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a T_F_T_ screen ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Um no , I mean that was going on ravs uh Raj's sort of um marketing research I guess . Um
C :  Uh
C :  So we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have .
C :  Um .
C :  So that's sort of
C :  included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um
A :  Yeah mm .
C :  Uh you were finding out about teletext . If you could find out that uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , she they wi
C :  Um I think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a
A :  Oh .
D :  Yeah you think so ?
C :  um expensive , no ?
A :  Oh no it's it's much cheaper than the T_F_T_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits .
C :  Oh right , okay .
C :  Is it not the circuits that cost
A :  And it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , like a
C :  Oh right , okay . Uh well that kind of takes back the R_F_ the R_F_ remote sort of idea as well . Um .
D :  Okay .
C :  Five minutes . Okay . Decisions . Uh , votes , let's vote . Who wants T_F_T_ ?
C :  No-one does . Excellent , so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? Um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design .
D :  Mm-hmm , that's cool .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  And what else was I thinking of that I haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , programmability .
B :  Glow in dark .
C :  Uh
D :  if it's not too expensive s I think it's a good gimmick .
C :  Uh o okay . And also , integrating the , remember to integrate the logo and the s slogan .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay , so . Um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . So , it just helps me summarize them . And um I'll put any I'm I'm putting anything I do in there anyway , so uh
A :  Yeah yeah .
B :  Here ? Sure .
D :  And where is it sorry ?
C :  Uh pro uh project documents .
A :  So it should be when you save
C :  A_M_I_ scenario controller .
A :  on your desktop , so it goes save as , or
D :  Oh .
B :  Uh it is in shared documents ?
A :  And then uh hit that little folder up thing again .
C :  Where am I ? Project documents , yeah , it's on your desktop as well .
B :  Projoct uh projector .
A :  Again .
A :  All the way to the top , yeah that's up to desktop .
A :  Right and then project documents .
D :  Okay , cool .
B :  Hmm . It is not giving anything .
B :  Shared documents .
C :  And I will tr getting strings of um information , I'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , as soon as I get them now , rather than I was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm . Did you get my email ?
C :  I did .
A :  Okay .
A :  Just making sure .
D :  Okay .
D :  What I thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , it's a bit more bouncy , like you said they get chucked around a lot . Um , a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls . The rubber rather than
C :  So
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  More sort of um
C :  flesh-like than plasticky sort of .
D :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
A :  Wow .
B :  Um but we have to take care like
B :  But we have to take care of our children also if they means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful . So , whatever material we use it should be yeah .
C :  Oh no , ethics , that's gonna cost us money .
B :  So we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care .
C :  Okay , safety .
D :  Oh I think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good , um
C :  Yeah .
D :  I dunno , I mean
C :  It sme smells good for children .
A :  We could go comp yeah . We could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And it's got the thing on the inside . And there's no buttons at all , it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works .
D :  That's a good idea . Interesting .
C :  That sounds , yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry .
A :  And then ch children will love it .
A :  Oh yellow , yellow ball . Right .
D :  Yeah , d with the colour , um does it have to be all yellow , do you know ?
C :  Please God no . Um . Well , I wouldn't th I mean , my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so I think just having it
D :  No .
D :  Yeah .
C :  surrounding the logo .
B :  Small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it .
D :  Having a little bit . Okay cool .
D :  Mm mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm , okay .
D :  Cool .
C :  And I'll see if I can argue with boss about putting the what was it ? We put we put fashion into
C :  Whoops , it's not working .
C :  Can't believe I've forgotten it . We put the fashion in electronics . I bet that'll catch on well . Okay , any last
D :  Oh yeah , that's a good one that . Yeah so .
B :  Yeah .
C :  worries , queries ?
A :  Twelve thirty .
C :  Okay . S s I know what you're thinking . Okay then , lunchtime , yay .
B :  Hmm .
B :  That's good .
C :  Okay , that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one .
C :  This is quite fun actually .
D :  Wow . Has anybo oh . Has anybody pressed okay , it vibrates . It's pretty cool .
A :  Mm .
C :  I really don't
C :  Yeah , yeah . Wow you've your first page . I was just writing really big .
A :  Yep .
B :  Check here .
D :  Yeah , got small writing .
A :  Yeah I've been using up the pages .
D :  I don't wanna waste it .
C :  I've finished the meeting now .
A :  Another questionnaire .
C :  Oh , everybody needs k questionnaire .
C :  All hooked up .
C :  Okay , so now we are here at the functional design meeting . Um hopefully this meeting I'll be doing a little bit less talking than I did last time 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . The agenda for the meeting , I put it in the sh shared documents folder . I don't know if that meant that you could see it or not .
C :  Did anyone ? No . Oh well . Um I'll try and do that for the next meeting as well so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . Um and it should be in there .
A :  Mm .
D :  No .
D :  Mm .
D :  Um um wi on on a what ? Oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay .
C :  Project documents , yeah . So I'll put it in there . Is it best if I send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ?
D :  Oh okay , yeah .
D :  Yes , I think so .
C :  Yep . I'll do that next time . Um I'll act as secretary for this meeting and just take minutes as we go through , and then I'll send them to you after the meeting .
C :  The main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , so we'll go through each of you one by one . Um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . I just sent at the last minute , I'm sorry about that , but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . Um and then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be and what the functions of the remote control that's the the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . And we've got forty minutes to do that in .
D :  Yeah , the last minute , yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I would
A :  You said uh targ target groups , what does that mean ?
C :  say yeah ?
D :  Um
C :  As uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , yeah .
A :  Uh okay , 'kay .
A :  So are
C :  So we need to yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself .
A :  Okay .
C :  So with that I think it's best if I hand over to you . Does anyone have a preference for going first ?
A :  Alright .
A :  I can go first , yeah .
C :  You wanna go first ? Okay , so we need to unplug my laptop and plug in yours .
D :  Okay . Hmm .
C :  I assume we just pull it out ?
D :  Mm .
A :  Right . Um so f from the
C :  Just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? Once we you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , just so that I don't have to scribble everything down .
D :  Okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay .
A :  Right sure .
A :  Uh okay .
A :  So n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh I've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote and uh se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w I c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are and how how they work together with each other .
A :  So
A :  this is the method that uh I'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role .
A :  Um the identification of the components , uh and uh since since I'm dealing only with the technical aspects , I would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person . Uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level and uh basically update and come up with a new design , so it's a cyclical process .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay , so these were the basic findings from today . The last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . Uh I just quickly jotted them down . Um so basically uh the as I told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it
A :  uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other . Um okay , so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . Um also uh the remote control should be used only for television , because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex .
A :  And the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . How however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple . Um also the management wants that um our design should be unique uh it so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard .
A :  Okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . Um there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . The user interf interface communicates with the chip , so I'll basic go over to the
A :  Okay .
A :  So if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the
A :  into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . There is a user interface here .
A :  So whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip and the chip then generates a response and takes the response to an infrared terminal , um which then so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code ,
A :  which is then communicated to the remote site , which h has an infrared receiver .
A :  Um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . Um so these are the essent so a all the functionality of the remote control , whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um so i in my personal preferences um I'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . This would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . And uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . That's about it . So anything that you would like to know or
C :  Okay .
D :  Thanks .
C :  Do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? Br
A :  No , I don't have any idea about what each component costs . Um yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Anything else ?
C :  'Cause that's something to consider , I guess , if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might
A :  Yeah .
A :  Certainly , yeah . So so tha yeah , we definitely need to operate within our constraints , but um unfortunately I I do not have any data , so uh I just identified the functional components for that .
C :  increase the price .
C :  Yeah .
C :  That's fine .
C :  Are there any more
C :  questions , or shall we just skip straight to the next one and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ?
D :  I think we need like some general discussion at the end probably .
C :  Yeah , I think that will do . Okay , so do you want to
A :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , I think since since we were discussing some um design issues then I I I would like to continue okay , yeah .
C :  Yes , shall shall we pull this up ? I think that has to come out of there .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Thanks . Oh i
C :  Yeah , I thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst .
D :  Okay , I hope wait . Should it just
A :  I it'll take some time .
C :  It ta takes a little
D :  There's just nothing .
C :  Oh , and have you you need to then also press on yours , function F_ eight , so the blue function key at the bottom and F_ eight .
D :  Oh right , right , right , um
D :  Okay .
D :  Nothin okay , something is coming up .
A :  Oh , there it is , yeah . It'll come up , it um uh no signal .
C :  Now it's coming , computer no signal .
D :  No signal ? Why ?
C :  Maybe again ?
A :  Yeah yeah , it says something now , adjusting
D :  Oh . My my computer went blank now .
C :  Okay , adjusting .
D :  Adjusting .
D :  But I don't see anything I don't see anything on my computer now . This is the problem , but
C :  There we go , there we go .
A :  Okay .
A :  Oh , that's strange .
C :  Oh , if you press if you press function and that again there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both .
A :  Okay .
D :  Um .
A :  And one more time .
C :  Okay , so one more time .
D :  Uh now it's okay . No ? No .
C :  Should yeah just wait for a moment , adjusting .
A :  Mm .
D :  Oh okay .
D :  Okay , that's fine , that's good .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay , let's start from the beginning . So I'm going to speak about technical functions design uh just like some some first issues that came up . Um 'kay , so the method I was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . Um uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls , uh so mostly just by searching on the web and to see what um functionality they used . And then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what I found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And yeah , and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words . Um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , so this quite straightforward . And uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , uh then the user would like to switch the channel um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , so we would need the numbers . And and also the volume is very important . Um um I als okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Sorry , cou could you go back for a second ? Uh switching on off channel , uh volume , okay , that's great .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Um um among the findings I found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design , like operating a V_C_R_ , but they don't seem to be able to deal with D_V_D_ players , but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . So my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . And then it must be easy to use , so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button and maybe the colour tends to be red or something .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um then yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , and then volume has to be there . But then um other functionalities um could be just uh there could be a menu button and you could change things on the screen then , um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu . And yeah , the last question I had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , the answer was already no because of the last minute update . So at the for the time being that's uh that's all . If you have questions
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . If I mean that was the the directive that came through from management , but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and D_V_D_ , I could get back to them and see .
C :  It's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about .
D :  Yeah , and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different
D :  And there are so many different things that could possibly be included because besides video and D_V_D_ there are the mm um video C_D_s and whatever , so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay . Are there any questions for clarification of Maarika before we go on to the next one ?
A :  So in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . Um but um so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify or I mean in we can completely do away with buttons and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . But uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ?
D :  Um well , I think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use , I mean um what other options would you have ? A little screen or something , but this would be really kind of I think a lot of learning for the user and and I mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , not to spend time in like um giving several orders um I dunno . I think I th I would I would think the put the buttons , but if if you have other mm proposals um .
A :  Right .
A :  Yeah , and it'll make the costs yeah .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh I think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . So well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . Uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an L_C_D_ display and uh with um because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . So yeah ? Cool .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yep .
C :  Sure , we can discuss that maybe after the next one . Do you want to yeah .
B :  Cool . Do you wanna give me the little cable thing ?
D :  Uh am I going in the right direction ? No . Wait .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , here it comes .
C :  Oh , I'm getting hungry .
D :  Okay , here you are .
B :  Cool .
B :  Ah , that's why it won't meet . Okay , cool .
C :  You set ?
B :  Yep , cool . Okay , functional requirements .
C :  Uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here .
B :  Alright , yeah .
C :  Hello .
A :  try to press oh , okay , yep .
C :  Is it plugged in prop it's working ? Okay .
B :  It's working .
B :  Cool , okay . So
C :  Excellent .
B :  what I have , wh where I've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects and then they gave them a questionnaire . Um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . What's the most annoying things about remote controls and um the possibility of speech recognition and L_C_D_ screens in remote control . Not that they actually gave me any answers on the L_C_D_ screens , so I should have taken that bit out , but anyway .
B :  Um okay , so . What they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . Um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . Uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . Uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control . Um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , as you'll see on the next slide . Um I dunno what zapping is , but
C :  It's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through .
B :  Oh , right . But you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . Um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , they just make it look ugly . Okay ? Cool . Um so this is my little graph thing .
A :  Mm .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm .
C :  Ooh , that's a bit difficult to see .
B :  Mm k
C :  If you explain it to us it'll be fine .
B :  Okay , well , I can send it to all of you . What it is is um it's cones , 'cause I thought they'd be more exciting . Um but ooh where's it go ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  I liked the , I liked the litt ooh come back .
B :  Back .
B :  Oh .
C :  No .
B :  Oh yes , cool . Okay , I'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing . Um okay , so like what it shows is how much things are used relatively and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . What you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm , that's the next one along , yeah ?
B :  Yeah , so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know , so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , although I don't understand how it couldn't be , um and everything else , I think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , 'cause they're just not needed , and they're not used .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay . This is the bit that the email messed up for me and that's what I was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . Okay , cool . So um okay , so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . Uh that they get lost , that the uh you know , they're not intuitive and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . I think if you're watching enough T_V_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching T_V_ , then that's the least of your problems , but you know , it's up there . Um that yeah . Okay , so um I mean the the R_S_I_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control and you know , not straining your wrists watching T_V_ .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  The remote control .
A :  Mm .
A :  Right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes . Okay , cool . Right , um sorry this is pink because I was copying and pasting the table , and I didn't have time to white it out again . Um okay , but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . So you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it and they're less willing to to try it . Um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , but um you know I d I do wonder how well that would work given that a T_V_ , you know , tends to be people talking and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching T_V_ . Um okay ?
A :  Hmm .
C :  That's alright .
C :  Mm .
A :  Right .
B :  Cool . Um okay , so these are my personal preferences . So you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , so something that's , you know , a bit cool . Um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . Um there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? You know , so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , so I think we need to aim for both . Um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier and um , you know , I was thinking that solar power would be quite cool because , you know , your remote control just sits there , and you could just sit it in the sunshine and save the environment a bit . Um and then like a locator , so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or not a mobile phone
A :  Mm . Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Some kind of a ring , some
C :  Keys and things like that , yeah . Whistle and it screams at you , yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's it , you know .
B :  I know , it's weird . My flatmate and I were talking about this on the way into uni this morning and I was like I need to get one for everything . So yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , something a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the T_V_ , you know , 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . So okay ? Cool . That's me .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right .
A :  Hmm .
C :  That's you , excellent .
A :  Okay , that's great , thanks .
D :  Um that's very good , very interesting .
C :  Um .
C :  I'm just gonna tick yes .
C :  So , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss
A :  Mm .
A :  I think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh Ka Kate Cat Cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . So if we need to have a target group um then uh I think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . Um .
B :  Cat's . Ca .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , I mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , but I'm assuming , you know , yes .
A :  Right .
A :  Right . Bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . Then again I guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket and the I don't know how often they're buying televisions .
A :  Right , and
A :  Right .
B :  Well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? So , you know
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , but you don't have much money , generally . I would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and
D :  Yeah . Yeah , you share a television or something that yeah .
A :  Right . But uh still , if if you can go back to that slide and uh , how popular was it ? Oh , oh , okay . That's alright , if you can just look it up on your computer , wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . So even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  O oh it's on sorry , we unplugged it .
B :  Oh , I've unplugged it . Do you want me to
C :  Here , let me
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Seventy six point three percent .
D :  It was seventy something , yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , I kn I mean I know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , but I mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income because they don't have like I mean , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , but you don't have a mortgage , you don't have a life insurance policy , you don't
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , they've got no commitments and
A :  Alright .
C :  usually not a car and all of those things .
B :  normally have a car , yeah , so . You're still learning to drive actually , so that just costs more than a car , but yeah . Um so I mean like it is an age group to target , really , I think .
C :  Kids . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So you're more likely to b
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , and if we're if we're talking twenty five Euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people .
B :  No , I mean that's what , that's like fifteen Pounds ? You know , I think
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah this this is not unaffordable , but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a T_V_ to use its full
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I d I don't know many people without a T_V_ . We didn't have a T_V_ last year , and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But do they
C :  But the T_V_s are often kind of someone's old T_V_ that's blah blah and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote .
D :  Common , the students yeah , yeah . The s the stu yeah , and the remote control might not yeah , it might not even function with the old T_V_ .
A :  Mm .
A :  Bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? So mm uh are are are
B :  Yeah , I d well we've we've got quite a d decent T_V_ .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , we're still yeah . Or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think I think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , I would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . You know , so I mean that and the disposable income and I don't think it's something to ignore , you know .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but at the same time I think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , because actually I mean they're all still re young people . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Is not a massive difference , you know . No , do totally .
C :  Yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . Is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ?
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um I was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , but voice recognition itself I'm not very sure about , because one of the p uh things that Cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? Uh and uh
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  You do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? Because you have like I mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . But how frequently do we use it anyway and um uh h ho how good is it , you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I don't know .
C :  Yeah . With um but with a T_V_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five ,
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
C :  louder , tha that should be relatively simple .
B :  S so
A :  Right .
A :  Okay . O
B :  y you'd maybe need a code word . Do you know what I mean ? So like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on T_V_ , so maybe like , you know , remote . I mean how often do people say remote on T_V_ ? Although I only watch Charmed , so really I wouldn't know but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check . Um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group
C :  and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising .
D :  Yeah but uh um
D :  Yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls .
D :  Yeah , w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , but I think this is not really the right moment yet , because people are just so used to buttons and um , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , so the voice recognition would be just an extra , it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote .
C :  Yeah , I think we need both .
A :  Mm . W
A :  What uh
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
A :  What wh uh what I was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on T_V_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . If we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular uh in the sense that uh a person can say , I want to watch uh I_T_V_ one instead of saying that I want to go onto channel number forty five . Yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , some kind of
C :  Uh-huh . Uh-huh .
B :  Yeah , that would be another way to do it .
C :  So that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great .
B :  Yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , because I mean Sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , so then it would be you'd be watching Charmed , and then the Sky advert would come on and it would change to Sky .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Watch Sky and yeah .
A :  Alright .
B :  Yeah , yeah , and that would be really annoying .
A :  Yeah , that's
A :  Right .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But that's definitely a possibility .
D :  Yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it and and the T_V_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ?
C :  So that you can yell at it , yeah .
B :  Yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . It's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
D :  Yeah , but then the remote control I think I mean um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , because then you could already yell at the television and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself .
B :  Yeah , yeah , I suppose nearer to you but a b like if you have surround sound then
A :  Mm yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control being cl I mean it'll it'll mm .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  No , but I I I was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . So uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the T_V_ , so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , so we we can probably come to know where it is .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That's but then if you're buying the remote separately , but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the T_V_ or something , some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the T_V_ .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah , yeah .
A :  Right , yeah , yeah , yeah .
D :  Okay , yeah , mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control .
C :  The l
A :  Alright , yeah .
C :  Well that's right , but it solves the problem of having different noises .
B :  Yeah , definitely , yeah .
C :  Yeah . Okay , I think we're gonna have to wrap this up um .
C :  But if we go away with that that kind of general
C :  um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um .
D :  The major ones , yeah .
A :  Right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  What we have to do now is to go back to our little places , complete our questionnaire and some sort of summarisation , which y you'll get immediately by email . Send me your presentations so that I can use them to make the minutes , and then we've got a lunch break and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . Um I'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , but I'll send you an email when I do it , so that you know . It should be on your desktop , so on the yeah . So I'll put it I'll put them there as soon as I've written them .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So where exactly is this i
A :  Ah , okay . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Did you find it ? It's just yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah , yeah in that one , right yeah .
C :  Yeah , and email them round .
B :  Oh , so y you want our um PowerPoint presentations in there , hey ?
C :  Yeah , that would be great .
B :  Okay .
D :  Oh so so we'll just put them i there , we we yeah , w we won't even okay .
C :  Oh yeah , put them in there . Yeah , then you don't have to email them .
B :  There you go .
B :  But is everyone's called functional requirements ?
C :  No , they're all called something slightly different . Technical requirements and something something , yeah . So , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to .
A :  No .
B :  Okay , so that's good . That's me done .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , cool .
C :  Um as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . Yeah ? Whatever that means .
A :  Right .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I guess I'll find out .
C :  You'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , on something conceptual and you're watching trends to see how we go and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ?
D :  Uh something conceptual , yeah .
A :  Wha what was it again that I was supposed to look into ? Con components , oh .
C :  Components , yeah .
D :  Hmm . Sorry , but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch or shall we prepare our
C :  No , we have we have after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , so that's fine , w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary .
D :  To prepare , okay , yeah , that's good .
D :  Okay .
C :  Okay ? Right on time . Okay , so you can I guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ?
D :  Cool .
D :  Okay , see you .
A :  Think we can first
B :  Mm .
C :  Right it was function F_ eight or something .
C :  This one right there .
B :  Okay . Who is gonna do a PowerPoint presentation ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Think we all
C :  Huh .
B :  You will as well ?
C :  Oh I thought we all were . Yeah , I have one too , okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  .
B :  Yep .
D :  .
C :  Whoops I forgot to put the thing on
A :  Right . I just wanna 'cause basically I can't re I've really crap at remembering everyone's name so I just wanna rather than going uh Miss Marketing and Miss this and Miss that wanted to know your names again . just gonna leave this up here 'cause I'll you know . So
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay I'm
C :  Yeah . Sure , that's a good idea .
B :  Okay .
B :  I'm Catherine with a C_ . C_A_T_H_
B :  I_N_E_ .
A :  Okay , and Gabriel .
C :  Uh Gabriel .
A :  E_L_ is it ?
C :  E_L_ .
A :  'Kay .
A :  And you're s r R_E_I_S_S_
D :  I am Reissa . R_E_I_S_S_A_ .
D :  Double S_ A_ , yeah yeah . Sorry .
A :  Okay .
A :  'S just a bit nicer calling people by their names I think . Uh , right .
B :  Right .
B :  True .
D :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Okay , right , welcome to meeting B_ . Um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , uh 'cause I know what I'm supposed to be doing now . I am your Project Manager , and , uh yeah , I'm just here to
A :  sort of liaise between the three of you and get things going , get people talking and and I'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . Um right , this for the purposes of this meeting what this meeting is all about is um I'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , what you've been working on for the last
A :  wee while , when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . But hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive . So we're gonna each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . Um .
D :  Mm .
A :  Then we're gonna work , you know , from each of your presentations . We'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . Um and then we'll , yeah , we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it .
B :  How long is the meeting ?
A :  This meeting it's not very long . It's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . So I want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . Um if you haven't done a PowerPoint thingy , it doesn't matter , it it just it just says that you it's that's just one particular medium . If you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , you can talk to us , you can you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can .
B :  Okay .
B :  No problem .
A :  Don't feel pressurised into using this thing . 'Cause I don't . Uh okay . So um . You okay over there ? Reissa , are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some Internet shopping there ?
D :  I'm fine . Yeah .
D :  I uh yeah , yeah . D I mean , I I'm finishing off my presentation .
C :  Think she's finishing up her presentation .
D :  No no .
D :  Uh I'm done . Okay .
A :  Okay , jolly good . Alright , let's have um well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . I think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . So that's gonna be you Catherine , if we wanna hear from you first .
D :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Um just connecting this .
B :  Are we getting i
A :  You don't have to worry about screwing it in just there you go .
B :  Really ? Okay . Cool . Okay . So I've got a very quick uh
B :  Uh .
B :  Okay .
B :  So the working design , I've got a very quick presentation on this , so um I've oh no , you can't see a thing . Oh well , I'm gonna draw it on the board then . It's in blue uh , and I couldn't change it . We it's fine on my screen , but never mind . So um the idea is that we've got the
C :  Oh .
A :  Ah .
B :  energy source um , which in our case will pr , oh well okay , never mind . So um I think maybe uh two batteries , I dunno what they're called six , or something like that . Uh and then
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  um
B :  then on the uh remote control itself will have um the sender for the signal , which could be uh
B :  an infra-red signal ,
B :  um which will be sent by an electronic chip .
B :  And uh the chip will be controlled by the user interface .
B :  So we'll hear about that later from Gabriel . And uh the sender will send to the telly itself an infra-red signal to tell it to switch on or switch channels .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um and that's it really for the working design .
A :  Great . Okay .
B :  Sorry the presentation wasn't very uh clear but
A :  I prefer the pe I prefer the human touch personally . Yeah .
B :  Really ? Cool .
B :  Um , should I erase this or
A :  Do you wanna just give us a moment , I just wanna copy this down . Um I dunno if you guys have got any questions for Catherine on any of this ?
B :  Okay .
B :  Fine .
B :  Or suggestions ?
D :  Is a battery like
D :  the only way of
B :  Well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s
C :  Yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or
B :  In indoors .
A :  Yeah , you blow on it and i
D :  No , no
D :  No I meant like
C :  Bicycle power .
D :  No 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . The battery's down and maybe , I dunno , solar charged ?
B :  I dunno , swi I th I th I think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but
A :  Yeah , it's worked for the last fifty years you know .
D :  Mm . Yeah .
C :  One question I have , and I don't know how much control we have over this is um , as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the T_V_ , and still have it be operational ? I mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream .
A :  How far away is your television ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  It's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a T_V_ the size of a football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far , does it ? Doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall .
C :  Uh
B :  Well , the thing is uh you you don't
D :  Yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room .
C :  That's true .
B :  Well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it .
B :  I didn't think about that
D :  How about Bluetooth ?
B :  but
D :  Instead of using infra-red ,
D :  use Bluetooth .
B :  Why not ?
D :  Isn't that a better signal ?
B :  I just think that it's it's gonna cost more and I'm I'm not sure it's you're gonna use it .
A :  Yeah , yeah I d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . You know we don't need it .
D :  Mm .
B :  It's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , but then I don't th I dunno , either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , you are gonna
A :  Yeah , exactly . Basically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . We're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . It's uh
B :  But
D :  Mm .
B :  Oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i
B :  We can see at a later stage , maybe , I don't
D :  'S just an idea .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right , well done , Catherine . Um Gab Gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things .
C :  Okay .
B :  Do you need the border ?
C :  Uh I'm just gonna use the PowerPoint uh .
B :  Okay .
B :  Sorry .
C :  Technical . Okay .
D :  Adjusting .
C :  Okay , so , while this is warming up , there it is uh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So I'm doing the user interface design .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , I was I was looking looking at
C :  looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there .
C :  Thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , I guess , I mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that ,
C :  the basic functionality that people want .
C :  Um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control ,
C :  um so up-down keys for that , uh channel keys up-down , but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , and uh a mute button . Uh one thing that I didn't include here , that I forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function . Uh , I don't I dunno , uh that's one possibility .
A :  Okay .
C :  And so in the research that I was doing
C :  there's basically two types of remotes , ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , which I don't know if I can access the web page from here , but I can show you uh .
C :  Yeah . So this is a engineer centred one , so you see it's rather busy , but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame . Uh and this is a user centred one . Uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do , you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . And I judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting I kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , uh or the direction we were going in at least . Um .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Great .
C :  So , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , but it can be a little bit overwhelming , so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . Uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , Reissa , because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . So uh , yeah , that's me .
D :  Mm .
D :  .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Great . Okay . Now that's I just have a q a q question for you . This w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units stuff . Um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or
C :  No that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as I know . I mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones . That was sort of the inspiration for it . Um I've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I've , haven't I've never seen a locking functionality .
C :  I dunno , what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ?
A :  Um
A :  I would say
A :  it's
A :  If it's simple to do ,
A :  which I think it probably should be , even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , it's like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , but you know being physical . Look into . Um I've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . It's gotta d look like it's in the R_ and R_ .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  'Kay .
C :  Right .
C :  Mm .
A :  You know , the the company it's it's , from what I can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . Um .
D :  Mm .
C :  Right .
C :  And our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics .
A :  We put the fashion in electronics . There you go .
D :  Mm .
C :  I think I think we have to carry that mental .
A :  So it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . If if remote control well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be .
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
C :  Well yeah these , I think , we can so we talked about the layout in my presentation and what I didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . I t I think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , I mean .
A :  Yeah . Because we need
A :  Yeah . Great .
C :  Uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic and keyboards and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , I guess . Um .
A :  Okay , fantastic . Right , well done , Gabriel . Um Reissa . Let's plug you in , baby .
D :  Okay .
D :  .
D :  Where does it go into ?
C :  .
D :  Here ? The blue thing .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , yeah , this is getting all . Mm .
D :  .
C :  Yeah , then you just have to do function F_ eight and it should come up .
D :  Well , function F_ eight .
D :  No oh .
C :  Yeah , it just takes a second uh .
A :  Yeah , w it it just takes a wee while .
D :  Come on .
D :  Right . Okay . . Okay . Well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , and also gave so this is research and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . Um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . So seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . Okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . Um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . So I think we all agree with that . Um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user .
D :  So , they don't like like the way they operate it doesn't
D :  like match how people behave . Um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , they only use the up and down channel .
A :  'Cause we've only got five channels .
D :  exactly . That's another thing . Um seventy five per cent of users say they zap .
D :  Not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like .
A :  I think that's k flicking quickly between channels .
C :  Yeah , you wanna navigate the channels quickly I guess .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm . Um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . I think especially for uh the older generation . I know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , takes ages to work how to use . Anyway um and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . So maybe tracking devices is a good idea . Um personal preferences .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Wow . You are a child of technology , aren't you ?
D :  Um so yeah um I was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . Um has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . And it's easy to find , so I don't know whether maybe and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating .
D :  So voice activation . So and this was what we came up with . Then if you look fifteen to twenty five this is age , sorry , age groups . So fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes . Um so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . And neither did the older generation , but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote .
A :  So there you go , yeah .
A :  Uh but do the younger generation have the money ? They they don't . It's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and
C :  No I would I would say the older the older people , yeah .
D :  Well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so
A :  People people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . For people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it .
A :  Um but no they're not sort of most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years . Um d and tha and that's a that's quite a minority there , so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent .
C :  Yeah , that would be my guess as well .
D :  So they don't
D :  Well
D :  These guys are growing up .
C :  What about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? I mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit . I mean , okay , there's
A :  Yeah .
D :  Voice activation might not be the best .
A :  I would say scra I'd say scrap that straight off .
C :  Uh .
D :  Um also with um with buttons , a thing called R_S_I_ , so wrist sense Huh ?
C :  Repetitive strain uh rep repetitive strain injury or like from doing
D :  Yeah , repetitive strains injury , so they don't I think people who watch T_V_ maybe too often , keep changing channel hurts their wrist . I don't think so .
B :  Well maybe they shouldn't watch so much T_V_ then .
A :  So y so it's so it's so you got so that's something we should have a look into then i when desi when designing the ergonomics of see have a look if um there's any w any medical background we can find out about this .
D :  Yeah maybe not so hard .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
B :  Maybe it could be , instead of pressing button it could be just touching a
D :  Yeah .
A :  Let's jus we just want need to cover our arses so that people aren't gonna sue us in ten years' time , say your remote control gave me repetitive strain injury .
D :  Maybe
C :  Yeah , we should probably consult with our legal department uh .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . They're having a lunch break at the moment , but yeah . I'll see if I can get see if I can get hold of them for the next meeting .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I think we can do some really in in that department , the the ergonomic department , we can make some some really good improvements .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm . Maybe th the buttons not so high up so you don't have to press so much , or we just like flat buttons , something .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . That's great , thank you very much for that , Reissa . Um okay , so we've basically
D :  So that is me .
A :  we've decide we've d
A :  we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . It's gotta be safe to use , it's gotta look cool . It's gotta be cheap . S um .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Now going back to the uh industrial design of it , you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or Bluetooth . I think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , uh and that would be infra-red , energy source , that would be batteries . Uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . Um .
A :  But a in there's no I don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . So
B :  Yep .
A :  I think we're all um pretty sussed on that .
A :  anyone have any questions ? Everybody happy in their work ?
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page .
A :  Now this is good , we've got a good structure going on . We all know where we're going to . Have you been ge has have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ?
C :  Oh it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager .
B :  .
D :  Well , just questionnaires .
C :  Sell trying to sell your things .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , stuff . Um okay . Do oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ?
D :  Yeah , you can .
A :  Right . Do all you all know my e-mail address ?
C :  Okay .
C :  No I don't . I
D :  I think he's participant one , aren't you ?
B :  Well , in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , I think . So Project Manager , it's participant one at A_M_I_ .
C :  Uh
C :  Oh , it's just participant one oh okay . Yeah .
A :  Can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ?
C :  Well it's just w it's just it's just par participant one , participant two .
B :  You have them i you have them , but we'll send you an e-mail . You want to have friends , don't you ?
A :  .
A :  Send me , yeah yeah , okay .
C :  So are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that .
A :  Is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? I I kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , but I might be just going a bit
C :  Well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . Maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves .
A :  Okay . Well ,
B :  It wouldn't be
A :  maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas ?
C :  Mm .
D :  Can't we have different colours in the remotes , so somebody can choose different col like does it have to be of a certain ?
C :  Mm .
A :  Well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . It's gotta say people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a Real Reaction i product .
D :  But if it's a R_R_ , it would be Real Reaction , like if it had a symbol on it .
C :  Mm .
A :  There's loads of companies that called R_R_ .
C :  Mm .
D :  Whoa .
A :  This is slog but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type .
C :  And this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , so , I mean , we are sort of beholden to them .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So we have to have it one colour .
A :  Well , not necessarily . But we have to incorporate it .
C :  Not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable .
D :  Mm .
A :  Not necessarily even if i it just has to ye but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products as opposed to a Sony product or a , you know , a Panasonic product . It's got to so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps .
B :  Well you could
D :  Mm .
B :  It could come
B :  But it could come in different colours and have the R_R_ colours just somewhere like just around the lock button could be the R_R_ logo or colours and
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  If .
A :  Quite poss yeah . Well this is all your department .
A :  Mm okay . Well , well done everybody . And um , I think we uh stop for lunch now .
C :  .
C :  Yeah , pretty soon I think , I guess that's now .
D :  Are we are we finished ahead of schedule ?
A :  We might possibly have done .
B :  Cool .
C :  Alright , see you all soon .
A :  If we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch .
D :  'Kay uh .
A :  Yeah , there you go .
A :  Right . I just have to there's a few little bits and pieces I have to write down , but
A :  Take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em .
A :  Good to see you all again . Let's see if that comes up .
A :  This is our functional design meeting .
A :  Um .
A :  Just a sec while my PowerPoint comes up .
A :  Et voila .
A :  Okay . Mm um we put the fashion in electronics .
A :  Let's start . Okay , our agenda today um just check the time , it's twelve thirteen .
A :  Um .
A :  I'm gonna do an opening , talk about um did you all get the minutes ? I e-mailed them to you . I'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder . So um then I we'll talk about our general objectives and have your three presentations . Um I'll talk about the new project requirements I've just received , and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions . Finally we'll just close . We're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen and we have forty minutes . So
C :  Yep .
B :  Right .
A :  First of all the functional design objectives . Uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function .
A :  Okay , three presentations , um you can go in any order you choose um .
D :  Mm shall we go in the order that you just did it ?
A :  Sure , please do .
D :  I dunno .
D :  How do I hook my screen up ?
B :  I think , you might have to disconnect Rose .
A :  Yes I do .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there
D :  Where does it go ? Mm-hmm .
D :  Hmm , I'm not supposed to move this , but
C :  Ah that's it , yep .
C :  And then you have to press function F_ eight I think it is on your laptop .
A :  Function , F_ eight , yeah .
D :  Where's function ?
A :  The blue one , F_N_ .
D :  No signal .
A :  Is it plugged in all the way and you screwed it in and
D :  Ah , wait , 's screw in .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I I think you just have to push it in really hard .
D :  Push the screw .
C :  That's it .
B :  Oh , got it .
A :  Mm 'kay . It's taking it a little bit
D :  Mm alright
D :  I've never attached to anything .
B :  Mm , neither have I .
A :  'Kay there you go .
D :  Alright , so , I don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online or if I'm the only one who is .
B :  Alright .
D :  But , I don't even know how to play this .
D :  No .
A :  Press the little presentation . It's the um it looks like a Y_ kind of over there above Draw .
A :  There , that one , there you go .
D :  Alright . So we're just gonna talk a little bit about the functional requirements that people specified when they were asked . Um I guess Real Reaction did some market research . They had a hundred subjects and their usability lab and they watched them watch T_V_ and recorded the frequency that they used particular buttons and the relevance that those buttons had .
D :  What they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . Focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that and that they more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . I don't know anything beyond what fancy means , but that's particularly of use to us , I think . Um also they did some questions on voice recognition and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions .
B :  Hmm .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Um people also had certain frustrations , that I think that we could try to take into consideration with
D :  our design . That being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes . I think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . People are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote and I think that ties back to what you were saying before just that there's too many buttons , it just needs to be easy to use . It also mentioned something called R_S_I_ and I was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what R_S_I_ is , because I don't know .
B :  Hmm .
C :  Repetitive strain injury .
D :  What ?
C :  Repetitive strain injury .
D :  Ah . There we go . Wow . People do not like that . So I guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , um the repetitive use , I guess , caused a strain . Um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . People are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote .
C :  So if you
D :  And what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . People also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . So we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , because they're used much more infrequently and probably just complicate what's going on .
D :  So I think that some things that we might wanna think about , the idea of an L_C_D_ screen was brought up although they didn't have any details on
D :  what people's preferences on that were , so I dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . But something for us to consider also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote or what we wanna make easiest to use , make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . And basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , that it has a fancy appeal and that it's not ugly and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Thank you very much . That was that was great . Um 's move on to the next presentation um on effects . Was that you ? Great .
B :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , have I unscrewed it ?
A :  Push .
A :  User interface , right .
A :  Interface .
D :  Here we go .
C :  Cheers .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And I think that's in the shared , if I did it right , if anyone wants to look at it .
A :  Mm 'kay , thank you .
B :  Okay , great .
A :  Okay .
C :  Here we go .
C :  Right so I'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um .
C :  We need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . It's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , so i it's basically a communication device . We we tell the remote control what we want to do , it sends a message to the television saying change the channel , change the volume , uh yeah , adjust these settings , adjust the brightness .
C :  Um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ?
C :  First thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . We need to know what our final product is gonna be like , so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , uh how it works , and what the end-user is gonna want from this product .
C :  Um .
C :  Oh , a way I'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about
C :  h how well these particular prototypes work , uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . Um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . Um ,
A :  Hmm .
C :  and different different people sort of prefer different things .
C :  Um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . When a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . So in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design uh so that we're not completely shocking people . But I think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out .
C :  Um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . Uh the first of these is is technological ye uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . The second is is economic , uh we need to find a balance between features and price . So as you mentioned things like voice recognition would would add to the price uh but it would also im improve the design of the product .
A :  Hmm .
C :  So I had a look on the on the web uh to see if I could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . In analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them , uh what things do they get right , what's bad about them , what's wrong with 'em , um how we can improve on the designs that that that I found and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls .
C :  Here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . Um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , so it's one that's got lots of buttons , it's it's fully featured , everything you might possibly want to do is there , you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . Yeah , it's it's fully featured and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your T_V_ .
C :  The one on the right is a lot more basic . It's just got the essential functions of the T_V_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . It would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts . There are disadvantages , you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture . Uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . So we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two .
C :  Um as I said before , remote controls are subjective , different people want want different things . Um personally wa what I want from a remote control is a device that's simple , it it's easy to use , uh it's got big buttons for doing the things I do most often , changing the volume , changing the channel . It it does everything that I need it to uh , as I said before , I'm quite lazy , I don't wanna walk across the room just to adjust my television . I also want something that that looks cool , um and that that feels good , that's ergonomically designed .
A :  Mm 'kay . Thank you very much . That was very useful . It's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes . Um .
B :  Hmm .
A :  And neither of them were very pretty , you know ?
D :  No .
B :  Yeah . I think that could be our selling point .
A :  Mm .
D :  A fashion fashion remote .
C :  I think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool . And I think that's that's why companies like Apple've 've 've made a lot of progress .
B :  Right .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Hmm . Right , I really can't see what I'm doing , so does anyone have a
D :  Yeah .
A :  You there it is .
B :  Ah-ha , look at that , showing up already .
A :  Lovely .
D :  So wait , did it let you go on the Internet or was that just what it let you see ?
C :  Uh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah .
D :  Okay . 'Cause I was like googling and then I'm like wait it won't let me google .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Alright um
B :  No , how do I play again ?
A :  Um the it's right above Draw . There are three thingy if it's way at the bottom . Under three icons and it's the one that looks like a desk . Yeah , that one . There are Y_s .
B :  Ah .
B :  Okay . So this is our working design presentation . Um I had a bit of some issues with this , because I wasn't able to find everything I needed , but I guess that's we're still in early stages . Um so , yeah , this is this . Though th the thing about working design is the what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function .
B :  Um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . It works because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans and then you put the bean through a filter and that filters out , and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . Don't know if I'm explaining that very well , but how do I get to the next s ah .
B :  So h the method as um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , what what needs to be done and how do we convert all the elements to make that done . So wha the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points
B :  at which you need something to happen . So you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted
B :  tsh towards this practical function . And then I think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately . So um
B :  Uh . Uh .
A :  You just press yeah , just click . That'll be fine .
B :  So the findings that I got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that 'cause you don't need a sight line . So that's one thing we're gonna work on . Um the user interface is critical here , because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , which then goes through the infra-red , so the the chip that uh I think Ian is designing , is gonna be crucial .
B :  And really it all comes down to the to the user , because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . So the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . So you have four main components and they are designed sort of like this . You have your energy source right there which then um brings
B :  uh energy or information to the chip , which is also controlled by the users . You have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip ooh 's not what I wanted to do uh uh .
A :  Um yeah use that thing you can go back , previous .
B :  Previous .
B :  Sorry about that , guys .
A :  Pardon .
B :  Oh .
A :  Oh , well . Okay .
B :  No , no , no , no , no . Okay , let's just get back to my schematic here .
A :  Double click on it .
A :  With the right with the left hand one .
B :  W yeah , yeah . I think it's frozen . Here . Don't show me that tip again . There we are . Sorry about this , guys . I'm kind of pathetic with things like this . Um alright . So you have your energy source , your user interface who's controlling the chip , the chip also uses the energy , and the chip through the use of the user interface is gonna control the switch which will work your infra-red bulb , which will then bring the data to the receiver . So hopefully that makes sense for everyone in my kind of garbled way . This is the the parts of the working design that need to be figured out . And personal preferences , besides the fact that I can't spell , we need a long-lasting energy source , people don't wanna be changing it a lot . We need a chip that works well with the user interface , that isn't too complicated .
A :  There we are .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We need a straightforward interface , like Ian was saying , simple , not overwhelming it with information and we need a reliable and clear infra-red signal , so that you're not waving your remote around and having to get frustrated and go do it by hands . So that's pretty much it for the working design .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Excellent .
A :  So , um .
B :  Rose , do you think you can give me a hand with this ?
A :  Yes , absolutely .
A :  Ah I can never tell which way to turn these things .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Lefty loosey , righty tighty , right ? Lefty loosey , righty tighty .
B :  Yeah .
C :  What's up ?
C :  Lefty loosey .
C :  Uh . Never heard that before , that's good .
A :  Oh yes .
C :  I'll think of that every time now .
B :  It's gonna stick in your head .
D :  Yeah , that's a good one it'll stick with you .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Um I have nothing on my screen .
A :  Just a sec .
B :  Mm .
A :  Here we are .
B :  Ooh , no signal .
A :  Okay , yeah , it's fine .
A :  Okay , requirements . We have a couple new requirements that I was just e-mailed right before the meeting and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this . We didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , but we're not gonna work with teletext because um well it that's been taken over by the internet , so we're not gonna worry about um we're not gonna worry about that .
B :  Okay .
D :  What's teletext ?
B :  Uh , it's a British thing .
A :  Um .
D :  Oh . Oh , so
C :  You don't have it in the States ?
B :  No .
A :  It no . W d could would you care to explain it ?
C :  Oh , I didn't realise . Um yeah , it's like a
C :  I suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser . Um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control , uh y and you type in the page number you want , so like you type a hundred on your remote control and this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . And you just type numbers to go to different pages and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on T_V_ next and share prices and that kind of thing .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Lottery numbers and sport scores .
C :  Yep , news headlines .
B :  But if you ever see the T_V_ saying like go to page one sixty on Ceefax now , that's what they're talking about .
A :  How ?
D :  Oh .
C :  It's earl it's pretty old technology . It's like nineteen eighties .
A :  Okay .
D :  That explains a lot .
B :  I have no idea why we don't have it , but
D :  That's good .
A :  Interesting . Okay um , well , we're not gonna the management has decided we're not gonna work with that . Um
A :  Okay um and we're also gonna w like your question earlier um whether this is going to be t for television , video , or etcetera . Just for television . That's what we're focused on . Um otherwise becomes to complex , we wanna get this out um very quickly . We only have a a short amount of time .
C :  Right .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Um and finally there's more marketing , I think , um , our corporate image has to be recognisable . So while we're gonna make it look pretty we need to use our colour and our slogan i in the new design .
B :  Mm .
C :  So what's our corporate image like ? It's It's kind of yellow colour with uh we put fashion in electronics .
A :  Looks like , yeah , kind of a yellow and black and we have that the emphasis on the R_s in um mm-hmm .
C :  It's like double R_ .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But it's , yeah , we put the um
A :  fashion in electronics . So we gotta keep that in that in mind .
B :  Okay , so we want something that looks good
A :  Yep . Yep .
B :  and is yellow .
A :  Yeah , or ha maybe some buttons could be yellow . Like , we can we can play around with it a little bit .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um .
A :  Okay , we need to talk about our functions and our target group . We need to decide who our target group is . You um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things or had certain preferences , for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition , but younger people did . Um and so who are we aiming this at ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically , I think , a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this .
D :  Yes , I do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ?
A :  Mm-hmm . It's gonna be twenty five Euro remember , so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television or is it something that comes w with a television ? 'Cause that would affect the way that we market it .
A :  Well at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself , so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five Euro by itself .
C :  Right .
C :  Right , okay .
D :  The only break-down that I was given in terms of age was the voice activation and basically there's a big jump , after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea . I dunno I'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , so that might be a fairly good target group for us .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Now , those are that's all specific for speech recognition . Are we gonna use that as one of our functions ?
C :  Um .
B :  Mm .
C :  I I would say no , because it's gonna add too much to the price .
C :  Especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying uh , well , uh we've got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half Euros for to produce it ? And I wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half Euros without having to make too many other compromises .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  To produce it , yeah .
A :  To produce it , yes .
A :  Mm .
D :  But what else are we gonna put , I mean not that I'm really gung-ho about it , I don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though . So like other than just making it look good , how is it I mean it can look really great and still have the same up-n-down buttons and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
B :  But right .
B :  Well but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? Everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology , in fact it could use it could mean , not . If they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  That's a good thing to keep in mind .
D :  If someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ? I dunno .
A :  Upgrade ? Well , we can look for we can look at upgrade or we can look at um user-friendly .
B :  Yeah , simplification . They could have a crap remote that came with their T_V_ that's just impossible to use , or maybe it broke , or maybe they're just missing it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Simplification , so
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh-huh , mm .
A :  And we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones or also have the other ones just separate somehow or
D :  Can you like I mean this may be too complicated , but , I wish I had something to explain it , like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , that had like the main buttons and then you could like pull something out , kind of and like you got the rest the buttons , but the rest of them like went in . Do you know what I'm saying ?
B :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Ooh .
C :  The remote There are remote controls like that , yeah . Like some T_V_s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it that hides all the complicated buttons . So if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down and there's all the all the special buttons .
A :  Kind of pull out of the side .
A :  Mm .
B :  Ooh .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  'Cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out . And you're a happy person and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes , one that has the easy ones and one that has
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , that's a good idea .
D :  more complicated ones , but 's all still in one .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I think that's a good idea , yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Um we have to be careful that that that doesn't impede um the chip transmitting information , but um that's gonna be mostly technological thing . Um .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Good point . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay um , so what are we emphasising ?
A :  I what in this project ?
C :  Si simplicity and fashion .
D :  I think simplicity , fashion .
A :  Simplicity and fashion .
B :  Yeah mm .
A :  Okay , those are very good goals , I think , um that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do . Simplicity and fashion and , yeah , or usability speci however you wanna say that , which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , so that you don't have to travel around a lot .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
D :  What can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , like why would it not be ? I'm just wondering .
A :  I think it's a lot to do with battery , but that's just my
D :  Okay .
B :  The battery and that I think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So 's just the quality of the chip .
B :  Yeah . I think so .
D :  Okay .
B :  The quality uh quality of all the components really , I mean , we can't really do anything shoddy work , 'cause it's
C :  Yeah .
B :  gonna be visible down the line .
A :  So our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ?
D :  Well , I dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing
A :  S voice recognition , which I kind of I kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control , like it might be necessary for a T_V_ but not for the remote c , you know . Seems a little bit
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . I don't .
C :  It's , yeah , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech .
B :  Mm-mm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah , and it might be too expensive .
D :  And if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , like you know what I mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote you'd just talk to your T_V_ .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  It's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote .
B :  Ooh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm yeah . Maybe I mean if I get m more numbers , I'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . But this doesn't divide up anything and there was only a hundred subjects also , which isn't , I mean , really isn't that representative , especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , so
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , but I th I think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something .
A :  Under sixty five , okay , that's a good start . Um .
C :  Yep .
A :  I'd say we're uh can we narrow it down to maybe um
A :  teenagers and families ?
A :  'Cause that would go up to like fifty ?
B :  Or like single professionals or something .
D :  Twenty to like fifty five .
A :  Okay , single
D :  I dunno .
B :  Yeah .
A :  It's it's hard to narrow it down .
B :  It's really hard to figure out right now .
C :  I think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . I mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , and that might be older people , but then we've also got fashion , which is something that definitely appeals to younger people .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , maybe we can define it by like the demographic of
A :  Right .
D :  like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that , like , well obviously it has to be someone who owns a television , and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing .
C :  Yeah . Yeah aim for a an income group .
B :  That's a good point .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  So maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is because , yeah , things so different will appeal to different people , but
B :  Yeah , t probably .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Um oh , there're a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ?
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Like a button on a T_V_ you can press and it'll ring or something , I don't know like or beep ?
D :  I mean , like I said before , fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one and half the people said that happened and we all mentioned it before we knew about it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in . It would be relevant to like the overall goal I think , so
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , that'll probably be good .
A :  Okay , we have to we have about four minutes left to define our functions . So let's do that quickly . Um so we want something to keep it from getting lost .
C :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And we want
A :  we want large buttons for the essential things .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Large , accessible buttons for the essentials .
A :  We want a possibility to um to get um
A :  a possibility to get the extra functions .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Which are kind of hidden away in some way or
C :  well not hidden but they're uh
C :  they're not as prominent as the main features .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Um , yeah , hidden way .
A :  And we also want it to be fashionable , which I'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah
D :  on your coffee table , it's not like an eye sore , that kind of thing .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Alright .
A :  Okay , do it . Any other essential functions that we need ?
A :  Battery ? Do we need a long-life battery ?
B :  Battery battery use . Yeah , but I think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really .
D :  Yeah .
A :  But we might as well .
D :  So you never have to change the battery .
B :  Yeah .
C :  We should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all .
C :  I suspect the remote control does need a battery , but
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I would imagine . Just 'cause it is an electronic device , the
C :  I dunno if you can
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . It I think it does . I don't I don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one . But you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your iPod .
C :  Yeah , without the energy , yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's that's possible . Yeah .
B :  You could we could maybe do that instead . So you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery .
A :  Charging .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I dunno , that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
A :  We have to think about um space in living-rooms , too , like 'cause they're I mean , would you put it on top of the T_V_ ? I don't know , just think okay , that's that's a good idea , we'll keep it . Think it's
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah . That's just off the top of my head .
A :  And maybe fun .
A :  Okay . Um 'kay we're gonna conclude now , has everyone said their functions and 'kay .
C :  Yep .
A :  Um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary . I don't know what summarisation . Um and then we'll have our lunch break . After that we have thirty minutes of individual work . Um I'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these PowerPoint slides . If everyone could do that as well , that'd be great .
A :  Um you each have individual actions , I_ um I_D_ Industrial Design you've your components concept , User Interface , the user interface concept , market trend wa watching . And as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you . And hopefully , I hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site that they they seem to tell you that you could .
B :  Yeah , who knows .
A :  It's kinda frustrating , but um
A :  Be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary .
A :  Mm 'kay ?
B :  Sounds good .
A :  Great seeing y'all .
A : 
D :  It's good .
D :  Did you um were you able to like put yours in the group folder ? Okay .
B :  Yes , I just did that . Hopefully it is there for people . Yeah ?
D :  Yep .
A :  Looks like there are um looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's that I didn't do , it's from like an earlier project , I think so um
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Where is that ? Yours is
A :  Under the shared folder , I don't know it might not even be under yours as well . Projects .
B :  Technical . So in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements . At least that's what I have in .
D :  I only have three , I just have like our three . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's what I have as well , R Rose So .
A :  Okay . You don't have mine ?
D :  No , but that's 'cause I think yours is in the e-mail separate , like it's not on the server .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  But if I open it and then save it , probably will be there . Oh wait , never mind you can't save it to the
A :  Okay . Well I'll figure that out in the meantime .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  All set ?
A :  Okay . Cool . Right . So um basically I'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news I've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control . And then I'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found and then we'll have a bit of discussion .
A :  So basically uh what I've just found out from the board I dunno if you guys got this email as well but it needs to be television only . So no we're not doing D_V_D_ , we're not doing anything else , it's just gonna be a television remote . Um it also needs to have the company colours included in it . Um so that's red and black . And it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um and no teletext . I'm not sure what teletext is but I'm assuming you guys do , so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design .
A :  For reasons that I don't really know . There's but it's the board so there you go . So basically um given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design we'll discuss it later I mean 'cause it's television only we'll be able to change our uh um
A :  well we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . Anyway . So I'm gonna turn over to the Industrial Designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation on
B :  Okay . So do I unplug this bit here ?
D :  Gotta plug you in .
A :  Oh , right yeah .
A :  Yep .
A :  Might have to hit function F_ eight but it looks like it's gonna come up .
A :  Yep . Cool .
B :  Okay . Right . That's page one of my presentation . So the uh method . We're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . Um remote control works as follows . This is all pretty basic stuff you guys . Um sends message to another system , so there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , there's an integrated circuit , which is the microchip , um and that actually compose the messages and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . A user interface controls the chip , basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well .
A :  Brilliant .
D :  Very nice . For your first PowerPoint it's lovely .
B :  So my findings , um I just did a preliminary study here and uh I found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . And too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . Um too much metal is used sometimes and people pick up radio signals and the like , and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire and injuring the customer , just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . Therefore I suggest primarily plastic construction .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Um , components . Just some ideas that I had , um , energy source , it's kinda hip to be eco friendly so I thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . Um the user interface , I was since we can't use metal I was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . The chip , um , silicon based chip I don't really see any way around that , we can't really be different in that respect . Um , the sender well I'm thinking infrared 'cause it is the industry standard , multi channel , that's a word I made up , I don't really know what it means . Uh PAL and N_T_S_C_ compatible and uh probably a two hundred foot range . Uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . Um but in this case it'll only be T_V_s . Um personal preferences , I really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , 'cause we were thinking
A :  Mm .
A :  'Kay . Fair enough .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Fine .
A :  Is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value um like if a white like if we talk about like well like on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ?
D :  It needs , yeah .
B :  Right .
B :  Yeah that shouldn't be a problem . Um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do .
A :  Okay , okay .
B :  That's the end of my presentation .
D :  Cool .
A :  Great .
A :  Thank you very much Nathan . Um if next we can have the um User Interface Developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .
A :  S plug yourself in here .
A :  Mm .
A :  Um hit function F_ eight real quickly , hold down
A :  Mm .
D :  Looks like you're in okay .
B :  Is it plugged in well ?
B :  There it goes . Computer adjusting .
D :  There you go .
A :  There you go . Sweet .
C :  Well so . Here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . Um so a few of the requirements we need here . Uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , it needs to be universal um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem . Um so some of my findings . Um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . Um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , I think we're all quite uh
A :  Yeah sorry I couldn't get that g to use before .
C :  quite uh intelligent and know know what a normal remote control does . Um now some of the other things I found is a a complicated remote control sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well but uh this remote control has many functions um so it can do a lot of things but it uh it is quite complicated and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions because they don't know how to use them and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it .
A :  Oh yeah look at that .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  As you also notice it's quite a boring design . Um . Another remote control , slightly different , it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . Um it also has a bit of a cheap look and it's also quite boring .
C :  So my personal preferences . Revolutionise the idea of uh a remote control . Um so attain the functionality of a complicated device but use a simple formatted display uh for the user to to work with . And I was gonna add another uh slide here but I didn't quite have time there . Um . Just incorporating some of the ideas that we had previously like uh having multiple face but it's uh .
A :  Nice .
A :  Okay .
A :  Great . Thanks for that Ron .
D :  Right .
A :  'Kay yep that's you .
D :  Does that mean I'm up ? I think so . Okay . Oh that would be perfect . Thank you .
C :  I can plug you in .
D :  Slide show up and running .
D :  Or not . Uh .
A :  Give it a little bit .
D :  Oh there we go . Perfect .
D :  Okay . So this is me . Um basically I was looking through some marketing reports that we've got and we had a usability test where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use T_V_ remotes and see what it is that they're using and then they filled out a questionnaire about what they like and what they don't about their general T_V_ remote control practices . Um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , m the majority of the time that's all that's going on , the other functions happen , for some people they're important , but the primary uses are really really basic . Um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , they're not using a lot of it , they don't need it , they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with .
D :  And um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . And then they can't find it in the room . So I think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . Um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . I don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , that's up to the design people , but it is s something worth thinking about , especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . Um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are
D :  the standards . So it's a good start for us .
A :  That's great . Thank you Sarah . Right . So um yep I'll just uh switch that back here . I'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase .
D :  Need to unplug this ?
D :  Need it back .
D :  There you go .
A :  Right so I think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations um we've got uh y the Industrial Designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . Um Sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , um so do we wanna go for that , or do we want to go for an older demographic , and my thought is um we've got w if we're gonna go for a sleek look I mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um .
D :  Oh right .
D :  We're not catering to the pensioners of the world I don't think so .
A :  Yes . So maybe this we should look into this younger demographic . Um . So
D :  Right .
A :  uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster um think we're constrained to plastics very well , we've got this idea , Ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um , which might be easier given that we're going for simpler function and that we're only going for a telly .
D :  Right .
D :  Uh .
A :  Um so um .
A :  How th this voice operation thing is I think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see . Okay you can't say record alias tonight at seven P_M_ but we might be able to say um volume up .
D :  Right .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Right . I think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology .
A :  Mm .
D :  Oh . That could work . I like that .
B :  With a simple command like locate . And then it could start to beep and
D :  Yeah . Something very basic .
D :  Right .
A :  Right .
B :  therefore be found .
C :  Sounds good .
D :  Is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ?
B :  Oh yeah I think that's very doable .
D :  Okay .
A :  The difficulty wh would be in um I think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . 'Kay you have something that picks up
B :  Mm .
A :  a voice from far away
D :  Yeah .
B :  It's a good point .
A :  If it's hidden under the couch but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too .
C :  A little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . And you just say something to into that and it
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  finds your
D :  K
A :  Or an isolated magnet or something like , or you know something that wouldn't interfere I don't know that'd be the technical thing but yeah I like that , I like that , the voice recognition for the paging system .
D :  Yeah .
C :  The other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . So it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . And the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method and the older market might might k exactly and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not .
D :  True .
D :  Making it just an option ? Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Right .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I was thinking uh
D :  Are we still thinking about this screen sorry . Go ahead .
B :  Oh go ahead .
D :  The uh if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ? Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  'S definitely an option technically . I've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not , they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point .
D :  Okay .
D :  We're doing okay .
D :  'Cause it seems like an interesting option especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , you can have
A :  Okay .
D :  menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things that you're not gonna use every day and that a lot of people aren't gonna use but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Gotta wonder though , if we're adding so much technology to this one remote , are we still gonna be able to meet out twelve pou our twelve fifty Euro you know goal for selling these things . It seems like , we're not gonna be able to handle all these functions with just one microchip . The microchip is probably the most expensive part of the the whole mechanism . So it's just something to consider .
D :  True .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Worth looking into .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  True .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Absolutely . Mm 'kay um well yeah I guess we'll cross that bridge um in a la slightly later stages of development um but yeah I know , that's perfectly viable question . Mm 'kay um so I'm seeing that we're gonna just basically focus on this young demographic group , aim it at them , but then in a sense that its bells and whistles are available for anybody who wants them but basically we'll make a sleek simple functioned um uh remote control . Um I think this voice recognition thing is a we've got a market for it uh I don't think there's too many , we'd more or less be cornering the market on it as well , we don't have many um .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I appear to have lost my microphone . Mm .
A :  Right um we don't have many people or there's not very many competitors out there that do that so cool . Um right . I guess we've c we've touched on most of this . The idea of a paging function , a touch screen , and face plates . Um .
A :  The thing with I see would there not be a we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ?
C :  Um I'm not sure that's sincerely correct , I think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . We could have the casing , the the face plates .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm . Just the casing .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Back to the uh the cost the material . We have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? That's something I w for say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up . And the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ? We haven't done any tests on face plates and whether
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
B :  See if there if there's even interest out there . Off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Right .
A :  Yeah 'cause then ha you would have to who all it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know Nokia model X_ and then ten people make face plates for it , we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control .
D :  Mm .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , it is sort of emblematic whereas you're just sit at home , so unless somebody comes over to watch T_V_
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm . Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house and most people have their televisions in the living room . Uh .
D :  True . True . True .
A :  Alright well we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um . True , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um yeah we'll cross that bridge later um but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . Um I think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , n s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah .
C :  Sure .
C :  Well have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um
A :  Yeah yeah okay . Um
C :  Interface ?
A :  Yeah I think that would be best . Let's based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic
A :  built or uh b plastic cased 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic as you recommended and I think that's a great idea . With a touch screen for the basic functions . Um
A :  And we'll yeah tha let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff that one basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . Um do we have
A :  Mm wait a minute it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls .
A :  Yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost .
D :  True .
D :  'Cause it would have a docking base ?
A :  Mm-hmm . But then again that costs as well . Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ?
A :  Do they ? Okay .
C :  Those new ones .
D :  Can we afford that ?
B :  Can we afford to include one of those ?
D :  And will somebody buy it if we don't ?
A :  Well I I don't think yeah I can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . Okay so let's go with a um touch screen
D :  Right .
A :  with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology
D :  For twelve Euros ?
A :  Yeah well hey you know well it's it's worth looking into , if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple you know so you know . Well yeah I mean you can put the we could I I dunno I mean I suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest you know , you know people know the channel and volume function make them large and easy to get at and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics . Okay so we'll touch screen and the battery , focus on um uh presentation .
D :  It is .
D :  Fair enough .
D :  The basics .
D :  Mm .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um
B :  Right .
A :  and um a small paging function . Even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button that's just a I guess another infrared signal to the remote control and while to emit some kind of paging . Just a beep .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um right so any comments ? Thoughts before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this .
B :  Since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? Or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody .
C :  Be interesting .
D :  Mm .
B :  What what would be on that touch screen ? 'Cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um
D :  And oh . Yeah the the fashion do . Yeah .
B :  logo or something or motto , I can't remember exactly what you said .
C :  We put fashion into electronics .
A :  W it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . Yeah I think perhaps good idea but yeah I think that that one m might just be um
D :  Right , and then you're dealing with ports and cords and
B :  'S too much .
D :  Yeah .
A :  and they just yeah I think that one might just be out of the range for this particular a P_D_A_ would they would makes a lot of sense for a P_D_A_ 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway but
D :  For now .
A :  I dunno , what do you guys think ?
B :  Think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . That'd be okay .
D :  Yeah . Nice .
C :  Yeah . Uh I I'm I'm in agreement with that , I'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device .
D :  Um .
D :  Well but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading and then it goes away , perhaps it could be like a temporary
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something I think .
B :  Mm . True .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  I'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Y
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah I know I d it seems like it would suffice to have just the R_R_ on there .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah you would think . But .
A :  But apparently not . So .
B :  People aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . They just want it to be on and ready to go .
D :  If it comes from above .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well fair enough . Um and yeah that would help the battery life too and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . But then again who wants to turn on a remote control . Kind of if i
C :  Well all you have to do is touch the screen and it automatically goes on . Yep . Goes into a sleep mode .
D :  Mm .
A :  Oh to wake up okay or go into like a dormant mode . Okay . Oh yeah I like that I like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . Um .
A :  Um cool so any last things before we break ?
A :  Alright . Fair enough .
A :  Sounds good .
D :  We're good ?
A :  I'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . I'm gonna save a copy of this and the minutes that I'll do it in a second and put them in the shared folder for later reference .
C :  I've put my files in the shared folder as well .
A :  Brilliant .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That's fab guys . Cool .
A :  Okay . Um welcome to our second meeting . This is the functional design meeting . And I hope you all had a good individual working time . Okay , let's get started . Okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . After the opening um I am going to
A :  fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . And we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . Then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . Um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . And then we're gonna close up the meeting . And we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes .
A :  Okay . First I want to discuss the goals of this meeting . First we need to determine the user requirements and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . And then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for .
A :  And then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , that's the whole technical side of
A :  'Kay I'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Oh , well let's go ahead and , back , previous . So what I wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . Who would like to start us off ?
C : 
A :  'Kay .
C :  I don't mind going first .
A :  Okay . Um do you have a PowerPoint or no ?
C :  Yeah , it's in the should be in the m Project .
A :  Okay .
D :  Do you want us to do our PowerPoints now or
C :  You know you could you could do it yourself actually .
A :  Oh .
B :  Did you send it ?
A :  Save it in the project documents . Okay .
C :  Put it in Project Documents , yeah .
A :  Mm-mm-mm .
A :  This one ? Okay .
C :  Sure .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Great .
C :  Okay .
C :  Um well , the function of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera .
C :  Um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off ,
C :  the channel going up and down ,
C :  volume going up and down , and then mute ,
C :  a mute function . And then functions for V_H_S_ , D_V_D_ , for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . And enter would be for like , you know , the menus . And then other menus for D_V_ as well as T_V_ , whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus .
C :  And we can decide if that's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the T_V_ itself , for example .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  These are two examples . Um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , and I don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . And then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . So you have functions that are d uh duplicating .
A :  Right .
C :  And you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . So that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version .
C :  Okay .
A :  Ready .
C :  And then lastly , it's just the questions that we want to consider like what functions do we want it to include , and how simple , complex it should be ? And what functions it needs to complete . Uh , what are needed to complete insulation process , 'cause , you know , that's something that also has to be considered and it's gonna be hopefully a one-time thing , when you set it up it should be set to go , but we have to include the functions that can allow it to set up i in the first place .
C :  So that's it .
A :  Alright . Very good presentation . Thank you . You speak with such authority on the matter . Okay . Who would like to um follow that one up ?
C :  Mm . Left .
A :  Now , that we've discussed Okay . Do you want me to run it or you wanna Okay .
D :  I can go .
D :  Yeah , you should run it .
A :  Functional requirements . 'Kay .
D :  Mm yes .
A :  Alright . Now we have Courtney with the functional requirements .
D :  Yes , okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . Seventy five percent think they're ugly . Eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , and basically w we just need something that really I mean there's some other points up there , but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . So that's really what we need to do . And we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . So
C :  Wait .
C :  And that meaning what ?
D :  Like
D :  They like I guess use the buttons a lot . Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  I don't know . It's from my uh research .
C :  Right .
A :  Okay , what do you m Oh , I'm sorry . What do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons .
D :  My team wasn't very clear . That's okay .
C :  Only use ten percent of the buttons .
D :  I I think it's like the engineering versus user , whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really .
A :  Okay .
A :  Oh , right .
A :  The buttons .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Okay .
B :  We only use ten per cent of our brains .
C : 
D :  Good point . It's a necessary evil .
A :  It works . Ready for the next slide ?
B :  yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm . And so people say that they typically lose it , as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , much like any small appliance like a cellphone , and they we need something simple , because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , and we don't want to go we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , but I mean they do need to be able to identify it , and R_S_I_ , I'm not very sure what that is .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Lost .
A :  It's okay . It's very important .
D :  Yes , it is important for the remote control world .
C :  Wait , is that like your
C :  ergonomics like your hand movements or something ?
A :  Could be , yeah .
D :  Uh possibly .
B :  Do we really need t to provide more information on what R_S_I_ is ?
C :  Like
D :  Uh yeah , that's what my web site said , I
A :  Oh .
C :  Channel , volume , power .
D :  don't know .
A :  I think that's a pretty good guess though .
D :  Yeah , I would assume so . I think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . But also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , but those are the definitely the top ones .
C :  It's like if you're holding it
A :  Yeah . It's okay .
A :  Okay . Next slide ?
D :  Yes .
D :  And so personally I think that we need a modern eye-catching design , but it it really needs to be simple . So saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , I think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . Where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . Um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it .
A :  User-friendly .
D :  And it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a D_V_D_ player , a TiVo , what what exactly are we using it for , as well as the age range . So we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . And also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing they really consumers are really interested in it , and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it .
A :  And so just to just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ?
D :  I guess so , yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know .
A :  Oh , that'd be lovely .
D :  Yeah , I guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the T_V_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it
C :  It's kinda like what the remote phone used to do .
A :  Mm . Oh , yeah , that's true . We could definitely include that if we wanted to .
C :  You know like go to the base . Yeah .
A :  If it's within our price . Okay . Are we ready for our last presentation , Amber ?
B :  Yeah , I'm just trying to move it .
A :  Okay .
B :  'Kay . I think it should be there , working design .
C :  Working design .
A :  There we go .
A :  'Kay .
B :  'Kay . Uh I didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that I was given were frustrating . Uh okay , so method method of our design , I think I just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . We need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . Um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . Either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart .
A :  Oh my bad .
D :  Oh that's fine .
C :  Help me .
D :  What exactly is a smart chip ?
B :  Usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions .
C :  Well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? Is that gonna push us over our production costs ?
B :  I wouldn't think so , 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . And they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Ready ?
B :  Um yep , nothing here .
A :  That's okay .
B :  Um power source , I figured , batteries , 'cause they're easily available . Typically a remote has either two double A_s or four triple A_s , sometimes three . Uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . Um a large on-off button , demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , so a large on-off button would probably be good . Selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the D_V_D_ player or the T_V_ or the stereo system .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Um smart chip that perverts uh that permits , sorry , universal application again ,
B :  something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , and that's kinda it . Uh this is my fifty second design .
B :  Power source over here . We're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . Um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . Um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to .
D :  So what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ?
B :  This is just like a rough schematic . So this is the internal workings .
A :  So this would be the front ? So the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? Okay .
D :  Oh okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the T_V_ , but the other bulb , I think , is good to just to indicate , I'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance .
A :  The l the light up kind of Yeah .
D :  Like that we know the battery's working .
B :  Yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when I push this button , is it working ? We can skip that whole thing . Yep .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  It'd probably be lighting up the key too , right ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
B :  So you can put it in the dark .
A :  The buttons .
D :  Yeah , and that's good . We should make it glow in the dark .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , definitely . 'Kay nex R Ready ?
B :  Yeah , that's it .
A :  'Kay , any p 'Kay ?
D :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . Anything else ?
B :  I think that that's a good idea , because you know that's one of the most important buttons .
C :  Just
A :  Okay .
C :  Well , should it be larger buttons in general , you know like uh the examples that I had , they were swi quite small . So should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ?
D :  I think we should . Like I think that would be in a as in like in for the design , sorry , um . I think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , I think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles .
A :  Mm .
C :  Ovals .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Okay . Okay , let's talk about all of our
A :  We'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , let's um wrap up this one , and I'm gonna go back to my PowerPoint , 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . Wait , come back .
A :  Alright . Sorry , let's go through this . Alright . Here we go . New product requirements . First it's only going to be a T_V_ remote . We're trying not to over-complicate things . So no D_V_D_ , no TiVo , no stereo . It's not gonna be multi-functional .
B :  Okay .
A :  Hey . And we th need to promote our company more , so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote .
A :  We're trying to get our name out there in the world . Okay . And you know what teletext is ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  in States we don't have it , but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , it's very um bland looking , it's just text on the screen , not even Yeah , just black with just text .
C :  I know .
D :  What is it ?
C :  Yeah , it's like black , black and white kind of
D :  Like running along the bottom ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  You can also get the kind of the T_V_ guide so
C :  It'll give you the sports .
D :  Wait , is it like the Weather Channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ?
A :  Kind of .
C :  Except the entire screen .
B :  It's the entire screen is just running information at random . Seemingly .
A :  Yeah it's the whole screen .
C :  You can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , you know it's like
A :  So anyway
D :  So it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ?
A :  Right . Right . But it's becoming out-dated now , because of the Internet . Nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so Those are our new product requirements . Alright . Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . So , do we have to include the company colour within that ?
D :  Okay .
A :  Yes . It's part of the logo .
A :  Okay .
C :  Company colour being yellow .
A :  What we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions and just definite things that we need to do and then we'll close up the meeting . So . Alright .
A :  Whatever .
A :  Okay .
A :  So our target group is You mentioned um older people ? Would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? Because I think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  It's gonna make it nicer .
C :  Yeah .
A :  non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . I mean they want something user-friendly , so
B :  Mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , I mean , young and old , all age ranges , all um , not kids obviously , right ?
A :  Or kids ?
D :  No , kids need to know how to use a remote , I would think . They gotta change between Disney Channel , Cartoon Network .
B :  Most of them will intuitively pick it up though .
A :  Okay , so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range Um what about
D :  Yeah , I think we need it all .
A :  technic technical um specifications , like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ?
D :  Um I would say we should say dumber than the average person .
A :  Okay .
C :  We should go for the lowest denominator .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Right , okay .
C :  High school educated .
A :  So so they need no technical experience to operate
B :  how 'bout little to no , because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no .
A :  Okay . And we also need to determine the specific functions of this , just to get it all out on paper . So we said it needs to send messages to the T_V_ , needs to change the channel , turn on and off , just basic simple stuff like this . So if you have something just say it and we'll add it to my meeting minutes .
C :  Well it's channel , on-off button , volume , mute .
A :  Mm-hmm , volume .
D :  And channel . Yeah . Those are the most important ones .
A :  Right . And we wanna keep um I'll make a note here that we wanna keep the number of buttons down . Correct , because people only use ten percent . 'Kay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hey , what else ?
C :  Um .
A :  Um .
B :  Do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ?
A :  I think so . What do you
D :  Sure , yeah .
A :  A finding kind of device or Yeah , ho homing device .
D :  I need we we need a like homing device .
B :  like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ?
C :  Oh right yeah okay .
A :  Mm 'kay .
C :  Tracking .
A :  Okay .
D :  Because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech .
B :  What if we gave it a charger ? And on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you .
A :  Right .
C :  But you got a base .
D :  Do you think people'll really go for that though ?
D :  Because
B :  It's useful for the remote phone .
A :  Hmm . Would that add to our costs at all , I wonder ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  I would think so , because you'd have to develop a base .
A :  Right .
C :  Well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . I I think we can make a decision about that later . Uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . So that would include battery source
A :  Power source rather . Is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? And we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that .
D :  Right .
D :  Do w
C :  Well , then we could If we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic .
A :  Mm .
D :  Well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , I don't know if you guys ge
A :  You could um we could hook it up . Oh .
D :  It wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . So basically older people don't really care .
D :  It's really the people twenty five to thirty five . I feel those are the people that really watch a lot of T_V_ though . They're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  just sitcoms and stuff .
C :  Well
A :  And if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has
D :  Right .
C :  Well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it .
D :  So
A :  Right .
A :  Yeah . and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . If we said , find remote , locate remote , or something .
D :  Right .
A :  A certain phrase
A :  then it could beep . I dunno . Just throwing it out there .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well
C :  Still fifteen minutes .
C :  Um .
A :  Okay , anything else we wanna discuss ?
C :  Well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? Can we conceive of leaving them out ?
A :  Um .
D :  Wait , on the remote itself ?
C :  Yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero .
A :  How how , yeah , how would you leave those out ?
D :  Well , we definitely need those .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well , I don't know , I mean , if you can like well I don't know , if there's just a way of leaving them out ?
A :  Unless you could say the channel .
B :  I think people would find that too foreign .
D :  Yeah . You definitely need
A :  Yeah , that's true . And also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . I used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . So I couldn't whenever I got cable , I had to get a new T_V_ .
B :  It's when we get satellite .
A :  Mm . get your own remote , or digital cable . 'Kay . Um .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . Um .
B :  Yeah , 'cause I don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so
A :  'Kay . And don't forget we need to include the colour
A :  of our company and the logo .
D :  Wait .
C :  The colour being yellow ?
A :  I'm guessing . And the R_R_ .
C :  And how do we
D :  I feel like a ye I feel like a yellow one would be too garish .
B :  R_ the double R_ .
A :  We could just have the logo in yellow , or maybe a yellow light for the keys .
C :  Can't make it entirely
B :  Or is the l
D :  Or put like stripes , oh yeah , yellow lights .
B :  Yeah , yellow could be and it could doesn't have to be huge .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well if you have like a Hang on . If you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the R_R_ .
A :  Right .
A :  So we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind ,
C :  Right , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  or no menu buttons . So we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um can we go back to I'm gonna look really quickly back at those
C :  Two examples . Yeah .
A :  examples and see if there is anything . Which one is yours , technical functions or functional requirement ? Okay .
C :  Oh , it's a Yeah .
D :  Yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ?
A :  The T_V_ . I think that that's fine just for the T_V_ . I mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ?
C :  Well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . It's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , and like on television like I know f k living in Los Angeles it's tons of Spanish network television if it has English sub-titles it's definitely helpful .
C :  and so it's like
A :  Couldn't we do that all through one button , something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the T_V_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , you know ?
C :  I don't well , I don't know .
C :  Right .
D :  So we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons .
C :  Well , that could be No you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons .
A :  For the menus .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  That's true .
D :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Channel is just up and down .
D :  Okay , yeah .
C :  And then add a
A :  Something that looks mayb you know .
D :  Such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one .
A :  Y right , right right right . That one ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  So we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed , including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now
A :  Right . In the middle perhaps .
C :  included in the menu .
A :  Yep .
D :  Ooh , I just got an idea for a design .
A :  good .
A :  Anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ?
B :  I had something , but I forgot .
A :  Okay . get out of here . Let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . Mm .
A :  Alright . After this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . And then we're gonna have lunch break . And after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . Um I'm gonna put the minutes I put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , if you'd like to review them . And I'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . Um here's what we're each going to do . The I_D_ is going to work on the components concept , um U_I_D_ the user interface concept , and you're going to do some trend watching .
A :  'Kay . Specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . And if anybody has anything they would like to add ? No ? Okay , well , this meeting is officially over .
A :  Thank you all .
D :  Okay .
A :  'Kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . Welcome everybody . Um hope your sessions went well . Um so this is our functional design meeting , we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . Um I've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , and I'll be putting them in the shared documents folder so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . Um I I'll get the ones up for next time , um they're not finished yet . Right . Um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this sure .
D :  And I can start if you want . Mm .
D :  Is there an order ? No . We haven't decided on an order .
A :  Hm ?
A :  No , any any order's fine . Yeah .
D :  First . Okay . Um , how do I put this I'll just put the cable in .
B :  Just uh
A :  Oh yeah , sorry .
D :  Is that it ? Can you see ? Oh , here . Okay .
D :  So what happens it doesn't work ?
A :  It sh it takes a few seconds I think .
B :  You may need to
C :  Who's that ?
D :  No .
C :  .
D :  Is it in the right thing ?
B :  But sometimes you have to do it it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press F_ eight .
D :  Oh wait , um .
D :  Uh . You need to help me .
A :  Uh-huh , and then press function .
D :  Yeah .
A :  and F_ eight .
C :  Could you just plug it back into hers because she had oh .
D :  Oh , wait . That's is that it ?
B :  Adjusting .
A :  Here we are .
B :  The cable might be a little loose or something . Oh , you got it .
D :  Right here we are . We're here . Okay , um . In order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um
A :  Oh . Is it on ? Okay .
D :  a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory through just their habits to n know their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . Um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . Custome Customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , they don't like the way they feel , they don't think they match their operating behaviour , and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most and I think we should design according to these buttons . Easy to lose , and R_S_I_ . I don't know what R_S_I_ means . Um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , I don't have a clue .
A :  Hm .
D :  Um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , I have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . So the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . They're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . And um
D :  yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , so this is the order . Channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . The other ones are the settings , and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , and this means that I think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , and then , just one , and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . Um ,
D :  about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . And if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , I don't really know how to describe this , um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . Um I don't I don't know um what the decision to be made is , but I think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , but we should discuss this together .
D :  And that's all I have to say about the matter , um .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Shall I what do I do ? Do I give this to someone else ?
A :  Yeah . Just move right on .
C :  Right .
C :  So get this .
C :  Okay so now I need to press F_ eight , what is it ?
A :  Uh function F_ eight .
D :  Function F_ eight .
C :  'Kay . What's function ?
A :  It's the little blue w it's the one th yeah .
C :  Oh function , I see it .
C :  There we go .
A :  Yeah should be
A :  It should be yeah .
C :  Okay . Um .
C :  This my presentation about the uh technical functions design and I basically just tried to focus on um
C :  just what what functions we need and how to make that
C :  the best function for the user . So uh and I just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet . And okay so basically um I think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . Um so I think things like uh
C :  you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way , uh or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , and also things like is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough large enough I'm not sure we c I guess we would need to
C :  do some research about , I would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the T_V_ . Does it have like capacity to change the channels ? Um does it do or do we need to have like functions for cable or V_C_R_ ? And then , is it findable , and uh how do we wanna do that ? And um
C :  I just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , um I dunno if this will work but
C :  And I think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those .
C :  Just I mean I like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , uh but I mean I think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user .
C :  That concludes my presentation .
C :  Okay . You need the little thingy .
C :  Ooh .
B :  How do I um
D :  That's on view . Oh .
B :  Right .
B :  Okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , um and the method I used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting .
B :  Um so I think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the T_V_ . And also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the T_V_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is .
B :  So the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , um input which would probably be buttons , although um we just talked about voice recognition , processor to take the information , um something to transmit it to the T_V_ , and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . And also you need a sender for location signal , which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their T_V_ or stick it on their wall .
B :  And this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . Power comes from the battery , goes to the chip ,
B :  um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb which is probably the easiest way to send to the T_V_ . And then for the location function , you would have a sender on the T_V_ which would output some sort of signal , um we could use I_R_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . That signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up .
B :  Um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , um a button pad for input , um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , I_R_ transmitter to communicate to the T_V_ , that's just sort of standard , um so most T_V_s have an I_R_ receiver . Probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it and I'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . So that concludes my presentation .
A :  'Kay .
C :  Do you know about like I dunno , you seem like you know about
B :  Mm ?
B :  Yeah , uh I d I was an engineer before I came here .
C :  Okay . Cool .
A :  Okay . Well thank you everybody . Um we have we'll discuss that and then I just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . Um , teletext is apparently outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . Um ,
A :  also our remote should be used only for television , um , no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . Um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , so um the
A :  phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , so let's be fashionable I guess . Um if we have something I mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . Okay . Um .
A :  So we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . Um ,
A :  yeah . Do Let's I guess we should yeah make some
A :  kind of brainstorming , see what we can
C :  Like in terms of
D :  How it looks or
C :  how it looks , or like what it does ?
A :  wha what um well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group and I dunno the the s the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . So .
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  So
C :  Is our target group then people so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ?
C :  So
A :  I think that seems to yeah . Mm .
B :  It's easy to implement .
C :  Okay . So the yeah , yeah , yeah . So then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , what was it ?
D :  the the buzzer you mean , yeah , for sure , yeah .
B :  Locator .
A :  Yeah , teenagers and young professionals .
D :  Well that's for speech recognition .
C :  Oh .
B :  Well
A :  Oh , uh .
D :  And screen . That's only for speech recognition and screen .
B :  I was thinking about that but uh I mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , and also , if the T_V_ is on it's making sound and the people on the T_V_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the T_V_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , or it seems like a silly , I'm not sure how you would implement it .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah . I mean
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  I just put the values in . But um the screen is the same as what ,
A :  And if if you consider our budget , it probably if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . Yeah . Right so um yeah .
B :  It's a cool idea but
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I'm happy with that . Completely .
C :  Hu yeah .
C :  Okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the T_V_ itself .
B :  Well you would have to have a button on a T_V_ or on your wall or some place since the T_V_ already has power . Yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , and I was thinking , I_R_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the T_V_ it's not gonna work , um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . Sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Okay . Alright .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  So you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can right .
B :  It would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  So do you plug it in the T_ you plug it in T_V_ , this thing ?
B :  Yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your T_V_ so if you need to find the remote , click the button .
D :  Okay . Okay .
C :  So it's now like a two-part thing . Okay . Alright .
B :  Yeah , so it would be a two part package .
D :  Okay .
C :  So we get to design that too . Make it fashionable .
C :  Um , okay .
A :  So do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . Huh .
B :  Yeah I think so .
D :  Yeah . Just there .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm . Are we um should that thing be on the thing to put the you s you talking about a home for it . Do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall or shall we leave that for now ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  We probably leave that . I mean I guess one takes care of the other , like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Then it can live anywhere .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . For the so you have that button , that so there's is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Are we just having a radio ?
B :  Um on the T_V_ or on the phone ? Um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , I think that's what the phone has , I mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever .
D :  On the phone .
D :  You don't need a light . Yeah yeah yeah . Yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so yeah .
D :  You can hear it's under the couch yeah . Um ,
C :  So i Yeah .
D :  So need the other buttons . So we have this mm .
A :  So I mean the two remotes that you had shown r I don't remember who showed them , yeah you you did um , they're I mean one looked like it was for V_C_R_ type thing , and the other looked like just television .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That was that was me .
C :  I think w I think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . And uh
A :  Oh really .
A :  'Cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have V_C_R_ capabilities .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Does anyone know if V_C_R_s are the same across international ?
A :  They're not no .
D :  They're not , no .
B :  Okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's V_C_R_s .
A :  Yeah , that's right , yeah . But D_V_D_ probably is .
D :  It not V_H_S_ here ?
B :  Yeah , other than that region and coding thing .
C :  Um
D :  But V_C_R_s
A :  And and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , I mean it's gonna be D_V_D_ type , that's the the technology these days .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , for sure .
C :  Yeah . So . Okay , let's see if I can I think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know , like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the T_V_ .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Well for sure we need the um I think we can just design the
D :  channels ? I mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , s and it's usually that red and I think it's quite nice to keep it like red .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Huh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  You know , I've seen some remotes that where you just hold one , like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . So you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just
D :  Oh okay , yeah .
C :  It seems like that would be hard though . I mean , like because unless you know yeah . Just 'cause I wouldn't I would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . Yeah . B Yeah .
A :  But
A :  It might be confusing . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Besides you like to be able to go power . I have the power I guess . So we definitely want a power button and numbers . Right .
B :  Yeah , I never think to hold something down .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Well even um iPod thing , like um , I don't know if people like this but if you want to reduce the number ,
D :  of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of
C :  That sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah .
D :  scrolling I don't know . Yeah . Because people li seem now the iPod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no
A :  Mm .
D :  Know you don't have one two three four five
C :  Yeah , yeah . I think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool , it's it's funny like you f like I just I don't have an iPod but like I , you know , I just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , and you just sort of and it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , like it's not that hard , you know .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah , it's just and it's one thing which has everything .
C :  Yeah , and it is yeah . It is really but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ?
D :  Well can't it tell the like can't you if you you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then
B :  Yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner .
C :  Yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah . Okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button .
A :  Oh that's gonna
A :  Is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of okay .
C :  Like a disc .
C :  Yeah . Yeah . It's like it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad .
D :  It's like l this like that , and then you do that .
A :  I've never used one . No .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  And then you can have um if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing
C :  Yeah and then .
D :  like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus .
C :  Okay . So like it's like a little part of the circle that
C :  Or it oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can
D :  Yeah , you can
A :  Well i
D :  Yeah , click o actually click on to have
C :  zap . Okay .
A :  We could we could even have four buttons , like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . So volume could be like the top it and the bottom So do you need to okay .
B :  Doesn't it rotate though , so it'll be moving around .
C :  Well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like
D :  What do you mean the function ?
C :  I mean like okay , 'cause so
C :  I dunno , I guess Okay so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . That that means you're gonna go up the channels , and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . But then so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down .
D :  Yeah but it knows for some reason . The iPod knows .
C :  It just
C :  It just kno the iPod knows . S
B :  If it works on an iPod then it works .
C :  Yeah . So you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want .
A :  Huh .
B :  I don't have one .
D :  Well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up .
C :  Okay . That's what I mean . Okay .
C :  Okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down .
B :  Oh .
D :  And then well if you do that it goes , but if you like that makes more sense 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that I've seen .
A :  So it's like holding
A :  You can o
A :  And you
A :  you is there an extra actual button ? Or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down . Like
D :  Well what you for the iPod you press an w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . But if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , I'm pretty sure
C :  It's like a b
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well I mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ? Like you could just have
D :  Yeah .
D :  I don't know , you could click and then have it up and down , but I think
A :  Oh , like
C :  Like
A :  Oh you could actually
C :  I think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the iPod . But the only thing is like , iPods are so expensive , like , it has to be is that part of yeah , I dunno , I dunno . You don't think so ? Okay .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Is that what makes them expensi I think it's all of they have so much memory though , that's it's
B :  I don't think so .
B :  I don't think it's the wheel dealy .
D :  I think it
A :  Yeah . I think it's the uh h it's their capabili I mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . I'm thinking we could if if we're hav So ba I mean but an iPod just has that circle thing you know .
B :  .
B :  And they're re-programmable aren't they ? You can put on your songs and then put on a different set , that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah . Well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . Because , the other thing ,
D :  I didn't tell you all my presentation , is that people find it
D :  find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote and that's another thing they complained about . Um , what other buttons were there ? Volume oh we've ts just said that .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So okay . This is just for T_V_ , it's not for or it is does need to be compatible with
D :  Channel selection .
B :  I
A :  Um
B :  A D_V_D_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject ,
C :  Yeah . So how do you switch
D :  Menu .
A :  You know actually our our new project requirements , I'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for D_V_D_ or just not internet type things . So I'll I'll check that and update you on the next But we'll hold off on that 'cause
B :  and menu maybe .
B :  Oh yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  So like if we had that
C :  Yeah .
A :  But s yeah uh .
D :  But D_V_D_ players usually have their own remote .
C :  That's true , yeah . So , I know I'm not c really clear on what
A :  Yeah .
B :  But it's cool to have it all on one , because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm . Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So you'd have to have like I think you would have to have like a function switch button , you know somewhere so like you can you're either on T_V_ , you're on D_V_D_ or you're on V_C_R_ , or you're like . So
A :  Yeah .
B :  Well but D_V_D_ is only like four buttons .
D :  Yeah , it is only fun
C :  Yeah , but I mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad .
A :  But i
B :  Oh . But I think the circle only does channel isn't applicable to D_V_D_ really 'cause you don't wanna but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the T_V_ so you don't have to switch .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah but it it would be
C :  So but I'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , so like you're if you're on T_V_ , like you can switch channels , but then if uh if you're on D_V_D_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks or s you know , to different I mean do we need to think about that , that like
A :  Um , yeah , let's think about it 'cause we need to wrap up . Um let's see . Um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , um yeah , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . See you soon .
B :  Yes we can try that .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay , welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group .
A :  I'll briefly go through the uh
A :  notes of the of the last meeting
A :  uh just done in in note form and I haven't attributed anything to individuals , because we're working strictly as a team here and uh n nobody's working equally , so uh . Um we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour .
C :  Sorry .
A :  Um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items , that switching was easy ,
A :  that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular , um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , that the keys might be concave , simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . Um should have interchangeable fascias so people can personalise it , um illuminated so that people can see it in dark rooms . Um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls . Um and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you uh um
A :  mm uh use it . And that it shouldn't be too small , mm that it it gets lost .
A :  Um .
A :  Now uh
A :  uh I'll shortly ask for for three three presentations . Uh before I do that , however , I will go through some new project requirements that um the the management have placed on us and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . Um the uh
A :  the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought . Um and and then we'll as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out , and we have uh forty minutes to do this in and I uh
A :  Anyway . Okay .
A :  Now , the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . Um and and they want it only to cover televisions .
A :  Um now , what is not q quite clear from their directive is whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , D_V_D_s , um satellite boxes , which uh I mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . The um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only .
A :  Um and on that basis um I I think we we need to bear that in mind , um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . Um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . Um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two R_s in grey against uh a yellow background .
A :  Um now this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . But uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that . Um it also has to be simple , which to some extent goes along w with the first one , and that we've already said that it must be simple 'cause that's what people want anyway . Um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , which um
A :  mm uh is is is their choice , but uh um we we need to talk that through . Um okay , so uh
A :  after the meeting it'll be summarised and uh
A :  um notes sent out and uh etcetera . Okay , so we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody . Um again I there is no order of precedence here um so I I I'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first ?
D :  Uh I don't mind .
A :  P fine .
D :  Uh can I steal the cable ?
A :  Oh sorry , you can indeed .
D :  Cheers .
D :  I got a how do I start there ?
A :  Oh , if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen , no the one to the right of that . That one .
D :  That one . Cool . Well these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab . Took hundred people and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see .
D :  Um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . And general opinions about current current remotes . See that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly .
D :  So some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly . Uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it .
D :  Which is a a plus for us , if we can make it look better , it'd be uh
D :  more cost effective
D :  and we can put the price up .
D :  Current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . I can empl I kinda take that to mean as um
D :  they don't uh they , yeah , they only use they only work for the television or yeah like as in in my flat I've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a D_V_D_ player , a video player and T_V_ . If it was uh I mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour .
D :  Uh again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . I took to mean that they just they use it a lot , they use it regularly rather than standing up and
D :  manually change channels or volume .
D :  And uh
D :  yeah , uh I think the big issue is fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like well we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used and used very aren't considered relevant by the user . So I think maybe fewer buttons , which also make the design look sleeker , I dunno .
D :  Uh um yeah and
D :  uh frustrations of like people losing remote control . I dunno maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the T_V_ or maybe that's b it would have to incorporate , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control .
A :  Mm .
D :  Maybe like it'll beep or something .
D :  And um , yep , the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is
D :  Uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new like first time users and stuff .
D :  And uh repetitive strain injury , I suppose we should make it more comfortable and make ma possibly even use have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , like I was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . Maybe don't even have to hold it as such .
A :  Mm .
A :  Gosh , must be some telly addicts out there if they get R_S_I_ from their television remote , is all I can say .
D :  But uh yeah . It also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition and younger people say they would .
A : 
D :  And uh there was another section on our on the report for uh L_C_D_ displays , but the data wasn't there , so . I don't actually know what the results for that were , so . May be incrementally emitting , but yeah .
A :  Mm . Right .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , I must say that um the uh I c can't remember what um f you know phone service I was using the other day , but that had sorta speech recognition which worked uh remarkably well , so that is indeed a uh
A :  a thought and it it cuts out uh
D :  And uh it would cut out the R_S_I_ as well if you
A :  I was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of R_S_I_ , j just get jaw ache . Okay , sorry .
D :  Yeah , um oh yeah , so possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . Oh , I've got some other things I couldn't fit onto this presentation .
D :  Um .
D :  You see this okay ? Almost no ? It's sorry it's a bit . I'll read out to you . Uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . So um
D :  like the power . Using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on T_V_ is a high relevance of nine , but it's not frequently used . You see what I mean ? Whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance is used the most . So m we can maybe even start to cut down on or I was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . Maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . So that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , which are low relevance and rarely used . And keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm . I mean
C :  It could be oh uh I was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? Have you seen the new mo mobile phones that flip out and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , so you could have the most used buttons on top and flip it out or something . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Hmm , hmm .
D :  Yeah , like the one that like slides back and the buttons are concealed underneath .
B :  Mm .
A :  Uh .
A :  Should we actually bite the bullet here ? If people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether . We we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um
B :  Mm .
D :  Just remove them completely ?
C :  That might be the
A :  I wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , given that um the
A :  Um now the the age structure we were looking at um I mean w we had usage by age structure , what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . Now do we know whether they
D :  Uh yeah .
A :  Forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . Yes we
D :  Um no this is for pay more for speech recognition .
A :  That would 've speech recogn right . So , we're looking at um well again , we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups .
D :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  If we wanted something
A :  different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it .
B :  Well the only problem I can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . If you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . It might
A :  But if you just lift it up and say , channel one or B_B_C_
D :  Or even I mean you could even just have it left on . You could just put it down once on top your T_V_ and never have to
C :  Maybe i
C :  Yeah , have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box and have it just go on the T_V_ and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , you won't lose it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  It c well it I can I can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , I_T_V_ and you're watching B_B_C_ then then it might um change itself , so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it
B :  Mm .
C :  No .
D :  B_B_C_ one .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  just to activate it . Or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . And and then just say , oh I don't know , a thought and and then uh I mean that that would certainly be uh truly different .
D :  Oh yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . I mean if they weren't there ,
D :  Mm-mm .
A :  would people miss them ?
B :  But look at the importance of them . The volume settings .
D :  Relevance of two out of ten , yeah .
A :  Vol volume , yes um th w we need to s identify things that people actually need and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . And um I would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , um the channel and volume and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . Uh channel and volume are the only ones that
B :  Yeah .
B :  They're not used often but they are quite important when they're used . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  uh would appear to be essential .
D :  Stand out .
A :  Um .
A :  So we if we can design something that that looks interesting ,
A :  know , or looks different , um incorporates the the logo and and the colours and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey , um
A :  and uh I dunno , buttons or or buttons as an option .
D :  Uh I just had a thought actually , sorry to interrupt . Uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed we could maybe have like an activation
A :  Do , please .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  word .
D :  'Cause I've seen I've seen this used on computers before , where you just you address the remote , you address the computer , and then give it a command .
A :  You cer certainly could .
B :  Mm .
A :  Depe uh i depends whether um if we want to make this
A :  so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say
D :  Oh I see . Oh yeah , I see .
A :  B_B_C_ one . Um okay , I mean you could
A :  print actually print it on the uh
D :  Mm-hmm , yeah .
A :  device itself .
A :  Um .
D :  I mean I'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote .
A :  S th this I th that's always gonna be a problem I think . Um and I I I s so I suppose one um
D :  Mm .
A :  could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . Anyway , sorry , carry on . Do you want to just carry on with
D :  Oh no I I interrupted you , sorry .
A :  or no no , no uh b I was in the middle of in the middle of your report there .
D :  Oh okay .
D :  Um well , I was just kinda wrapping up there . Yeah , I was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . We could make things much more f I think the the eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better ,
A :  Mm okay .
D :  combined with uh decrease the or take out the limited functio functions that we don't really use much . alright take out teletext , but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . But , since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  S s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um 'cause we're
D :  Oh , we could , yeah .
D :  We c yeah , we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , so .
A :  Certainly could . Yeah , yeah .
D :  So uh yeah , if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really
B :  Mm .
A :  The I mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper .
D :  Yeah and probably it would look better as well .
A :  No , it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive .
D :  Yeah . yeah .
A :  Um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box .
B :  Mm .
D :  Lined with numbered buttons and
A :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Okay , who sorry , have you have you finished there Andy ? Yep , yep .
D :  Uh yeah , yeah , that's everything .
A :  Um given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh .
C :  Okay well , I can do mine .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Do you want the cable ?
C :  Yeah , let's see if I can make this work . Um .
B :  Oh , you have to hit like function and F_ something .
C :  Oh .
D :  F_ eight .
B :  F_ eight .
C :  Is it doing
B :  Dunno .
D :  Uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so .
C :  Okay .
A :  Ah , there we go .
B :  Oh yeah , it's going .
C :  Oh okay .
C :  Okay , so this is just about the technical functions . So the method , I looked online for examples of other similar products and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do . Um and then there are two different kinds that I found . There's a user centred one and an engineering centred one which I will have pictures of and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be .
A :  Alright .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So these are the two different ones . This one um this is the user centred , it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons and then this is the engineering centred , which has a lot more buttons , and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons that you don't use . So basically , what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set , you know , turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . And so for this product it's gonna be television only , and then it has to have the uh logos
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  for the company and the colours . And so , for my personal preferences , I think this one is easier to use and has quite a you know , fewer buttons . Um we want something that sends messages easily to the television and I was kind of wondering about this example that they have . It looks kind of narrow at the top , and I was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , then that would be easier .
A :  Mm , yeah .
C :  Um and so we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . E the unique style , maybe have it light up so it's visible in the dark , um the changeable face-plates , and the lighting up and visible I was when we were talking about havi losing it , maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that .
C :  So that's my presentation .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , can I um I'm actually gonna use the um it's gonna cause great technical problems over here . I'm actually gonna use the
C :  F they probably clip to you .
B :  Oh yeah , they might be movable . Oh yeah , they're all they're not connected to anything on the table , you just leave 'em on and walk around with 'em .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yes , rather than the uh the the traditional in fact , um I won't even go that far . Um something like this shape , you know , sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape , um that you you sort of hold in your hand , um , well I'm trying to think
A :  uh uh uh l uh l such as I mean um something you hold up like that , possibly with a couple of buttons like that , but with the the entire top with the , you know , the uh the infrared or whatever source .
B :  Mm .
A :  Uh so that you know , it's
A :  flying off in all directions , so that uh um uh again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of um
B :  Mm .
A :  actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the uh such a source , um you know , compromise the our our need for uh you know , it it being
A :  um mm permanently
A :  uh you know , available . Uh whether whether different technology um I mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared , and like they have been for a long time . Uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different , um you know , short range , not like the old uh radio remote controls where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours . Um
A :  but uh uh I think basically i if we're going for i if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as I say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , you know , possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . Um and nothing else .
A :  Um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that , but again , except that um you know the risk of losing it . Um anyway okay um so Kate , wh what are your uh your thoughts on this ?
B :  Yes , mm .
C :  Oh .
B :  Which one does this plug into ?
C :  Hmm I think it's all there .
B :  That one .
B :  I can't did you could you see it on you screen when it
C :  Oh yeah . That's kind of strange .
B :  That's not cool . Oh well . Anyways . Um alright , yeah , so um I'll just do my presentation on the working design uh .
B :  Oh there we go .
B :  Okay um just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works . Uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ player or whatever . Um and it does this uh by well , you need to start off you need an energy source and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the D_V_D_ to tell that what to do . Um and you need a user interface , which controls the chip and thus the messages and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . Um
B :  Oh shoot . Okay . Uh just general findings . Uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , uh some sort of user interface , which I think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . Um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver .
B :  And um oops . Uh-huh .
B :  This is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . Uh this just kinda represents the energy source which feeds into the circuit chip uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch which would send signals f to um a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons . Um also send signals to the um infrared bulb , which will be the part that actually what ? Sends signals to the the television . And then you've got your happy little T_V_ watcher there .
D :  Hmm .
B :  And so my personal preferences I I just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery or a battery dock you could place it in , so it'd constantly be charged , so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . Uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . Uh also definitely a user-friendly interface um and I think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . And that's pretty much it .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make before we um I think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one . Um I don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones . Um given
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , that's uh , you know never needs replacing . Um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , uh um you know , one some sort of typical usage . You know , the the the battery will last
A :  know , five , ten years .
A :  By which time I mean when all's said and done , the digital television
A :  will be taking over in that time scale . Um
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment and uh
B :  Just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? Oh , cool .
A :  Yeah , and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give 'em a new one . Um it's , you know , it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a well , it's actually a marketing gimmick . I mean it's hardly a gimmick , it's uh it's totally practical . Uh so I th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um
B :  Yeah , fair enough .
A :  uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , if if it
D :  It could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time .
A :  Yeah . Are are people really gonna use it though ? Um .
B :  Mm , mm .
C :  Yeah , people are pro I would think that people might forget I mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , so .
D :  I suppose , yeah .
B :  Mm yeah .
A :  I I th I think
B :  Mm-mm .
A :  Yeah , it's um I mean I know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning and says oh I should have put the phone on to charge and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . Um .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  'Cause I only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies . And that's pretty much yeah . Yeah , when it turns itself off , that's when I plug it in , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  When it yeah , wh when it's died is a problem . Yeah , yeah , yeah , so uh um what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ?
B :  Yeah , think that's a good idea .
C :  No .
D :  Uh . That sounds pretty good , yeah .
A :  Is the uh you know , we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here . Um you know , cut cost within the
C :  Um .
B :  Mm .
A :  manufacturing and uh
A :  you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective .
C :  Do they make batteries that last that long ?
A :  I mean th th certainly . Um I can't think of anything off the s top of my head , but there are certainly things that you buy . I mean calculators for example .
B :  They usually have the little light uh source , I dunno what the heck they're called , the but yeah , the little cells that
C :  Yeah , they have that little solar
A :  Som well some do , I mean th th but there are battery ones that um are you know , sort of permanently sealed . In in fact I'd
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Most of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two , like when there is light , they'll work off the light , and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , so we can maybe do something like that whereas there is a battery , but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , but you will have the battery there for when you need it .
A :  Yeah , uh uh
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , I I mean th th this needs going t into the technology a bit . I mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  I would think is
A :  i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life .
B :  Oh , it depend if it's uh depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking , yeah . Yeah , then they're clicking a lot , yeah .
A :  Um .
C :  Yeah , some people are
A :  If , but I say if if people are getting R_S_I_ from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market n
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  W like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight
C :  Per hour ?
D :  times per hour .
A :  Right .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Wow . That's a lot .
A :  Oh , I must admit I hadn't um I'd I'd missed that . That does sound excessive .
D :  But then again , if you think it of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like
A :  Yeah .
D :  That's it's less than a second , um .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Well that's right , and and I I don't I don't even know whether the I don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , or whether it's just a
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  sorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for , I don't know I don't actually know . Um .
C :  Though I think with digital T_V_ , like I know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that , so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  channels that way instead of
A :  Mm .
A :  Right , so I've got a message to say five minutes , I dunno how long ago that appeared . Um 'cause we're we're getting um right , so I'd I need to sum up very quickly here um . We're looking at extreme simplicity .
C :  Uh-oh .
A :  We're looking at a
A :  radically different shape .
A :  Possibly no buttons at all um , but if you can incorporate um
A :  channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine . Um in the I mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , because , you know , shape is no longer an
A :  a uh um a serious constraint . But we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , uh if clearly only need the main functions .
A :  Um I don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition um and the the only buttons that I think we need are channel control , volume control and on off .
A :  Um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable
A :  uh covers . Um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep . Hmm .
A :  Right .
C :  Um
A :  So uh
C :  Oh I just have one question . So are we doing just the television or are we doing so not D_V_D_ players , we okay , okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  We are doing just the television . No .
A :  I think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given , no ?
B :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , like in the email of television only . In fact they're in the constraints email that I got .
A :  Right .
D :  Didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ?
A :  Oh yeah well th that's one I s that's one I sent you , which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh what came down from from head office . Um
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Oh okay . Oh yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  That's that that that that's their uh their view .
A :  Okay , so uh we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting , thank you very much indeed .
C :  Okay .
B :  Cool .
A :  Uh it fell off .
A :  One , two , three , four , yeah , we're ready .
A :  Okay . Welcome to this second meeting . Um it's now quarter after twelve and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting . This is a meeting on functional design . Um and I wanna welcome you all and thank you all for doing some research in between .
A :  Um I did took the minutes from the first meeting and I'll show them to you in a moment . Um I know each of you have a presentation and um in thinking about the forty minutes , I thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , because there's I happen to have been told there were some new project requirements and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . Okay ?
A :  Is this ap everybody agree with this ?
B :  Oops .
C :  Yes .
D :  Yes .
A :  Okay . Um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . Um but uh now for the minutes of the first meeting .
A :  And go to that one . Um as you can see it was this earlier today . Um Kate , Steph , Sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . I opened the meeting , the product was developed uh and reviewed , and we talked about the financial end of it . Um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the Japanese . And we closed early so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting
A :  Anybody have any questions on those minutes ? Are they complete , did they discuss everything that we covered last time ?
A :  'Kay .
B :  Uh I think so , we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well .
A :  Did I miss something ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . I'm afraid I incorporated that when I said who was present , but yes , we did , and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures , but I didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . So um as a group I think we've are they're accepting the minutes .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay , I accept the minutes .
A :  And uh okay .
D :  Is that what we're supposed to say ?
A :  Yeah . Good . Um , then we'll move to the three presentations .
C :  Yeah , I do .
A :  Okay ?
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm we need to move this . Who wants to go f first ?
A :  That's as far as it goes .
C :  Uh not really meant to touch those microphones . Oh it doesn't have any on , does it ? That's fine .
D :  Excellent , thank you .
B :  Oy , big loop under the table .
A :  She said we didn't need to screw it in .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay , that looks good .
A :  It's doing its thing . There we are .
D :  Alright . Thank you very much . Um .
D :  One of the the biggest issues I found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um
D :  remote controls and I think that this is an opportunity to really take Real Reaction in the direction of of similar
D :  of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . So um my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context and to think about menu functionality and current technology and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . Um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , and um that means we do need to
D :  make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . And if we devote some energy into this , I think the um recent productions of Real Reaction , the I go everywhere power and the high definition D_V_D_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , I think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . And um in fact I think the high definition D_V_D_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback
D :  from our well designed tool . So again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . Um fifty percent I think of all these uh numbers the most important is fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . And eighty percent of users , and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television , D_V_D_ , stereo remote control users out there , eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy .
B :  Could can I ask where these figures come from , is this market research we've
D :  Um it was market research and there were a hundred people in the room , so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money .
A :  Now in between , as the Project Manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be um that teletext is outdated um and the internet is coming in as important , but that they want this remote control to only be for T_V_ um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well I think we can I I think we can really focus on this remote and and again bring the Real Reaction um brand in in and and get some positive marketing for our other tools , even if we directly don't um advertise for the I go everywhere line . So an interesting um element was the would you pay more for speech recognition question . So these market research uh uh questionnaires looked into your your uh concern about technology and s specifically wanted to
A :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
D :  find out information about speech recognition .
A :  Okay .
D :  the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Very interesting , I I leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know , the the designers , but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five
A :  Mm .
A :  Is that a large enough target market to target it ?
D :  Well , I I I think especially in terms of growth , I think this would be a very smart group to target . I mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh
A :  In real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  To
D :  Um yes .
A :  Or eight million .
D :  Yes . But would you pay more and does it work and is it approachable and and did I know that it was it was an that's a that's a very good question . I don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included , but I think it's an interesting I think that maybe shows more about uh
A :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um
A :  Mm .
D :  being open to technology .
C :  Uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research on like how much more it would be and any , you know , existing examples , and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing .
A :  Mm .
D :  Shall I go back ?
D :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  How d I'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . I expect an Industrial Designer should know that , but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve Euros fifty , um is that a lot or a little ?
D :  Exactly . I mean I I I uh did not receive any information on that , but I think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , because um there is a question about do you want an L_C_D_ screen and and that wasn't responded to , but uh some of the larger
D :  remotes do have screens where you can navigate , you know , so it turns into something uh perhaps you all have seen uh the Osbournes where Ozzy Osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray . You know , it's I a and I think , you know
B :  Sh surely he's in the wrong age group . He must be w one of a s small population .
D :  No , no , you Kate , you're exactly right there . But I think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology and and uh they'll be
A :  Mm .
A :  But we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , that's looking at age groups .
D :  Uh , mm .
D :  Exactly . I yes , and I'm making and I'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . Or comfortable , you know , um so
A :  Leap .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay , you had the other power channel .
D :  I think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh
D :  up to the designers .
D :  And this is this is also supported by the market research .
A :  Okay .
D :  Thank you . That's my contribution .
A :  Alright . And we'll turn to the next presentation .
A :  I think she said we don't need to screw it in , just stick it in .
A :  And then press , what ? F F_N_ and F_ eight . Next to the control button on the bottom , and then F_ eight at the top .
C :  Yeah , press them .
A :  And then w be patient .
C :  Yeah , here we go .
A :  Tada .
B :  And if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there .
C :  Can I not just uh
C :  do each one in order ?
B :  I you can if you like , it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p no that one , that one there .
C :  That ?
A :  There we are . Yay .
C :  That ?
B :  Left , left a bit , left a bit , that one , yep . And then you just press the click when you wanna go on .
C :  That ?
C :  Right , technical functions design .
C :  Uh well I think first off , basically I do agree with what Sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . I think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions .
C :  So my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . And what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions
C :  uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . If we can build on this with the speech recognition , that's not something I'd thought about at all , but it's also something we can discuss .
A :  Okay .
C :  Um and and I presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or D_V_D_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , T_V_
A :  T_V_ only .
C :  remote control . So these are two models of existing remote controls .
C :  Uh the one on the left
A :  Ugh .
C :  seems to be a fairly
C :  uh standard universal remote control . It has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . It also has seems to have channel up and channel down , which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a Sky or cable remote control where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Uh but I think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , I don't think we need them at all .
C :  I think we just need channel selection ,
C :  volume up , volume down and
C :  I think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . Uh
C :  not related to the internet one that you mentioned , because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do .
A :  Mm .
A :  And exceed the requirements they're expecting of us .
C :  So it really exceed the requirements , 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , which
C :  is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons o I was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access .
A :  Okay .
A :  Alright .
C :  Uh but then I do think we need to discuss the speech
C :  um recognition possibility .
A :  Okay . Any uh thing else you wanna add ? Okay .
C :  No .
C :  But we could go back to the pictures of the
C :  uh , what're they called ?
C :  The pictures of the remote controls
C :  and possibly discuss what we think about them , but maybe should hear what Kate has to say first .
D :  Or if
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Let's hear what Kate has to say .
D :  Maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a
C :  Okay then .
D :  basis .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Whiteboard session .
A :  I think the white that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered ,
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Definitely less cluttered and I mean but still it's
C :  Sorry I was just I'll just uh resume something else I was gonna say . The the style of these is terrible . I I I really think we need to uh
A :  It's there but it's
A :  Yeah .
C :  not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours ,
D :  The ergonomics , the way it fits in your
C :  just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But
C :  So that's that for now .
B :  Cheers .
B :  Mm , I haven't actually got a display on my screen . Still , I'll do without that . Okay um , now I wanna bring us down to earth again I'm afraid and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work .
A :  Okay .
B :  Um oh and this is the methodology I used in preparing for this meeting . Um basically I've been doing a little bit of web-based research , and if I had a design team , I would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . But the the net result is that I've come up with a first cut for the working design that I'd like to discuss with you .
B :  So , let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . It's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . And the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve Euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface and
B :  which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses , we turn that into a message , um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . Now I would have hoped I think that's my only slide actually , yeah . I would have have hoped to um
B :  do you a pretty PowerPoint slide of um my first cut design , but unfortunately the technology defeated me , so if you'll bear with me I'll do it on the whiteboard .
B :  So we want an energy source
B :  which is there .
B :  And we've got to think about what that might be . Uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . Uh typically it would be a battery , but I'm open to suggestions . Um and
A :  Hmm-mm .
B :  then we have the the user interface .
B :  Oops .
B :  And the main components in there are the
B :  the th the chip that actually has the intelligence of the machine that translates button presses into a message , which it then
B :  transfers to some sending mechanism , which encodes it
B :  and sends the message to the receiver . So those are the basic things that we've got to get in for our twelve Euros fifty . Thank you .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right . But those things as long as we can get those components ,
A :  the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in of what what does it look like ? What do the buttons look like ? Uh what does it feel like ? That's where the user interface is really coming into its own . The technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  For example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? Um is there any um because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for D_V_D_s , movies , whatever . Um does it have to have a
A :  a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ?
B :  Well I may be wrong here , but I'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . We're trying to sell four million of 'em , um that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . Um and I hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing , you just if it goes wrong you chuck it out , and that's why I'm a bit concerned . I like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , but I'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  Do we have um
C :  Whoop .
A :  Okay .
D :  ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? Because then
C :  Isn't that your job ?
A :  Oh .
D :  No , the chip composer marketing . Oh no , the chip composer sender .
C :  Oh right .
A :  Mm . What they cost .
D :  I I don't believe I know , um .
B :  Um ,
B :  I'm I'm I'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , but
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  It does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , the which is pretty much the same as these existing models , just maybe
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Inspired ?
C :  a little bit more inspired ,
D :  Mm .
C :  but basically just the same . Although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two A_A_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all .
C :  Could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an M_P_ three player does ? With that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . You could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , and you don't have to worry with replacing A_A_ batteries , which are
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well that has another element , which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place .
A :  Mm .
C :  You'd never need uh batteries would y uh yeah .
D :  Yeah , but it also has a place , so exactly .
C :  And it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . But then again I d I don't know if this is within our price range or not .
A :  Mm .
D :  That's a really good idea .
B :  Well I uh think that's a very interesting idea , but um I'm not a very good industrial designer and I don't know much about what these things cost . I'll do some research for the next meeting .
D :  Well it's better than my idea about solar , probably . Yeah , yeah . Depen
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh yeah .
B :  Well solar may not be so good when you're watching T_V_ in the night , but
A :  Mm .
C :  Well it is just so annoying how
A :  It would have to sor store up the energy
D :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I guess .
A :  and then use it . Solar can do that .
B :  We may be talking quite heavy then .
A :  M yeah , that would be too heavy and it'd cost too much .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  No , but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably I mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky A_A_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer and
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ?
C :  you know f
D :  Definitely , 'cause I'm thinking in terms of um uh
A :  Mm .
D :  the
D :  loss and breakage of um remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home , a um a nest , a place to live , exactly . So if you can dock it , um you know , you could s argue that this is
C :  Mm . Sort of have its little dock that you could put it in .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And the dock could look very fancy and that could be your inspiration of having it looking decent .
D :  Exactly .
C :  Still I don't know if it's quite within our price range .
D :  Mm . 'Cause you are talking about another component , like another piece of hardware .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Are we agreed as to what our target group is though ?
D :  Mm .
A :  Pretty much , so that we'd be looking for the younger end .
D :  Well I I brought up some exactly , but I think you raised some good questions about are there enough of these people out there , or are they making purchasing decisions ? You know , these are the
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , I was wondering that , because I ag I agree that there there're people with uh how can I put it , more money than sense and who are liable to buy something new , but
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , exactly .
A :  I I s usually put more money than brains .
B :  Bu but what I was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that , are they necessarily buying T_V_ remote controls ? Because they probably live in a household that has a T_V_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , I don't know .
D :  Oh oh oh I'll make a note of that , Kate . Good , good comment .
D :  Yeah .
D :  It might be good to know um uh who , you know , who's actually buying televisions and are we in a uh uh s
C :  Yeah .
D :  region where people have more than one television in a home ?
B :  Mm . I think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ? I mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? We sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it .
B :  Right , good point . Yeah , yeah okay , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , good point .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That's probably more what it is .
A :  What would be a more efficient way of doing it ?
D :  Yeah , and and some of our D_V_D_ players incidentally have them , because we have the relationship with our own department , but moreover we need to
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  to go for the the manufacturers .
A :  Okay . Right .
C :  We're not gonna get any resolutions by the end of the day , are we ?
A :  Probably not . Um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . Our functions , we've so far decided , I think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . Um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . It has to have big user-friendly buttons and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired that the current
D :  Mm .
A :  styles are just plain awful .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Do we need um let me
A :  Is that agreeable to everyone ?
D :  Br actually , um
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  the enter key I have a chart here that I didn't include . Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Do you want the gizmo ?
D :  yeah , which might
A :  Throw some light on that .
D :  Th yeah , th those are
D :  felt like had a lot of charts .
A :  Um actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , so we have to get close to finishing .
D :  Okay , I I my only comment is I think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining .
A :  Ah . Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
D :  Um
A :  Enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key .
D :  Exactly . Again , you know , thinking of menus or
A :  Is that okay with you ?
C :  Sorry , I was miles away . I was re I was reading the chart to be honest .
B :  H how does that work ? How so so how does that work , how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ?
A :  Would that uh-huh .
D :  well if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , press power again and use that as an enter um so you press power after you've um well I was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice .
A :  Then you'd have to have an off te off key .
B :  Okay , yep , mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  It's not getting a bit complicated ?
B :  Could granny do this , or are we just not aiming at granny ?
D :  Well
D :  Or y yeah . Or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . Yeah , I don't um I wish . Anyway , uh that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions
C :  Who's got an iPod then ?
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  people have made , what's most important . It's definitely channel , volume , power .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , things like screen settings and audio settings , I would generally
C :  do them on the actual television itself , like here you have a
D :  Exactly .
C :  you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . I I wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control , so
D :  Exactly .
D :  Yeah .
C :  um I would say that they are definitely less relevant .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay , well . Thanks for looking at that .
A :  So I guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . As you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . I just joined that set last week . Um first grandchild arrived . Um so are we agreed then of those things ? And let's go back to agenda and hook me up .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  We don't wanna outsmart
D :  Hmm .
D :  Congratulations .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh .
A :  Mm . This oughta be fun . It probably won't go the first time , it'll probably be like a g mess .
A :  Come on .
A :  Uh it lost it off here . Uh
D :  Oh you're fine .
D :  It's fine .
A :  No , it was up there , but I couldn't see it down here .
A :  Mm .
A :  This time it should be both .
A :  There we go .
B :  How do you do that ? How do you make it do both ?
A :  Um you have to keep doing the financi the the F_N_ and F_ eight to five minutes to finish , thank you a lot for telling me . Um right , we're ready to close . Um will be completed q questionnaire , um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um and I'll put some minutes of this meeting together . Um your individual assignments are for
B :  Ah okay , it toggles through , yeah .
D :  I think you have to cycle through .
B :  Yeah .
A :  um Kate to do the components , for
A :  you , Steph , to do the user interface and for you the trend-watching . Um and each of us will get help from our coach . Are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch ? Okay . Then that's the end of this meeting . And I hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end . Okay ?
C :  Yes .
B :  Sounds good .
B :  Okay .
C :  We didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though .
A :  Well I think I went over the functions and wrote them down and marked them . Um that's what I went over and nobody was objecting to them .
C :  Alright , well that's fine then .
D :  Okay .
D :  Um and you'd mentioned I I was just gonna say , could you reiterate the new project requirements , because it they were it has to be for a T_V_ , just to keep myself
A :  Okay .
A :  Um the teletext is outdated , the internet is important , it's only to be for a T_V_ and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan um which I think is more in the user uh range , with Steph .
B :  So we're still in meeting , aren't we ?
D :  Yeah , I think I've
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
C :  Sorry , what what actually are these is that the yellow and black ?
A :  It doesn't tell me .
D :  Mm .
C :  From their I'll just use it from their website .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay ?
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Right . Thank you .
A :  Right uh .
A :  So um .
A :  So where's the PowerPoint presentation ?
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Microsoft PowerPoint , right .
A :  Right , okay . So .
A :  Right .
A :  Okay , so we've got uh
A :  so we've got new project requirements . Um .
A :  So basically we've got three things , and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options . Um .
A :  Three presentations .
B :  We have a I guess we have a presentation each , 'cause I've got one . Um .
A :  I see , right . That's nice to know , one from each of you . Um new project requirements . Um so do we want to do the presentation first , or do we want to um
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I've got one too .
A :  W I I got um or or three things basically , um relating to the remote being only for T_V_ . We discussed that last time and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway . So in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled in a sense . Um we've got uh teletext outdated . Um did you get any information on that ? Right and the corporate image was the uh final thing . So I I got that in email form . Um . Right okay . So
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Uh we didn't , no .
C :  No .
B :  I d I didn't personally .
D :  Hmm .
A :  I guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations . So we'll start with yourself on the basis that uh
B :  Okay that's fine .
B :  I'll just um I'll grab the wire out the back of this one .
A :  Sorry , yep .
A :  Oh .
C :  What is it ?
B :  I'm not quite sure how it
C :  I think you've got to do um control F_ eight .
B :  Control
B :  Doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment .
C :  Shift F_ eight .
B :  Alt function F_ eight .
B :  Again not doing anything .
D :  There's usually a little thing in the top right for the Oh hang on , it's just coming on .
C :  Ah there , it's doing something .
B :  Oh .
B :  pressed about five times now .
B :  Okay , that's me .
B :  Okay , um I have to go again .
A :  it going ?
B :  Hopefully that should be it this time .
B :  Okay , I think we're there . That's good .
B :  Okay , um
B :  Okay I'm gonna be looking at the working design . Um of the of the remote control . Um I've just got three sections , first is the research I made on the on the remote control itself um . And then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote .
B :  Um so having researched the existing models within the market , um I found my research off the internet . Um I've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . And then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do and how it connects with the television . Um the basic components are an energy source which I guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply .
B :  Whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary . We then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . Um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . Um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . And then the sender , which um
A :  Okay .
B :  is usually , I've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . Um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system but is not actually part of the remote itself , because that's obviously found in the television . . Um I'm gonna have to actually draw on the board because uh it was a little tricky on PowerPoint to get this working , so .
B :  I'll just go through there .
B :  S um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ? Oh I'll j
A :  Uh there's the rubber on the right , I think . it's magic .
C :  I think it's that little
B :  Oh I see . Oh okay . I'll get rid of the bear
B :  Okay that's great .
B :  Okay , so we start off with a um battery suppl Uh no , a power supply which we'd probably get it's probably gonna be the battery . Um
B :  we then have
B :  a particular button , which may be that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons . Um but this is how the basic system works . Um that sends after you press that that sends the message to
B :  the chip , which um then sends
B :  It sort of interprets which button you've pressed and then sends the appropriate message to the sender .
B :  Um .
B :  So that's . That's the remote in itself , that's the components of the remote and how they work together . So this is the uh user
B :  interface .
B :  Um this is the chip itself , which then , and that's the that's the infra-red
B :  sender . And then on the separate thing we have on the
B :  on the television
B :  we have a
B :  a receiver .
B :  And the sender sends a message to the receiver . 'Kay .
A :  So the the top bit's the power source , yes ? .
B :  Ah yes , that's the power source . Um .
B :  going on to personal preferences , I've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , just because of the size . You don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote . Um and then the sender , and infra-red um has been used quite successfully . If the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well . You don't have to be point directly at the television itself . Um
A :  So the battery is the in the sender .
B :  Yes .
B :  'Kay and that's it for the moment .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . So , now more design .
C :  Right .
C :  Thank you .
C :  Mine's not quite as complicated as all that .
A :  That's what we like to hear .
C :  Did I press function ? Yeah .
A :  Is it control function ei Oh , th there you go .
C :  Oh .
C :  Um . Okay so I'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . I'm Louisa , the User Interface Designer , as you know . Um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . Um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that .
C :  Um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . Um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . Um here are two example remotes . Um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , so I think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . Uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . Um whereas the right remote is much simpler , it looks much more user friendly .
C :  Um so my personal preference would be the right remote . So , it's got nice big buttons , it's got a very limited number of buttons . Um they're nice , kinda clearly labelled . Um I like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . So it's very very user friendly , and it's got a little splash of colour . Could maybe do with some more colour . Um .
A :  Well there's a couple of things there . Um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . So basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product .
C :  Hmm . Do we get to see that ? Will you be presenting that in a bit ?
A :  I haven't as yet , no . But uh I got uh I got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . So uh I'm guessing that uh uh I notice on the bottom there it's got uh
A :  what's that ? A_P_O_G_E_E_ that might be the corporate colour scheme , although the only the only colour I can see in that is the red .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , because that seems to be for a video as well . So we could dispense with that little bit as well and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . Possibly ?
C :  What do you mean by the circular section ? Like all of that bottom bit ?
B :  J yeah yeah yeah j yeah just this little bit is that I think that's still um a video remote part , so maybe we could get rid of that as well .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . And I don't really think that you need nine numbers . I mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? I think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough .
A :  Well b uh w
A :  Well th the on the Well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . But but
C :  Like how often do you hit nine ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It's just people are used to seeing that , so if we didn't have them then they might think it's
A :  But , well possibly but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , but uh I mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? I would have thought that uh
A :  it's forever expanding and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the B_B_C_ have come up with a further six and uh there's uh I don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh Sky and various other um various others . So I would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather Okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , but presumably it'll take a second 'cause you have to be able to stop it . Maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels that w and then you could dispense with more otherwise . Y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Um some remotes have kind of favourite options where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , I s I suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want and that would cut down your time . Anyway .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm . Um . But I think a lot of um like Cable and Sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . Like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers
B :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Whatever . Okay . Okay . Limit the number of buttons , user friendly .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But I suppose nine's not really excessive . I suppose it does make a good pattern .
B :  I suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . So with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well that's true , yeah , you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , that that makes sense .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . 'Cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Does .
A :  So w so what was the circular thing that you were
C :  Okay .
C :  Um I think that's just for a video , so we wouldn't need any of that at all .
B :  So we could get it down to what ?
A :  If it's just for T_V_ , which is what it is at the moment .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So we get to How many buttons have we got ? We've just got ten , eleven twelve th We got fourteen that we need . I guess .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um which isn't really too many . That'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well we've we've got um that it's remote for T_V_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations . I'm I don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing , or was I meant to give you that information ?
B :  'Kay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I'm not sure . I had I've had some market information , but not from the company , no .
A :  Right .
A :  Right , okay , so basically time to market seems to be important , therefore speed of delivery . We've only got about another four hours left .
B :  'Kay .
C :  Okay , so is everyone happy with that ?
B :  Ah yes yes , that seems good .
D :  Okay .
C :  Right well that's the end of my presentation .
D :  'Kay .
D :  I'm gonna pull this off .
B :  I think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up .
A :  Yeah , I think she said twenty seconds to um
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  Okay .
B :  I'm sure we'll have by the end of today .
D :  I'll give it another go .
D :  Yeah , there we go .
D :  Right , we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . And first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the T_V_
D :  and um how do people use it ? We asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . Um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , and what improvements would would they like to remote control . And we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers .
D :  And three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control
D :  And that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all . People concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . Uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . And young people were quite receptive to this , but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older ,
D :  people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . There's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . Um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . And the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . Okay , so
D :  My personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech A design which looks high-tech , basically . Um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as Louisa said . Um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an L_C_D_ menu for other functions on the remote control . That's worth thinking about . Um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , because um sort of young people are
D :  perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design .
D :  That that might be the market that we're we're looking for .
D :  And we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels . 'Cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . Okay um , and that's the end of the slide show . That's it . Cool .
B :  Mm .
C :  Do a lot of um
A :  What was that last wee bit there ? Speech recognition , right okay . But that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't .
D :  Um about speech recognition ? Yeah .
D :  Youn young people pref Yeah , they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so .
B :  No what I maybe think is um
B :  it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Well that's right .
B :  for the speech recognition . Um .
D :  Yeah .
B :  And possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have You know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . Maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . So you can press a button which is always kept in one place and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but
B :  That is true , yes .
B :  Hmm .
C :  There's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at , I can't remember , and then they whistle back , or something like that . That'd probably be really simple , they're cheap .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Sounds reasonable .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . So
B :  So I guess it'd be something we could like attach to the or like the same technology could be put inside the
A :  Well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here I am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . But if you
B :  inside the remote .
A :  I know . Um I was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever .
A :  You'd want to try and av just have the one product that if
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Um I dunno um talking about vo I mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way because it'll recognise the voice and you can give it a command , a set command whatever that happened to be . But you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then
D :  Yeah .
B :  you could have an option to turn it off . Or
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Perhaps , um .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So that would solve the problems with the T_V_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels .
A :  Mm . So uh Any sugges Well , any conclusions ?
D :  Um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? Considering
A :  Well if it does then we can't . It's that simple , because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  from and email uh that was sent to me whereby we had The design logo was one , which we've already mentioned . We've got um the remote was only for the television and not for because that would make it too complex and we have to get it market quickly . And the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  So that means that uh so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project . So we're being focused effectively directly at a television and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . So anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick because time to market is is critical . S
B :  'Kay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
B :  Has to be simple enough to
B :  I suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . Um .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It would . But probably quick and simple is primary rather than
B :  'Kay .
A :  added extras . Added extras would be nice , but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window , which effectively now is sort of four hours . So and if and we've gotta get to the end . Uh d d I think I think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end and then get to the end with um added extras if possible .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . Right okay , uh so I need to
D :  So
A :  Right . So I don't know how long we have left of our uh time . But we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions
D :  About five minutes .
A :  and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting
A :  each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . We'll also know w when the next meeting is I um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task . And then we can report back at the next meeting and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed . Does that make reasonable sense ? So we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing .
B :  Yes .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes that seems right .
D :  Okay , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Do it via the email so that rather than coming you know If you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . Come along with it in the next meeting , we can discuss it then and take whatever action is appropriate . But if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know 'cause that might have an impact on their uh on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting . Okay .
D :  Okay . Yep .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right , is there
D :  So do we need to decide on the functions now ? S
A :  I would guess so .
C :  Well I think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function . 'Cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah and
D :  Yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so .
A :  Yep .
D :  I don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I don't really know about the voice recognition thing .
A :  I w well uh i
B :  Maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , and if something comes back
A :  Something simple . Uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short , you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product , something that's quick and simple . So , sounds good .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . And that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either , 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology .
A :  Well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be On the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , now something that doesn't like whis uh Well I I I don't know . Well If you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option , but if I would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , so uh so clap option .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  No not everyone can whistle , can they , though ?
D :  No , clapping , I think clapping , yeah . Yeah .
B :  I'd go more Yeah , f more for clap .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  'Kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ?
A :  Uh . Ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying , that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext , so so take out teletext .
C :  Is that one of the
C :  Hmm .
D :  Taking out teletext , okay .
B :  Did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together .
C :  Right .
C :  Yeah , I think so , so zero to nine .
D :  Mm .
D :  I think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , so you can press any two and it'll sort of put them together .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , ten numbers and then some kind of device to allow uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  I'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Or multiple digits .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Did we decide anything about um the other functions ? As in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? You had an had an idea about the menu ?
D :  Uh we could possibly put an L_ a sort of a L_C_D_ menu in , but that again is probably an expense that
B :  But just thinking um people probably I mean you don't have you only have to probably tune in the T_V_ once , but you have to be able to tune it that once . So and if finally the T_V_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . You can't really avoid that . Except the new digital markets which do it by themselves .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  No .
A :  But the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic and if it is at the moment , that's fine . But at the moment it's not , so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , 'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances and the idea is to have an international market which is And it's also m it's the the product we've got is something that's at the I would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , so we're not really going for something that's uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  So that'll be in
B :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I s I suppose um
A :  terribly high-tech .
D :  if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote 'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so . I mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in .
A :  Possibly .
A :  That's right .
B :  Yeah . So how would this menu function work ? Would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that would be a good idea , yeah .
C :  Yeah , like the volume or something .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . My dad was watching a film the other week and it was too dark , so I had to go through it and turn the brightness up .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  we're gonna have the the individual numbers and then a menu function and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it , to guide Presu uh I think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Uh
D :  I'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . So maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , so you're basically pressing
B :  Right , okay um .
B :  that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so .
D :  Right .
A :  Okay , well .
D :  Okay .
C :  Well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ? So you don't use it that much , you don't have to see it all the time . But it's all there if you need it .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So y Ah That's a very good idea . So you keep um Right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so I've been told . I don't know if you've got the same . Okay . So so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back .
B :  That is that is a good idea actually . Sor sort of a second .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Like a hidden panel .
B :  Okay .
B :  Uh not quite , but I guess .
B :  Keep the other buttons but hide them away .
C :  Hmm . And that'll be better for the older generation as well 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu , but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly .
A :  Ah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . So we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , I guess .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That's right .
D :  Yeah .
A :  data functions hidden at back . Can bring out when needed .
D :  So th the
D :  The detailed ones would be sort of brightness , uh sorta
C :  Yeah .
A :  That's right so we're dis So you've got which ones are gonna be on the front and which ones are gonna be on the back . We have to decide .
B :  So sh
B :  Should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I guess so .
B :  So on the
A :  So on front ,
B :  about the number .
A :  numbers ,
B :  Um the volume up and down .
C :  And the volume ?
A :  volume .
B :  Shall we have a mute button as well ?
C :  Um .
A :  Sorry ?
B :  A mute button as well .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah . Or
C :  Yeah I think they're handy .
D :  Mm-hmm . And probably a power one as well . Dunno .
C :  I know it's probably like um
C :  not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity . Have you seen the adverts ? Like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste . If you leave your telly on standby it powers Blackpool for a certain amount of time . Like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But then they might not buy it if they haven't got one . 'Cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here . Uh-oh danger sign .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ?
B :  We can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by .
B :  I think you probably should .
C :  Yeah , but a little bit smaller . Compromise .
D :  Okay .
A :  Well .
B :  Um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ?
D :  Um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so .
B :  Okay , so we'll have um
C :  Right .
B :  So we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ?
D :  Um .
A :  Channel up and down . What else have we got ? What was that , sixteen ?
D :  Numbers is ten , volume is
D :  twelve , th Yeah si One up , one down .
A :  Volume button . How many volumes ?
A :  Right okay .
C :  On mute .
D :  And a mute , yeah . That's sixteen isn't it , yeah .
B :  Is there anything else ? Um .
D :  I don't think so , no .
A :  Power button , stand-by , channel , up and down . So is that it ?
C :  so .
A :  Okay . That's sixteen buttons , you reckon . And then at the back ?
D :  You've got
D :  brightness and contrast .
C :  And then
B :  Maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be .
A :  Okay . So on the back
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  it'll have brightness , contrast , anything else ? You're also gonna have the channel tuner , as it were .
C :  Uh there's audio functions .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So tuner up and down , I guess .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Tuner , would that have up and down ? .
B :  Um up Tune one way , tune the o I I dunno I dunno possibly .
C :  I think they normally do .
A :  okay . Okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And then maybe sort of an enter button for
D :  sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . So you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah .
B :  Oh yeah and th and a enter button just to select . Yeah , okay .
B :  Um I guess we're keeping s it simple . We don't really need any other audio funct uh functions because it's just volume up , volume down .
A :  Um up volume , yeah , I would have thought so .
B :  Um .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So I think um
C :  there's quite a lot of like Dolby surround studio , surround sort of things .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Um maybe for the younger market .
B :  Do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , or do you have to do it via the remote ?
C :  Um I think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel .
B :  Yeah I suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Oh no , I mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them , like on the T_V_ remote . But I don't really know what they're for , I've never used them . I just know they're something to do with Dolby .
B :  Oh , okay .
B :  Right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um .
B :  Maybe unless something comes up then we should I think
A :  Well you might get some research .
B :  Well shall we look into that and just get back together .
A :  Okay . Right so I'll do the minutes of uh this meeting . And we'll meet back at I'm not sure . Um forty minutes , I believe is the time .
D :  Okay .
C :  Right .
D :  Right .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Come on .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . That's okay . That's okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Am I starting now ?
A :  Anytime ? Oh sorry . 'Kay , um . Alright , welcome back fro to the second meeting . And um I hope you had a productive last thirty minutes . Um , and um , I'll be taking minutes on this one , and um Being hooked up to the PowerPoint for this meeting isn't very necessary for uh myself , because it'll be more about uh , what you guys are bringing to the meeting today . Um , so , the first presentation we'll be looking at is Poppy's presentation . And , um
A :  So , sorry ? So , um , take it away Poppy .
B :  Okay . Um , do I need to plugged in .
A :  It's , it's plugged in . So , um
C :  F_ eight , w . Function F_ eight .
B :  F_ okay . Function F_ eight . Sorry about this guys .
A :  No problem .
B :  'Kay . is on .
B :  Right .
B :  Okay . I will take this time just to apologise . I , I only , uh , received my emails later on . 'Cause I was too busy carried away doing my own thing , which is not obviously not a very good part of a team-working thing . But there we go . Um , so I was looking at how we're going to go about the working design , and what we actually need to do , and what the remote control needs to do . And it needs to um allow a person to have a portable desi device , so they can control the television from wherever they are . They don't need to actually manually touch the television set . So , it gives them much more flexibility , and allows them to be where they want to be .
A :  I'm sure it's fine .
B :  Um , from
B :  Uh , on a functional side of things , we found out that wh from our previous meeting , we decided that there're certain points that will make our product unique . Um , one is the visibility in the dark , which was um Genevieve's idea . So we need to think about how we could bring this in um technically . And we could use illuminated buttons , which we are all familiar with when we're using a mobile phone , or um something fam familiar . A automatically , um lights up at first touch . Or we could use fluorescent materials which would just um take in the light during the day , and then as soon as they go off they would glow in the dark .
B :  Um , also we could use um an alarm . So if we lost the um remote control , perhaps there could be a button on the television set itself , which you could press , and then an alarm from the handset would sound where it was , hopefully in the room . Maybe behind a cushion or somewhere . Um , so that would work . Um , oop . Go back there .
B :  Um , another thing I think we d missed out on on the last meeting was the fact that we should consider the environmental impact of our design . Um , from previous researches I've carried out on other projects , um we've learnt about smart materials where um um specific alloys of metals have a shape memory . So they can be heated and um and cooled , and they change the shape of um the metal . So , for example , a screw that's holding something together could expand and it would force all the components apart .
B :  So um , the benefits of this for our product would be that when it came to the end of its product life , if it was heated , um everything would spring apart . So , all the um individual components could be easily separated , and then some could be reused , some could be recycled , and I think that would be very important for products now . Especially 'cause there's much uh responsibility for all the um companies who are coming up with like new designs . 'Cause all , we all know that our resources are being limited , and we have to be very environmentally conscious .
A :  Right , um , one question . This , um , self-destructible uh metal , it allows for recycling materials ? So that , um , someone could have this product for as long as they felt that they wanted it , and then once they contribute it , then that company can break down the part , the parts better ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  And then
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah they would , um you would make the , the product as you normally would , apart from the , the bits that hold it all together would be made out of this shape-memory alloy . And that's the part that would um allow all the other parts to be separated at the end . I mean , the user would return the p product to the company , 'cause it's the product's responsibility to get rid of what they've made . Um , and then the company could then just use , make use of this shape-memory alloys to split up the components , and then either reuse some bits , and other bits which are obviously gonna wear out with time , or not usable , they might be like be able to put into scrap metal . Something like the case , if it's scratched or something , you would want to reuse it , but you might be able to melt it down and reuse it again somewhere else .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Would we be the company that would break down these , or uh metals ? Or would we contribute to another group ?
B :  You could we could probably empl em employ a , a side company or something to do that for us . But it would be our responsibility to get that done and to dispose of the products that we made . For a certain percentage at least . Not every , not a hundred percent of everything we produce , but
A :  Alright .
A :  Okay . This sounds like a really great idea . One thing we have to consider is our uh one hundred percent um turnover goal that we have for our financial sector . Um , so we'll have to investigate how much that will cost us , cost the company , um 'cause it sounds very labour-intensive . You would have to hire a number of people , and it might be more expensive .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well I the fact of the shape-memory alloys is that they , they don't need to be manually de um deconstructed . Like , you don't have to individually um unscrew all the screws . Because of this , their properties are smart material . All you need is just the heat , so they self-destruct themselves . So I suppose it does need like high contact , yeah , you know high uh quality machinery , and very specific machinery , but
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright . We'll still have to investigate the financial implications .
A :  Alright . I like the environmental approach . Um , we'll have to see if that can meet our financial goals as well .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Um also
B :  there is um components . This'll be how it uh will actually work . But I haven't put this plan together yet .
B :  There we go . Sorry , should I go back .
A :  I'm sorry , could you Those were um
B :  This would actually show the circuit diagram . Although I haven't come up with the final circuit yet . So I just put all those components in .
A :  Okay .
A :  So those are what , um , we'll c construct the remote . Those are all the
B :  Yeah . I it just shows what sort of energy source . It could be a battery , like rechargeable probably . Um , an' yeah , well how the infrared will actually be sent through the chip to be received by the chip on the television set itself . Okay ?
A :  Alright . Great .
B :  So , now is it F_ eight again to escape ? Or escape ?
B :  There we go .
B :  Okay .
A :  Alright . Thank you very much .
B :  Thank you .
A :  And , um , the next presenter will be Tara .
B :  There you go Tara .
C :  Thanks .
C :  Can you see ?
D :  Oh ,
C :  Do you think
C :  Is it uh , function eight yeah ?
B :  Function F_ eight . The one at the top .
D :  Function F_ eight .
A :  Yeah . Function F_ eight . Sorry .
C :  Oh right . Okay .
D :  That looks right .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  I'm the User um
C :  User Interface Designer . Uh , the technical functions design of the apparatus is the effect the apparatus should have . Um , in this case it's the function of the remote control , which is to send messages to the television , television set . By taking inspiration from other similar designs , we'll try and come up with an original trendy remote control , which is sellable international . There're two functional design options . A multifunctional remote control , which can be used for several entertainment devices . And a single function remote control , used specifically for the television .
D :  I'm sorry , what was that last one . Multifunctional and
C :  Sorry . Um , a single function just for the television itself .
D :  Ch Oh , I see .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Um , multifunctional controls can be difficult to use , as the multitude of buttons can be confusing .
C :  A single function remote control is simpler to use , but it means you have to have other remote controls for your other entertainment devices .
D :  'Kay .
C :  Um , I think that a single function remote control would be preferable , because it's easier to use . It'd be more compatible with a range of television sets , making it more internationally sellable .
C :  Um , it will make an original design more obtainable , as we have less functional necessities to include in the design . And it would be more profitable as it would be more simplistic . And less functions would have to be included .
C :  So it would be cheaper to make . And probably more sellable just because it's more compatible with a r a wider range of devices .
C :  Does anyone have any questions ?
D :  So as far as we know , um , a single function television remote control is us usable internationally ?
C :  Well , it's just that , when we're creating it , we're , we have to make it um compatible with different brands of devices . And it would be easier to make it compatible with just different brands of television devices rather than other ent , yeah , other entertainment devices .
D :  Right .
D :  D_V_D_s and V_C_R_ ? Okay .
A :  Right .
A :  Does everyone agree with this ? Does anyone object and , and find the multifunctional might be a better way to go ?
B :  Um , I was just wondering about the , what , what Genevieve said before , about having like some hidden controls like having the outer casing . And that would probably , um , I d , well well what you said before about it being a more profitable simplistic design . I suppose having that would complicate it a lot more . And limit the design . Do you think ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think I agree with the single design thing for now , because we're trying to do so much , that if we're trying to make a unique , user-friendly , dadada , and it's also multi also multifunctional , um , we're gonna go over budget for one thing . So
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . That's true . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And with this we'll have more room in the budget probably to make a more original design . We'll have more money to go into the design side of it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  Alright . Sounds great .
D :  Mm , 'kay .
A :  Alright , well , um , are you ready for your presentation Genevieve ?
D :  Yes I am .
A :  Fabulous . Except you're not hooked up to the Great .
D :  Oh , I'm not hooked up , but other than that , completely ready .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Oh . I just lost my microphone .
A :  No problem , we can
D :  Just a moment . Okay . So I'll be discussing the functional requirements of this remote control . Um , and I'll give you a little briefing on what that means exactly . Um , if you all remember from the email we got before our very first uh kick-off meeting , with the coffee machine ? The functional requirements of that was to produce hot coffee quickly . Um , so what I'll be talking about now is the equivalent for a remote control . Um , so basically what needs and desires are to be fulfilled . Um , I've done some marketing research , a lot of interviews with remote control users , um , and some internet research . And I'll show you my findings .
D :  Oh , and firstly I wanted to remind you about our company motto and purpose . So we believe in providing international market with fashionable products . Um , hence our motto , we put the fashion in electronics . So I think that should be our priority here . Um , and we should also be looking to trends in clothing and interior design . Not just in electronic fashion . So that it's something that fits in the household .
A :  I'm sorry , what was that last thing that you just said ?
D :  Um , we should be looking towards trends in both clothing and interior design . Any trends that are going on in , in the public , even media , you know who's famous , what T_V_ shows are being watched , um , to influence our remote control .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , so the findings . Um , seventy five percent of users of remote controls find them ugly . Which is a , quite a significant number . Um , the other twenty five percent didn't specify if they love them or found them , you know , neutral . Eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . Current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .
A :  I'm sorry , that eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . You mean that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control ?
D :  Yeah , they're willing , they're willing to spend money on a remote control with personality . As opposed to your basic , you know , oval black , all same size button remote control . Um , so it is something that people care about . It's not , it's not ignored in the household . Um , seventy five percent of remote control users said that they zap a lot . Zapping meaning they go through channels a lot . They're you know thumb-masters . Um , and fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . That A very small amount . Thought that was interesting .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright , so it might be very appealing if , um , we have very concise buttons . And another thing with um lots of surfing , we'd probably have to work on something that could be um a lot more durable , because I find with um channel-changers that , um , a lot of the numbers get rubbed down if they're printed on the button .
B :  Mm .
B :  the single function . Yeah .
D :  Yes .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah that's a good point .
D :  And actually to go with that , I'm gonna give you some statistics on the uh relevancy of the buttons , how much they're used . And uh how important the uh users find them . So the power button , obviously , in an hour is only used once . Hopefully the person's not turning on and off the T_V_ . Um , but the relevance of that button is nine out of ten . So people wanna be able to turn on the T_V_ with the remote control . Um , as opposed to standing up and turning on the television set .
D :  Channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times on average per hour . That's a huge amount . This is the most important button . Um , so obviously when commercials come on they're changing it , so as you said we want a durable button that's not gonna run down . Relevance of that button , our users found was uh ten , ten out of ten . Uh , ditto for volume selection , so ten out of ten . And it's used on average four times an hour . Not as much as channel selection , but still significant .
D :  Um , audio settings is used on average zero point eight times an hour . Relevance is two . Screen settings , which means brightness , colour etcetera , zero point five times an hour . Um , and relevance of one point five . We're getting to specific statistics here . Teletext , um , now I'm not too clear on what that is . I don't know if you can help me . Flipping pages .
C :  It's um
D :  Is that
B :  It's like the news . Or like information .
C :  It has T_V_ has like information , it has information on holidays , the news , entertainment . No , li Yeah .
B :  The and what's on .
A :  Yeah . It's um No it's a button that you press , and then you , uh , like a menu pops up . I haven't used it before but
D :  So like a running banner , underneath
C :  Yeah .
D :  Oh .
C :  And you have page numbers like for the menu , and you press the page numbers with your remote , and it , it'll come up .
B :  It's like
B :  It's like very basic internet . Sort of , um
D :  Okay .
C :  Very basic internet , yeah . But you have Yeah . But you have no interaction back with it , you know . Like the internet you can send emails and You've no interaction .
D :  Okay . Like tells you the weather , and Okay .
B :  Yeah , it's just information that um , like television timetables , what's on , what's on now , what's on next , on every channel , and
D :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright . Well I guess I'm not with it , because I wasn't But it's , it's being used fourteen times an hour . Um , and has a r a high relevance of six point five . So it looks like something that we're gonna want to do some research on and include on our remote control . Um , channel settings . Zero point zero one times an hour . Relevance of three . Channel settings .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , probably just tuning in the channels , would it be ? Tuning them in at the very start . You know if you get a new T_V_ set , you tune in all the channels , do you th do you think ? Yeah . Yeah .
D :  P Sorry . Changing the channels ?
D :  Oh , okay .
B :  To get the right reception and picture , I suppose .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  Mm .
D :  Um , so it's not used very often , but people still find it relevant . Okay .
D :  Um , biggest frustrations of uh the people that we interviewed . Remote controls are often lost somewhere . So that was already discussed by Poppy . How we could have a , an alarm system so that people can find it . Um , takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . So it should be very user-friendly , you know . People know what to do very quickly . Um , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ .
D : 
B :  Repetitive strain injury .
C :  Repeti Uh .
D :  Ah . Is that what it is ? People with arthritis and such ?
B :  I think .
A :  That's rather sad .
C : 
D :  Um , maybe our
B :  Oh , I'm guessing that's what it is . I'm not
C :  Yeah , yeah . I think it is .
D :  designers can look into that . Um , buttons that don't require , you know , very firm pushing , if they respond . But we'll have to also avoid , you know , buttons responding to the slightest touch as well . That's a problem .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . It is .
D :  Okay . Did you guys uh get that one down ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
D :  Um okay , here's some ideas for you . A large percentage of the public would pay for voice recognition on the remote controls . So I'll show you some numbers here .
D :  Um , so the youngest age group , fifteen to twenty five . Ninety one point two percent said that they would pay extra money to have voice recogni voice recognition included on their remote control . Um , and you can see that number decreases a bit with ol s Interestingly enough , twenty five to thirty five is the lowest amount .
D :  Um , that would , are willing to pay extra . So I guess we're gonna have to figure out what age group we're , we're targeting , and if and if voice recognition is something we wanna look into . And if we have the budget for it . Um , if we are targeting young adults , it looks like something that would pay off . Seeing as ninety percent , over ninety percent would pay for it .
A :  I agree with um if we're targeting young adults then it would be something we should look into . Um , financially and and functionally . Um , and especially if we are um trying to be trendy , go with fashions , things like that . Um , ages like from thirty five to sixty five which show lower numbers probably won't be as concerned .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
D :  So that , that's a whole other field of research . I don't know if it'd be , if we'd still have a remote , or if you're talking to your television and saying change channel . Um and depending on how many members you have in households . So it m it may be too complicated for us , but it's something to keep in mind anyway .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . And something that might further complicate it is that the T_V_ makes noise itself . Wonder if it would have
D :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And if there was conversation in the room at the same time , although in theory it doesn't tend to be when you're watching television , but could be very difficult to get the specific uh design . Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . If we're looking for a simplistic design , if We need to decide if that is our um intention is , is a simplistic design . Um , because if , if it is then I think voice , um voice-activated
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
D :  It looks like
A :  Yeah , and that would sort of negate the whole remote control thing , because if people can activate the television with their voice then they won't be using a , they won't be talking into a remote , I'm sure .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  It'd be like the ultimate remote .
D :  Um okay . And th the last thing here was a , an L_C_D_ screen . So , I mean voice recognition might be a little too extreme for us . Not practical . Um an L_C_D_ screen though might be something that , you know , you can shift through pages kind of li the way this PowerPoint is working . So that you don't have so many buttons to deal with .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Um , I don't know what an L_C_D_ screen is .
D :  Oh sorry , just , just a screen , like a computer screen . S Or like um
C :  Mobile phone . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Or Like an alarm clock . You'd have an L_C_D_ versus just a , a normal clock .
B :  Mm .
B :  What , what would appear on the screen ?
A :  I have no idea still . I'm sorry .
D :  Oh just like an electronic screen . As opposed to just buttons . There would be like a little , like on Yeah . Like on the top of a cellphone , the the little L_C_D_ screen . Um , now that's , I , I dunno exactly what exactly we'd put on there . I guess the channel that you're on , the v the volume setting .
A :  Oh , on the remote . Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Could it it It would be good if it had the actual programme that was on , and what was next . But that would probably be
B :  Like linked in with the teletext , or sort of like an
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . That would be good , yeah .
B :  teletext at your fingers , without having to access that through the television .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Might be quite expensive to do that though .
B :  Mm , Yeah .
B :  Could be .
D :  Well I guess that's something we can all take back to our respective research . Um , and finally , whoops , my personal preferences and thoughts . Um , I think our priority really should be unique design . Um , we want something that people want in their home . Every remote control looks the same , so uh in my opinion it should be , um , user-friendly and unique .
A :  Right .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So the other stuff might be a little too , a little too gadgety for some people . Um , I th myself , voice recognition kind of scares me off . So if we're , if we're aiming to make this an international university , universally accepted product Um , and for all , the other thing is like age market . I mean if we wanted to concentrate on fifteen to twenty five years olds , we could go for the fancy stuff . But if we wanna make fifty million , and and have everyone want this remote control , we should maybe
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  stick to the basics .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And we should keep in mind that fifteen to twenty five year olds might not have twenty five Euros to spend on a remote control . Like their priorities might not be a fancy remote control , when they're just starting out and , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Right . And we have to keep in mind the , the reliability of our research . I mean , you know , a sixteen year old boy would say , yeah I'd pay extra for voice recognition , until they realise that's three months allowance . Um , so I I think , I think the older generations we should be catering to a bit more .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Early twenties , that's the kind of age group . Twenties .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And if one of the largest , uh , or most complained about thing is that it takes so long to get to know how to use a remote control , I'm sure that something like an L_C_D_ screen or remote control would be just furthering that problem .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Complicated jus complicating things even fo Mm . Okay .
D :  Yep .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright .
D :  Okay . That's it for the market research .
A :  Okay . Before we go into uh more discussion on we want this design to look like , I've received some information from the management that will affect some of our decisions . Um , for one thing , because Having controls with D_V_D_ , V_C_R_ , that sort of thing , would really complicate the design of the remote control . Um , we've decided not to include them and make it a specific , just a specific television um function . Which is good as , as we've sort of decided that we would like to go with that anyway . Um , for many reasons . So um we have that decision sort of made for us . Another thing that might um affect other decisions is that um the management feels that teletext is outdated , because more people are using the internet now . And so uh we won't concern ourselves with um navigating the teletext option . Yep .
B :  Can I just interrupt ?
B :  Would you like to plug in your Have you got a PowerPoint or not ? Okay . Thanks .
D :  Yeah . Maybe we can do the
A :  Okay , sure .
A :  Yeah I do . I'm looking at looking at it right now .
D :  There you go .
A :  thank you .
D :  Oh , come back screen .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Were they , was the management suggesting use of the internet rather than teletext , or just avoiding both altogether ?
A :  Um , well , I mean we don't have the resources or or possibility of using the internet with the remote control , but um they were just pretty much saying that the teletext would not be used .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  Alright , and another thing . This is for the design , the design of the product is that um we wanna create , um
A :  more of a sense that people know that this is from our company . So , um , all the remote controls must have our um We'll incorporate our logo and colour in in some way . So , um , perhaps um our logo on the bottom , or wherever you feel like it would look good . Um , it doesn't have to be the colour of our um of our company but , another thing is that , um
B :  Right .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Just
A :  we need to , we probably would have to have that colour and , and logo decided upon . Um , I'm assuming that we already have one , but for the purposes of this meeting I , I wasn't offered a , like a type of logo or colour , so if that could be um somewhere on the design so that we can be recognisable .
B :  Okay . Work on that .
D :  It's probably R_ R_R_ in yellow .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  The little R_ R_ yellow thing ? Okay . Real Reaction ?
D :  Yeah , I think .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Um , yes , those are the changes . Um , so , now we need to discuss , um
A :  and come to a decision on our remote control functions , of , of how this is going to be . I'm just going to look at my notes for a second . Um , we have to decide on a target group and the functions of the remote control . So , um , we already know that it'll just be for the television . It'll It won't have teletext . But um , you know , we could discuss um those other options that you brought up , Genevieve .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay , so I Are we going to write off the L_C_D_ option ? Yeah ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Is that how most people feel about that ? Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . So no L_C_D_ , no teletext , and no voice recognition .
C :  I think it would be annoying though if I don't use teletext that much , but if it was on your T_V_ , you'd want to be able to use it , if
A :  Yeah , but another thing is that if we're reaching an international crowd , um , I know for one that in North America there is no such thing as teletext , so it'd be really superfluous .
C :  You'd Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Never heard of it .
C :  So is it just Okay . Alright . Right .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I don't know about other countries besides the U_K_ . Do you know if anywhere else has it ?
C :  I don't know .
B :  I don't know . More research required , I think . But if Was it a management decision that we're having Okay . So
C :  I don't know .
A :  Alright .
A :  It was a management decision , so it's , it's pretty much out of our hands at this point .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay then .
A :  'Kay .
A :  So , I guess we're looking at something rather simple .
D :  Um , well I guess , just from my findings it looks like we wanna minimise buttons .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Um .
B :  Minimal
D :  And the What was the word they used ? F findability is important .
A :  Yeah . I think we should definitely go ahead with the alarm system idea that you had . 'Cause I'm sure that could be inex inexpensive because we could use the same kind of infrared
B :  Yeah okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . The same signalling . I mean
A :  the same signal through that and it could just like make a little beeping noise . It's not that expensive to do .
B :  Or vibrate just the same as a mobile phone . Like you just a , a buzz or something . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Okay . I like that idea .
C :  Would you be able to , um , put the little device anywhere ? 'Cause uh isn't our remote control for
C :  all T_V_s , so
C :  you'd ha
B :  If Do you mean the the link between the Well , if the button was actually on
C :  Yeah , with the button that you pressed . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . The button Oh .
B :  Oh , yeah .
C :  C 'cause then it would only be a applicable to one T_V_ set , so it would need to be something that you could stick somewhere , or something .
A :  Minor detail there .
B :  Maybe Yeah , yeah . Maybe something adhesive that you could like stick onto the back of any set that would be um yeah not very obtrusive . Obviously something small that's Yeah , that's a good point .
A :  Yeah , it would have t
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Then it wouldn't , it probably wouldn't be able to use It would be able to use the same reception on the remote c control I guess , but the actual device would have to have its own infrared signaller . Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Would it need a battery then ?
A :  Maybe , um
B :  Pr probably . Unless it could be Okay . Um , unless some way , it could have some universal connection to like the socket , the same socket that the T_V_'s supplied from . I mean the power for the T_V_ . So , mm , more research into that one . Yeah .
A :  Probably , I mean . That's your department you'll have to sort that out .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , you'll have to Yeah , you'll have to investi Do some research on that , alright ? Great . Um , alright , and I'm sure that , um
D :  Mm .
A :  um , the glow-in-the-dark , fluorescent , whatever , system , um is a go ahead . Is everyone interested in that ?
D :  On the buttons ?
C :  I I like the light up suggestion . I think that would be better . 'Cause you know the way fluorescent lights lose their brightness after certain time , so
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  it doesn't It could it could be a tactile thing as well . Um right , if w if we're minimising buttons , we might be able to make them actually larger . And there's something on it . S you know like up arrow down arrow for , for volume . Um , and I don't know what we could do for , for channels . S
C :  I would go for
B :  Like a raised
C :  Well just the numbers could be embossed , couldn't it ? Like raised .
D :  The numbers themselves . But then the like up button and down button for the channel , channel changing .
C :  Yeah . Could be raised .
C :  Just little arrows , that you could feel , maybe ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah
A :  Hmm .
D :  I just thought that it , it might be sucking more battery power , if there , if it is a light up . I'm not sure .
C :  Yeah .
B :  That's true . And also y , uh Heather you mentioned before , um like how it should be accessible to everybody . Um , so like big b um buttons , for people you are visually impaired . The glow-in-the-dark or light up won't make any difference anyway . So like you say tactile might be better , because it'd be more available to everybody .
A :  Yeah . But I mean
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That , I think that's good , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Could we somehow We could , may , possibly , sorry , incorporate them both so that the buttons could maybe be in the shape of the numbers themselves and be made out of some glow-in-the-dark material . 'Cause I d I don't think that glow-in-the-dark material , um , like the actual soft plastic , um , costs that much more than other colours .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  No , it's not these days . I mean , it's quite easily accessible .
C :  No , I wouldn't say so .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I guess the other option , referring to the battery thing is , you know how cellphones will t light up for fifteen seconds or something , when you're s and then it goes , so if , if you're like changing the volume during a movie . I know , I'm thinking of mostly when you're watching a movie you turn all the lights off right . And you don't want to turn on the lights , to turn it down , because there's suddenly an explosion , and it's gonna wake up the baby . Um , so if you touch the button , it kind of reactivates it . It lights up for
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  That's good Yeah that a good idea .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  That , yeah , that's a good idea .
D :  On self timer .
B :  So self-timed lighting .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Alright we have five minutes left
B :  Um , I
A :  um , for the meeting , but I think we should discuss this light subject a little bit more before we close . Um , what was I missed the last moment , reading that . What were you talking about with the lighting up buttons ?
D :  Oh , just if it was kinda the same way that a cell You know how a cellphone will light up for about ten , fifteen seconds when you touch a button , after having not touched it for a while . Um , if instead of a constant light up on the , on the remote control , if it lights up for ten seconds when it's touched again .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . So it could be any button that would be pressed .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , and you , you touch it and it just kind of lights up a bit , and it gives a faint glow . So if you have all the lights off in your living room , you'll , you'll temporarily see it . Because usually you're not fooling around for it for more than what ten seconds . So
B :  So , self-timed
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so That's probably feasible . So , do you think that we should do the lighting up thing , and the glow-in-the-dark thing , and the shape of the numbers ? Do we have to kind of decide what we're gonna do with this .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think the shape of the numbers is a really good idea . And I think that's un unique as well . I mean , I haven't seen that . And as you're saying like numbers can wear off if they're just sort of like painted on , you know printed .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . For visually impaired , yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , yeah . And it could , if it's that softer rubber material it'll be , maybe , um , uh , better for people with um els no what's it called , R_S_I_ , what was it that we were talking about ? Yeah . Yeah instead of like hard buttons . Okay . Um , did we want to go for the glow-in-the-dark look ? Or did we want to go for the lighting up instantly ? Like should we do both ? Or we can have one or the other ? Because it might , for , for our design purposes , I mean , the lighting up thing might be better because glow-in-the-dark material has a funny kinda colour . And it might not go with different like face plates that we might come up with .
B :  durable .
B :  Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Repetitive strain injury . Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh right , the
C :  Yeah .
C :  If
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I was gonna say ,
D :  Exactly . It the it might be perceived as tacky , glow-in-the-dark . It's kind of like Eighties neon-style . Um , whereas we're trying to be trendy and fashionable . So
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , and we could Yeah there are now like loads , or a huge range of different colours that it could light up in as well , which could like link in with the company colours . Like it could be blue or green or yellow , or like we've just limited t with the , just ordinary phosphorescent so
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right . Right .
A :  Alright . So we've decided on lighting up things .
C :  I was thinking though , if it was glow-in-the-dark , you could put the um Real Reaction symbol as glow-in-the-dark , and then it would be constantly advertised .
B :  Yeah . Every time the , that it lit up , you c that could light up as well . Or , or the , whate
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . But with the same thing , I mean . If you touch the button and then it could be , it could be lit up as well . Is Are you okay with that ? Okay . Cool . Um
D :  That's true .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . So I think that um
A :  that completes most of our um our more uh practical decisions . And now it's up to designing . And um making sure that this can be feasible . And do you have anything Do you have anything to say ?
B :  Is
D :  What um Oh sorry .
D :  Yeah well , I was just gonna throw out there the thought about um personalising the remote control . Um , it , you , 'cause you mentioned face plates . So I I dunno if there's something that
D :  diff , you know like five different face plates . I dunno if this will start making it more complicated , but it could increase the popularity of the , of the remote . Um
B :  Okay . Like you can have changeable um mobile covers or something . Yeah , or Okay .
C :  Oh yeah . Interchangeable thing ?
D :  Yeah ,
A :  Like an iPod or something ? Okay .
C :  That would be good . Yeah .
D :  Exactly , like an iPod . Exactly . Or , or like mobile ph . And I dunno if we'd want to go with like T_V_ show themes or something . Like a Bart Simpson faceplate . But
A :  Like a cellphone ? Yeah .
C :  Yeah , and then that would be uh more profitable like as a sideline to the remote as well . Y Could buy extra
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Accessories .
D :  Mm-hmm . Exactly . You could start out with three , and if , if we hit it big then we can add some on .
B :  Person
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Well , that's great .
C :  That's a good idea . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think that we should incorporate that .
B :  Interchangeable . Um , als
A :  'Cause that wouldn't be very expensive at all . You'd just get one mould ,
C :  No .
B :  Yeah . Interchan
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  throw some plastic in it , you know .
B :  And also possible I mean , uh , we could gain out of that by advertising certain T_V_ shows , or
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well , that might be com problematic with um copyright issues . So , if it takes off then we'll , we'll , we'll try that out .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah . But if we , there is Yeah . We could Um , the environmental factor , we didn't bring that up again .
C :  If w
A :  Right . We'll have to do more research . Like as of yet , that has nothing to do with , um , the way it'll look . Um , does it need to be reached a de Do we need to reach a decision on that right now ? Because we need to investigate the financial implications .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um , I've
B :  Okay . Let's
A :  Okay .
A :  Is it Does it need to be uh decided on now ? Or should we
B :  I think we could probably leave that 'til later on , then .
A :  Okay .
A :  Good . Alright then . Anyone else have anything more to say before we close ?
C :  No .
B :  No .
A :  Alright , well .
A :  Let's have lunch and we'll discuss this later . Alright ?
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Thank you .
A :  Oh .
A :  Okay .
D :  Hm .
A :  Thanks for coming to this meeting . S how we doing on our remote ? We have some we have some ideas and some uh
A :  ideas for what people want .
C :  Uh we yes s I've lo I've done the role that I was asked to do anyway . I think .
A :  Yeah . Alright let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . See if I can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better . Um I'll go over what we went over last time , which shouldn't take long .
A :  Then I believe each of you have a presentation . Um I've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , what they want . Um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , um and how it's going to do it hopefully .
A :  And uh then we'll have the closing . Um which we'll have forty minutes for . Uh let's see , the last meeting we went over um
A :  who was responsible for what . I'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . Um Corinne is our Marketing Expert . She's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants . Um Ryan is our User Interface Designer .
A :  And Manuel is the Industrial Designer . So you're gonna come up with the ideas Ryan , and you're gonna pick 'em apart . Um we decided our remote , uh we want it to be a universal remote uh that everyone would want .
A :  Um we want to be modern , um fun , different . Uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , so we gonna have that locator function . Um and we want to be different .
A :  Um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . Ball-shaped phone . The keyboard shape . Um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . Something we could use with one hand . Um and that was our last meeting .
A :  So um why don't um Do each of you have a presentation ?
D :  Yep .
A :  Okay . I'll hand it off to you and um
A :  Does anyone do you wanna go first ? So we can maybe see what uh what the people want .
D :  Sure .
D :  What was it ? Function ?
B :  Eight . F_ eight .
D :  F_ eight ?
D :  Well .
D :  How do I get it
C :  Slide show .
A :  To go to the next one ? Yeah you click on that guy . Yeah .
D :  Oh right right right .
D :  That one ? Okay .
D :  Alright . Well , this is my report , which is going to be based pretty much on a survey that I was sent . Oh gosh , I've no idea . G
C :  Just press the arrow keys I think . Usually goes to it .
D :  Okay . Sorry I actually need
D :  to see something else on my screen .
A :  Hit F_ eight again .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think .
D :  And then ? Again ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  You want it to be on both screens , or just just yours ?
D :  No I want something else on mine .
D :  Is that possible ?
A :  Yeah but I think you have to hit escape .
A :  And then you can
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay but now you don't have that .
A :  Oh hit F_ eight again .
D :  Sorry guys .
A :  I know . I did the same thing .
A :  And then it should come up
A :  here shortly .
A :  'Kay .
D :  So is there no way I can give you the slideshow and
A :  I think oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ? Mm . I'm not sure . You could maybe minimise that screen and then
D :  have something yeah . Yeah . Oh well .
D :  Yeah .
A :  have them both up at the same time I think .
D :  It's okay . Okay . Um so first of all , the method that I used was by doing some marketing research , by um doing research on some interviews that were conducted . And then some internet research .
D :  And I was sent a report that was I think there were a hundred remote users that they interviewed . And so I will show you some of the results from that , which I think will be helpful . Um okay here are some of the findings . They said that the users dislike the look and feel of their current remote controls . And seventy five percent of the users find their remote controls to be ugly . Which is a fairly significant number I would say .
D :  And eighty percent of the users would be willing to spend more money if they could get a remote that would look fancy . So I think that earlier we were onto something when we were talking about having it be a modern cool look , I think that's definitely important .
D :  Um they say that current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . Seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot . And if anyone could clarify what that means ? Zap , does that just mean like changing the channel ? Okay .
C :  Is is it j just just just using it yeah .
B :  Just jus yeah .
D :  Um and fifty percent of the users say that they're only using ten percent of the buttons on their remote control . And there was something else , they kept track of the frequency per hour in using certain buttons . And some of them it looks like barely need to be included at all . Of course channel selection is used the most frequently .
D :  And then teletext was the next . Volume and then power . And then audio settings and screen settings and channel settings were practically never used . So I think we could definitely eliminate or somehow combine a lot of the functions into one button .
D :  Um the biggest user frustrations , as we said fifty percent of people find that their remotes are lost somewhere , and so I think a tracking device of some sort would be a good idea . They said it take thirty four percent said it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote .
D :  And twenty six percent said that the controls are bad for R_S_I_ .
C :  A repetitive strain injury .
D :  What is it ?
C :  Just repetitive strain injury . I think . That's what I guess .
D :  Okay . Okay . And so bas okay . Um as far as speech recognition goes , um the younger group looks like they're all for it . From the fifteen to twenty five age group over ninety percent said they would pay more . And it kind of just went down incrementally . The groups at the older they get it looks like the less willing they are to pay , so maybe we could discuss this and think and decide if we think it's worth investing in this . At least if we're targeting the younger groups .
D :  And so in conclusion . Some things that I drew from this are that I think we were correct . We definitely need to focus on a new modern appearance , since so many people seem to be concerned about the ugliness of their remote control . Um a multifunctional remote could be a good thing to explore . So you only have one rather than five different remotes sitting all over your room .
D :  Uh we need to simplify the remote and reduce the number of buttons , get rid of the ones that don't seem to be serving much purpose . And then lastly I thought that maybe we could discuss the idea of speech recognition .
D :  And that's it .
A :  'Kay . Very nice . Now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , what we should focus on . Uh
A :  Wait can I look at that real quick ? .
D :  Oh yeah .
D :  Sorry did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ? 'Kay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Having just listened to what Corinne just said , I'll draw on some of the things as well . Some things that sort of relevant to what I wanna say .
C :  'Kay so I'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design .
C :  Um the method I used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control . And t s simplest approach that I came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . I mean that's an obvious thing to say , but it's not attached to the device that you want to control .
C :  Um I had some things sent to me . Not very much . To look at similar devices . Um defined in some them . And then the personal preferences that I will suggest . Um we discussed a universal one . Um like it's just been brought up again then . But I think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . I'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself ,
C :  but you have to i they're a nightmare to use . You have to set them , reset them to everything . Um and that would only add buttons . Whereas I think the aim is to take away buttons . So I think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for T_V_s . Um or maybe just one that you could we could design and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . Um
C :  Okay here here's just two pictures of remote controls . They're just simple T_V_ remote controls . But one is uh user-centred . That is the one on the left . And you can straight away see there's less buttons . And the other one is engineer-centred where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um
C :  which appeals more to the product that we want , and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred .
C :  Fewer buttons , simpler to use , and if ten percent um is hidden away if ten percent is what's used , maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe under some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . And the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across .
C :  Um and finally , um uh sort I've sort of covered that , our product I think should be user interface orientated . Um
C :  Like I said to concentrate on T_V_ remote control , a universal remote might be too complex . Um and as what it , the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . So that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . And then and change the fashion of remote controls .
C :  And that's it .
B :  cable there . Thank you .
A :  What was your last conclusion on that one ? Focus on uh the i
C :  On something on the image of it . Uh the f the actual design .
A :  the image of it .
A :  'Kay . Good . Good .
B :  Okay . Gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . Right . So unfortunately the people who were supposed to
B :  do this little presentation for me obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it , so um I'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . Um just
B :  This is the basic
B :  basic premise of a remote control . Um the basic function is to send messages to another system . Okay so much is clear . An energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , that can compose messages . Often in the form of infrared bits . This is the most mostly used . Um there's uh also some sound systems but infrared is
B :  the better or the more more used system . Um parts are cheaper as well . A user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages .
B :  This is where my people screwed up basically . So I'm going to explain that on the board rather . Um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . We'll start with an energy source . Right . Um which is usually a battery right ?
B :  Since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . This energy source of course is connected to
B :  the user interface itself . Uh which can be buttons , whatever , which in fact
B :  controls a chip . Right ? This is the user interface and there we have the chip . Um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp .
B :  That sends out the signal .
B :  Of course the signal differs accordingly . Um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . And
B :  Of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . The way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp
B :  to the whole thing as well , so that you know that it's working basically . You press something , you get a response .
B :  Which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices .
B :  Now this , what we're talking about here , or what I think should be discussed are these two components mostly . The
B :  the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . What we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . We cannot change the chip which controls the infrared lamp . Right ? These two are components that we have to use , and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . Um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . It c it doesn't have to be there . This can be discussed as well .
B :  The user interface . That's something we can also discuss . Um as we've heard
B :  uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment .
B :  Speech recognition um interface , we don't know that . Or if we just do the usual button thing . Or we have a touch pad or something like that that's something we can discuss . And of course the energy source . Batteries . Solar cells . Who knows ?
B :  Of course it's always a question whether these these components are in fact available cheap enough , developed enough . But that's like I s I suppose rather up to marketing , and not to
A :  So we could the the the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive
B :  to the industrial design department .
B :  Expensive it's gonna be get uh . Yeah .
A :  But people have said that they would well younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . So
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right .
A :  possibly it might be worth the investment .
C :  I think speech recognition was
C :  uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . 'Cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I agree .
C :  And you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects I suppose as well .
A :  Well
A :  I myself I find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . Like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . Sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end , and you say one for this , and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I find myself , especially if I'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly . So maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then
C :  Yeah .
C :  And wou I don't know if would would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff . If you were watching something would you sort of be wanting
A :  you know , you
A :  Volume up . Volume down . Change the channel , you know channel up , channel down ? I I don't know .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Another thing about these figures is ninety one percent of the youngest age groups said they'd do it , but probably a lot of them that's actually their parents money . Like I don't know if they would actually go out and purchase this themselves , a fifteen year old you know .
C :  I think
C :  As well it'd be j the gimmick factor for the younger people . But practically I don't think it's
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It's a , it's a gimmick factor that they like at first , and
C :  Yeah . It'll wear off .
D :  Gets old yeah .
A :  Okay . Um
A :  Let's see here .
C :  Do you wanna put your cord back in ?
A :  Yeah I guess so .
B :  Oh right .
A :  Trade you .
B :  go .
A :  Now I was sent a couple of
A :  things to modify our uh new requirements . Um the remote's only gonna be for the television , which is good because we already decided y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly . And your re uh research showed that you know most of the people don't even use it . I think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons . So if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . Um no teletext . Um
D :  Mm .
A :  So we don't have to worry about that . Um but we do have to use the the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , which is we put the fashion in electronics . And our corporate colours are grey and yellow .
A :  And we could probably get away with black too but
A :  So those are the three um the three new requirements that that I was told
A :  we need to use . Um from all all three of your uh presentations , I think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . Um
A :  We want something that looks good . Um we want something that's simple . We want something that you can find easily . Um
A :  And the speech recognition I I guess is kind of uh give or take . It's gonna cost more . S the young the younger people say that they like it . But um it's
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  probably , I would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . So maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . Um
A :  And that way we can focus on our form .
C :  I did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . Is that if it came with maybe a holder
C :  or holster , whatever you wanna call it . Um that you you should put it back in . Your remote . But if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something . Just by infrared . That shouldn't be too complex I would've thought .
A :  That'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball .
C :  Yeah it would be quite good . The ball could sit on a
A :  Or or with you know I guess with any form that that would be good . You know that could be the charger . For you know we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . And that would be or solar . Or you know However , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . Um
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  With the locator button .
A :  Um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um like if we still have the how to hold on to it and
B :  Well you still do . You s you still
B :  W yeah . You put it on t on the couch table . While you're watching , it's gonna roll off . So that's not an issue really .
D :  Rolls away yeah .
A :  It's gonna roll away .
A :  Um
A :  So I guess after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires . And uh
A :  and some summaries for for what's going on . Um then we'll take lunch . Then we can come back and uh work on our individual work .
A :  Um
A :  I'll do the minutes .
A :  Uh let's see .
A :  It looks like you're already on your way for uh
A :  working with the components . Um chips , the what chips we need and what uh
B :  .
A :  you know how to power it and whatnot .
A :  User interface concept , we want it to be something simple .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um
A :  Minimal number of buttons .
A :  I guess our , I guess our main um
A :  main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
B :  That's
A :  Did you have time earlier to to work on that . Did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ?
D :  Not really .
C :  I'll yeah I'll have a look , try look at the actual appearance in the next break .
A :  'Kay .
C :  I th I I do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . The ball is probably not a good idea . And even something that's held like that might be difficult . So that I think it still has to be a variation .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  On maybe a
C :  a rect on a rectangle but maybe not necessarily as
C :  boring , as plain as a rectangle .
D :  Mm .
A :  Um
A :  Shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ?
A :  That way we could l I mean
A :  if it were , if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote . Or girls or older people ?
A :  Um
A :  Would that you think that would help us find um a specific form ?
A :  That we would would wanna pick out ?
C :  D I don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . I find anything more on that .
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah not yet but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that .
A :  'Kay .
A :  um we know that the remote's gonna have to be we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . Um yellow and you know yellow it's nice and bright , with the buttons being grey or black . And our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom or the you know . Um
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Bottom perhaps yeah .
A :  Maybe we could sketch a so basically
A :  all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort . You know . Um maybe we could flare it or something . You know . So it's more of course this will look like a bone then . go ahead and erase this . Um
A :  Hope everyone memorised that uh
C :  You I mean it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . They've gone from big brick block things , which is a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah everybody's got a mobile phone right ? Except for me now . Uh
A :  But they are all , you know , mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . Um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time . But then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone that was this big and you had a handbag to carry it around in . Um
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  Right .
A :  So we've got basically what
A :  remotes look like now is kind of what we're
A :  what we're stuck with . Um
A :  Maybe we could go with a square or something . Um
B :  Hm .
A :  Um you know with minimal number of buttons .
A :  I guess you've got you know one through nine .
A :  For typing in your channels . Uh you've got
A :  volume , up and down . Channel up and down .
D :  Power .
A :  Power .
A :  Usually at the top . Um a mute .
B :  That's the classical design .
A :  That's that's pretty much all you need I think . Um
A :  A menu button , maybe .
B :  Right .
A :  So you know .
A :  If you , if we want the remote to do other things like um or I guess the T_V_ to be able to change the tint and the colour and you know all those kind of things that are built into T_V_s , we just have that under one standard menu button where you go in , press the menu button , scroll up and down to select it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Um
B :  Talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad .
A :  'Kay so
B :  It's
A :  Um
B :  Talk about maybe f look at that from the side , there maybe . Which is technically the easiest option . Would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . So .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Like a wheel on your mouse .
B :  Yeah , sort of like that . You can even
A :  Sort of .
B :  if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down .
B :  Right . Also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . Just which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on .
A :  'S a good idea .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I know . You know what I'm getting at here , fel look at it from the side . It's like that . Right . Uh
A :  Look g yeah . Looks good .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Then you hold it in your hand like this . And maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side . Right . Mm .
C :  Yes s
A :  To the thumb . Yeah .
C :  To the thumb yeah . Maybe the buttons could like uh
C :  decrease in s the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here .
B :  Right . You can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open .
C :  Yeah .
B :  With the lesser used functions on this part , and then it slides into that part . And out .
C :  Behind . Definitely .
C :  just like o on a sort of side view .
C :  Something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . So you know you just sort of have your hand
B :  Mm well I was just thinking , this this of course causes
C :  Yeah . Right on the and your thumb would be up here type thing .
B :  causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . So .
C :  Yeah that's also true .
C :  instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person .
B :  Right .
C :  But I mean the older so
A :  Yeah is everyone who in here's right-handed , left-handed ? You guys all right-handed ? Yeah . So I'm left-handed but I , so I can say that most things are designed for right-handed people .
D :  Right .
B :  Right .
C :  Right-handed , yeah .
D :  Uh-huh .
B :  That's right .
A :  Like the written language . Or English .
D :  Maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . Special order .
A :  Maybe . Ow . I would say I mean it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um but that's that's good . That's w I think we've got a kind of a good plan there . Um
A :  At least for what buttons we're gonna use . Um
A :  So we've got uh
A :  I like the scroll , the scroll action and the
C :  I mean I'm just just thinking maybe
A :  .
C :  if it was um
C :  with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . So you'd have your , you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there .
C :  And then your thumb would do you'd have all the buttons sort of round here . And that I think could work . On any hand . If you just had it like wrapped round there . Left or right .
A :  Yeah . Kinda like holding a
D :  Mm .
B :  Right .
B :  That minimises it size-wise as well .
C :  Minimise its size . It could be you know really quite small .
B :  Mm .
B :  Then there's maybe
B :  another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing . If we have a smaller
B :  a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . You give it the full functions in here , and just a couple of functions in there . Like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , uh volume , and on-off . That's it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Zapping functions .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Could be good .
B :  Maybe .
A :  So two remotes in one .
A :  But then would be easier to lose
A :  one or the other .
B :  That's right .
B :  Means the big one has to be sufficiently big . And perhaps heavy , so you can't move it around .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  It actually is your coffee table .
B :  Make it a piece of furniture . yes . Yes , there you go .
B :  Or a statue or something .
A :  Okay . Well we need to finish up here . Um
A :  So for the next
A :  So for the next um before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on you're watching trends to see what what kind of new information we've got going on . Um
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yep .
A :  Manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use . Let's go with our our uh rounded
B :  Right .
A :  kind of fit in your hand let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece . So one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . Um
B :  Alright .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And Ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user . So both of those concepts .
C :  How well it'll work yeah .
A :  And uh okay I think we made some good progress here . see you in
B :  Alright .
A :  I dunno . I gu I guess we'll take lunch
A :  in about uh half an hour . Or I guess we'll be taking lunch shortly and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Alright .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Everybody found his place again ? Yeah ? That's nice . Okay so this is our second meeting . And uh still failing ?
D :  Yes .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh now we're going um into the functional design . Um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design .
A :  So that we can move onto the second uh phase . But first this phase . Um first an announcement . There's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . So
A :  There's our ghost mouse again . That that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , that's because of this uh
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  It's in wing C_ and E_ . So it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . But it's going to be cold anyway , so I don't think you're gonna need it . Then our agenda . Now first the opening . Uh this time I will take the minutes .
D :  No .
A :  Uh you're going to have a presentation . All of you . Um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . So uh I suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements uh which have been sent to me .
A :  And then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . So we've got forty minutes for all of it . So I suggest um let's start with the first presentation . Um who wants to be first ?
D :  Yes .
D :  Think I'll go first .
A :  Okay . So
A :  Just maybe it's easier if you um Yeah I think you will tell your presentation as well . Just which function you have and what you're gonna talk about .
D :  'Kay . My name is Freek Van Ponnen . I'm the Market Expert . But you already knew that .
D :  Um I've done some research . We have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab where we observed um users operating remote controls . Uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . We had one hundred of these uh test subjects .
D :  Uh in addition we did some market research . Uh see what the market consists of . What ages are involved .
D :  Well these are three quite astonishing results , I thought . Um remotes are being considered ugly . F uh seventy five percent of the um
D :  people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . Um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . So
D :  Um in addition remotes were not very functional . Fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control .
D :  And fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room .
B :  Mm .
D :  some things .
D :  Then we did some research to the most relevant functions . Channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . The power button got a nine . And teletext got a six and a half . So these are the most
D :  most uh important functions on a remote control . Then there are some one-time use function . That's what I like to call them . That uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . Which are not really used very frequently , but are still considered to be of some importance .
D :  Um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . One hundred and sixty eight times per hour .
D :  Then these are the This is the market . Um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six .
D :  Um
D :  Main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . Um they like to use new f new functions . But they also are very critical . They won't spend their money very easily . So
D :  Um the users of forty six to sixty five years cons The make up forty percent of the market .
D :  They are not really very interested in features . But they do tend to spend their money a lot easier .
D :  Um
D :  What I think this indicates for our um
D :  design . I think we should make a remote for the future . And this means we would
D :  um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five .
D :  Uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable .
D :  Um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design .
D :  Um
D :  The results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused R_S_ R_S_I_ .
D :  Um this is certainly something to take into account . And thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . So these are two factors that I think should be included in the design . Besides of course that the remote must look very nice .
D :  And the functionality
D :  As a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , I think we should make very few buttons . Uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote .
D :  Uh I think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . Especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . 'Cause they're used most and so they should be robust . They shouldn't break down easily .
D :  Um
D :  Then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , it might be
D :  and I say might be because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . But it might be a good idea to make a docking station . And this would , could get a button in it which would send a signal to the remote which would then beep .
D :  So you'd know where it is in the room . And in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in .
D :  Then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an L_C_D_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . This was um
D :  mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . But up till forty five it remains feasible . This would also greatly increase the production costs but I think these are just some small factors we could consider .
A :  Okay .
D :  That would be all .
A :  Thank you . So anybody have um any questions until now ?
D :  Any questions ?
A :  About functional requirements ? Okay that's clear .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  No .
A :  Now to the second .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Uh okay . Um I've been looking at uh the user interface of it . Um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . Um
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah you can take your time . We've got uh plenty of time , so
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm ?
D :  Yeah you should go to the top thingy . Slide show . Oh yeah .
B :  Oh .
B :  Uh .
A :  Yeah . There it is . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Um yeah . I think uh we uh must use the general functions uh of the uh remote control . Uh uh I've do I've uh done a little uh research on the internet and not much information about it , Um about uh interface but uh Uh
B :  Yeah I I've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . Uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh D_V_D_ uh uh television , uh stereo . So um
B :  But uh it must be uh user-friendly . So um uh you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh Yeah . Uh uh uh Yeah . In one um remote control . But um
A :  One remote .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um yeah . Got uh many functions in one uh remote control , um but um yeah you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control .
B :  Um few uh buttons but uh This uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . Um uh people uh don't like it , uh so um
B :  Well what uh I was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . So uh like uh the on-off uh button . Uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . Uh everybody everybody knows it so uh uh you don't have to change that . Um
B :  My personal uh preferences um . Use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . So um
B :  Wh what I was th uh thinking about was um you've got um
B :  Uh this the remote control uh and uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh I dunno um And um here you've got a s kind of a display .
A : 
B :  It's a touchscreen . So um yeah you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a D_V_D_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh . And um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device .
B :  So um this button is for a D_V_D_ or So um for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . So uh you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device . So uh that's uh my uh idea about it . Um yeah and
A :  Hmm .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Uh let's see . Uh yeah . So a touchscreen . Uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . We better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh for um yeah . Everybody uh have to use it so
B :  Uh ol even even old people um young people . So uh we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . So uh Um
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Uh yeah .
B :  That was uh my uh part of it . So
A :  Okay . Anybody has questions about the technical functions ?
C :  Well I think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half Euros .
B :  N I I don't think so . Uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . S um it's uh not uh in colour or something . Uh it's just uh um one colo Uh yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Touchscreen .
B :  Uh I seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago . Uh you got uh yeah quite an uh
B :  a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh for
B :  uh twenty uh Euros or uh less uh . So it's possible .
A :  Huh .
D :  Hmm .
A :  'Kay . That's nice . Uh
D :  Well it would certainly make a fancy design .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  But the It wouldn't be very robust . It's very fragile and you can get scratches on it .
D :  So
D :  That is true .
A :  That's right . Uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ? Uh And then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design .
B :  Yeah that's true .
D :  We would have to look into that .
B :  Uh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That's .
C :  Okay .
A :  I think it's going to Uh it's not too much . Okay .
C :  Okay I've got a presentation about the working design . Um first about how it works . It's really simple of course . Everybody knows how a remote works . The user presses a button . The remote determines what button it is , uses the infrared to send a signal to the T_V_ . The T_V_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is .
C :  So we've got um the the plate . It gots conductive disks for every button . When the user presses a button , a signal got sent , goes to the LED and transmits tranmi transmits its to the T_V_ .
C :  It's a very simple device , technically speaking . So this is a schematic overview . You've got the buttons . The power source . And uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . The chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . When you press a button you can actually see your pressed button .
C :  Well um I think we should use default materials , simple plastics . Keep the inner workings simple , so it's robust . Uh I think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high .
C :  And uh you only have to design a remote once , and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product .
C :  So it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself .
C :  That's it .
A :  Okay . Thank you .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh
A :  Okay now I hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have and what we are doing right now . Um I'm the Project Manager so I'm here to mess things up and uh tell you some new uh requirements .
A :  Um that's , we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for T_V_ . Um that's because uh it will be too complex and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
A :  So it has to be simple . Uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . And uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control .
A :  Um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . Uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well .
A :  Another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . Uh that's the the market we have to to to target , because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers .
A :  Um this is uh a bit pity for the Marketing uh Expert . Because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . So we have to find a market which is above forty plus uh but which will suit our
A :  uh remote control , and the other way round . And we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . So it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . And uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . So I suggest
A :  let's have a discussion on the control functions .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ?
A :  Uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . Um
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . And new T_V_s will have internet access on them . But I think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a T_V_ with internet access
D :  within the next like twenty years is very slim .
B :  Yeah .
D :  In addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . So I think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it .
D :  I'm pretty much against it .
A :  Against the no teletext ?
B :  Mm .
D :  Yes .
A :  Um
D :  Besides that , I think the market for forty plus is like
D :  pretty small .
D :  But I mean if I s if I see this , it's I think we're just gonna go for another
A :  Yeah it's it is
B :  forty
A :  Standard remote .
A :  No I think we can
D :  and not innovative
D :  remote control .
A :  I think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons which were also mentioned . Uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . Or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach because it is forty percent of the market .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And um if you look in Holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now .
D :  Yes but it's not the biggest part of the
D :  market .
A :  No .
D :  And besides that , they're not very critical so I mean they don't really care
D :  what the remote control is like . They'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable .
A :  But don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the the device I've looked for although I didn't realise it . So let's try it .
D :  No .
D :  I think that would be the case in the
D :  sixteen to forty five age category .
D :  because they are critical and they they want to have a fancy remote control .
B :  Yeah .
D :  People of forty plus , I mean they want it to work , but
D :  as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I think that if we're If we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um I don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ?
D :  So
A :  Yeah . It's a big success .
C :  Yeah if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , I think . We don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . We just
D :  I haven't heard of it .
A :  Very big success . Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Uh . I think so as well .
B :  Mm .
C :  change our focus on the project , and I think
C :  we can uh we can sell this .
A :  Uh I simply think um
A :  uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people .
A :  And I think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . 'Cause what you told is the channel selection is important . Volume selection , power and teletext . Okay . Um
D :  Yes .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  But obviously the board tends to disagree .
A :  No we we haven't voted yet , so Uh I think teletext can be uh
A :  um can be a function as well . But only if uh if it won't
A :  higher the the cost , because I don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , but I don't think it will be a problem .
A :  Or is teletext a
B :  But um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . So it's Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , also .
A :  Yeah . So I suggest uh
D :  I think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext .
B :  It's
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Is anybody um really against teletext ?
C :  No .
A :  No ? Just that , that we just keep the teletext .
A :  I think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles .
A :  Maybe we can
A :  make that um
A :  another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , which is instantly on the remote control . For elderly people they can think , oh I wanna have subtitles , and they push the button and they get the big subtitles .
B :  Yeah yeah .
C :  Uh that's a good idea .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Um so I think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . Um
A :  Functionality should be few buttons , you said .
D :  Yes .
A :  I think uh that's very important we have a few buttons .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So to keep it simple .
D :  I don't think that's really an issue any more 'cause
D :  Well might be .
B :  If it's only for televi Yeah .
D :  But I mean it , if it's only for T_V_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . You need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel ,
B :  Yeah .
A :  No .
B :  Yeah .
D :  volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons but
A :  Yeah .
A :  But do you need
D :  I think if you if you only l
B :  So we can s we can skip the display , so uh we don't need it .
A :  But do you need the buttons for one to zero . Maybe c we can
D :  Nah .
B :  Uh
D :  Think if you're gonna include teletext you do . I think many people like to use that . 'Cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times .
A :  Maybe we can use uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  No , maybe we can implement the scroll button ?
A :  Or a joystick like ?
B :  Mm .
A :  There are other ways too . Just look if you look at telephones . The Sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  That's true but um
D :  I don't think there are many T_V_s that can switch channels that fast . And so you would need like
D :  the T_V_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it .
D :  And I dunno if many channels would
D :  do have that . If many T_V_s have that .
C :  Yeah . And besides that it's um If we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . They're not used to using scroll buttons . So perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout .
B :  Mm .
A :  That's right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  the numbers yeah . Yeah they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it . But I think there won't be very much buttons . Or there don't have to be a lot .
B :  Yeah .
D :  But I don't think I think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a T_V_ , you there's not much you can gain on
D :  um having as few buttons as possible . 'Cause I think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a T_V_ , which already only have the minimum number of buttons . I don't think there's much to be gained in that area .
B :  Hmm .
A :  The number of buttons ? I think it's very important in the in the design .
D :  Yeah .
A :  You can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . And if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with
D :  That is true but I think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the T_V_ .
A :  To operate only the T_V_ yeah .
D :  'Cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a T_V_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required .
D :  There's not a lot of functions required so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either .
A :  No .
B :  No .
A :  So .
D :  So I think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here .
A :  'Kay . So we can
D :  That would that would cost a a big marketing
A :  Yeah .
A :  That's right .
D :  which was
D :  one of the arguments to make it only for the T_V_ because we didn't have the time to market a lot .
A :  Yeah . So you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station .
A :  Uh uh like other functions .
D :  Maybe .
A :  Instead of f of less buttons .
D :  yeah I think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons and
D :  But I don't think we should spend very much time in that .
A :  Mm . No . Do you think the docking station will
A :  uh is allowed in the budget we have ?
C :  It should be possible yes . If it's not too fancy . And if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible yeah .
A :  'Cause it can be
B :  No .
A :  No .
A :  Yeah . Because I think that's uh
B :  No .
A :  That's a good advantage point as well . If we have a fancy-looking docking station or very That's a nice requirement .
C :  Yes .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Docking station .
C :  So we're just gonna focus on the extras ?
A :  I think so .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah I think maybe we should do some research into
D :  what elderly people like to have in a
A :  Yeah .
D :  like to have extra in a new remote control .
A :  That's a good point . Um
A :  You said they easily get lost as well .
D :  Yes well fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something .
D :  Yeah that was what I suggested . You have it on Yeah you have it's on some phones too , which have a docking station . And you just press a button and the phone goes ringing .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Hm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So audio signal should be possible as well . I think it's not too expensive . Uh another
D :  So you know where it is .
B :  No .
A :  point is the L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Um I don't know if that will rise the cost too much , because
C :  Y i um I think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , 'cause
A :  Yeah . It will be too much as well .
C :  it's uh
B :  Mm .
D :  I think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , and we're focusing on elderly people here which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , which would explain a button if you press it . Which would tell you what it does .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And it wouldn't have to be touchscreen or a very expensive screen , but
A :  Based .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  Just the L_C_D_ . Oh just the normal screen .
D :  Just a small screen with two
A :  That's a good idea . So Some extra info . Feedback .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think that's a good idea as well .
B :  Yeah .
D :  But I dunno if that would
A :  As the small screen .
D :  that would fit into the
D :  costs .
A :  Extra button info .
A :  I think that should be possible as well . Um let's see what did we say . Mm . More . Should be fancy to , fancy design , easy to learn . Few buttons , we talked about that . Docking station , L_C_D_ . Um general functions
A :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
A :  And default materials .
A :  I think that's a good idea as well , because um elderly people don't mind if it's a titanium cover or just a plastic one . So that doesn't really matter . So I think we nee
D :  No .
B :  Mm .
D :  I think probably elderly people would be a little bit more careful with their remote controls than
D :  youngsters .
A :  Uh let's um specify the target group . Because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . Because I think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh what do we want ? If we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can
D :  I think
A :  target the real elderly people .
D :  I think that would be a If we should do something like that it would be a , I think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And I think , I think there would be a good market for it .
A :  So that's the
D :  If we're able to really bring an innovative product .
A :  Now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example .
D :  Yeah the really
A :  Yeah . Sixty .
B :  Mm .
D :  I'd have to look into that a little more .
A :  Okay . And different cultures . Are we
C :  Well I don't think they have different television sets uh
B :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
C :  in uh every country .
A :  No .
B :  No .
C :  'Cause
A :  We've got five minutes left just now . Small warning .
B :  So 'Kay .
D :  'Kay . And with uh the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . You could I think we n it would be a lot easier to
A :  Should
D :  adapt it to different cultures .
A :  Yeah . In different languages , you know . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  or you have to put a language button in it , but that will be a bit unnecessary I think . It's better to put it on different markets with it all . Okay . So that's the the target . Uh then a few small things .
B :  Right .
B :  No . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uh okay . I will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . Um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the Industrial Designer will do the components concept , User Interface Designer the user interface concept , and the trend-watching .
A :  So just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on . And uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach .
D :  'Kay .
A :  So um I thank you for this meeting . And I think we have a lunch-break now .
D :  That's good .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So that's a good thing .
A :  I just forgot their name , so uh you're i sorry , I just forgot them all . So I have to write it down .
D :  Okay .
A :  So
D :  Fine .
A :  Do you know them or
D :  The names ?
A :  Yeah .
D :  For for for my sur um Jens .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , no , but your b your surname .
D :  Uh Damman .
D :  D_ A_ W_ .
D :  Uh uh M_ M_ . I mean M_ . Double M_ .
A :  W_O_ da . Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  And what's your name ?
B :  Paul Wiezer . Paul Wiezer .
A :  W_I_E_S_ z Z_ or S_ ? Uh uh zee . Okay . What's your name ?
B :  A_ E_ Z_ zee zee
B :  E_ R_ .
C :  Uh Martijn .
A :  Yeah , but your surname .
C :  What ?
A :  Your surname .
C :  Uh Abbing . A_ B_ B_ I_ N_ G_ .
A :  Okay , thanks .
B :  Uh .
C :  I was a little short on time , but
A :  Yeah , me too , so that's not No no no , I just fi first my
B :  Yeah , same here .
D :  Oh . Sorry .
B :  Uh let's see . Which one was mine ?
A :  So let's have a look , we have forty minutes , so it's it's more than enough .
A :  Okay , perfect . So we have Oh no , what's that ?
A :  So so we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting , and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are ,
B :  Good .
A :  that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like look like . Uh first I have the notes of the last meeting , so I showed uh show them to you .
A :  Oh , sorry about that , I just escape this one .
A :  How do I escape this ?
C :  What ?
A :  How do I I escape this s uh presentation ?
B :  Uh left . So
C :  Uh
A :  Ah okay . And show , sorry . Okay , so let's have a look s at this one .
C :  Just Yeah .
A :  Okay , so the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um Should be a univ uh universal remote control No , that's I uh s I just got a email from the from the personal coach and it should be a T_V_ remote control only . So have you changed that part ? Um so yeah , it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . It's it's still the same . Um
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  All these points uh we have to
A :  look at . You all know them . But uh there's another point . The um uh the main
A :  uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . So they're old and not younger people . So we have to look at that as well . 'Specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , I dunno .
B :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Uh so
A :  So yeah , that's it , so just you can do your presentation for uh
B :  Which one first ?
D :  Okay .
A :  Oh it doesn't matter , just start with the
B :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
D :  Uh
B :  Functional requirements , yeah .
D :  Okay . Well my name is Jens Damman , but we're in a group , and I I will start it . Wait . Um I've
D :  used a marketing report on uh the site . Uh I think you've uh read it too . Uh and uh f and furthermore I uh surfed the o the other site .
A :  I I didn't read i read it , so it's not for me , I didn't get it uh anyway . It's only for you .
D :  You didn't read it ?
B :  No , I didn don't thing we got it . Yes .
D :  Oh okay , I I was the only one who get it . Okay it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof .
D :  So I um I had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . So we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . Uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly .
D :  Yeah , I think uh uh that's a lot , so we have to make a beautiful remote control . Uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy .
D :  I think this fits uh at the uh what what uh Michael said about uh older people . Older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . Because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at .
D :  Uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . Well okay , that's uh normal . I think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . But that's one of our requirements .
A :  The last point is quite an interesting
D :  Yes , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . Um Martijn alr already said it . And uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , but
A :  So if we
A :  Yeah .
D :  I don't think it's uh
A :  Yeah , we should have the ten percent on the on the top , then you're you're
D :  reachable .
D :  Yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah . That that's a good one . Um uh page two . Remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . That's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Uh I thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , so when you clap your hands it will beep or something . Uh you must find it uh quickly .
B :  Uh .
B :  Maybe just a button on the home station . So remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station .
D :  Okay , yeah . Yeah , we can uh combine that . Uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . Uh I think we must t uh take a look at this .
D :  It's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent . But it's uh a tough one . Because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty I think .
D :  Uh next , remote controls are bad for R_S_I_ . Yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours T_V_ or something . I don't We we haven't Uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point .
D :  Okay , last page . Uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . We didn't uh think about that already . And uh an L_C_D_ on the remote control . We already thought about that .
D :  Um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . And but they're more critical .
D :  And older people uh want to spend uh more money . But uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , because they're in their old uh thinking way . And they want to keep the old uh things the old things .
A :  So we have uh a new uh age of forty plus .
D :  But y But you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ?
A :  People . So yeah , so we just can skip the L_C_D_ r on the remote control , because
D :  I I think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , because it's not reachable for twenty five Euros . Um then
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . It's too Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I have my personal uh preference . Okay , that's not very good , because I thought about television , D_V_D_ player , stereo and V_C_R_ . I had a question about . But it's already out of the question , this .
D :  Um my point is , well , I If we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , I think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five Euros . But it's the exercise .
A :  Because it's too expensive . Yeah , probably .
D :  Yeah , only only for television uh On the market you can now buy for twenty Euros a remote control for everything . And we only make it for television , so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special .
B :  Yeah , but good usability , so you can use it .
D :  Okay , I told about the home station . Uh it must be simple , because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it .
D :  And I I found a motto . And we put the fashion in electronics . And that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . We we have to make a a new product . We have to be um Yeah .
D :  One of a kind , I think .
A :  So it has to look uh uh uh unique , but
B :  Unique .
D :  The company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style .
B :  Yeah , I reckon
A :  Yeah .
A :  But old people are not looking for that .
B :  Uh I think mm
A :  Not really .
C :  Yeah . I think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product . Yeah .
B :  Uh
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , to k to keep it simple when you Sorry I thought about it , yes .
A :  Okay . Yeah .
B :  But uh we also have to stand out , 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . But we have to make sure that we're better usability , and stand out by just looks of it . So make it just a different colour or different shape , so
A :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  Okay , this was uh my presentation .
A :  Thanks .
C :  Okay .
D :  I don't Yeah . You can ask some questions or something .
A :  So Paul , you can do the next one if you want .
B :  Okay . Yeah well
B :  Uh .
A :  It's on the on the uh net net uh thing , isn't it ?
B :  There it is .
B :  Okay . Technical functions design .
B :  Okay , well , so we have s mm uh broad audience . Isn't that isn't true anymore . But um we have elderly people , so we need to keep it simple . Uh the way I want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard .
B :  So standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . Not too full , like uh Jens already said , only ten percent is being used .
A :  So what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or
B :  Yeah , I have it on the next page . But yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . Um so the options that we put on there should be easy to use , and 'cause you have more room then , and for elderly people big buttons . Uh an icon on it or text on it , so it's very clear what that buttons does . So it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it .
A :  Okay .
B :  Um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet or
B :  just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control
A :  Yeah .
B :  to find out . But there is already in a
B :  one done . Of functions I could think of . Uh volume , channels , the the basic according to .
B :  Just one two three etcetera . Uh text service options .
B :  Um basic on-off . And I found an uh Could I think of favourites ? I always look up the same um pages on text and always have to click the number . But if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button and you get on your
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . So you might as well remember the number .
C :  Or not ?
A :  Maybe i maybe it's too complicated , but not sure . It's a good idea , but
B :  No y
B :  Well it's It was just a thought . So I'm , I u I would find it handy , I think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six .
C :  Yeah , okay . But um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ?
B :  Well uh what I was reading on the page . Uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . So switch to channel six . So uh button six says says six . And if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . Just numbers . That can be in the in the
A :  Uh
C :  Yeah ?
C :  Yeah okay . But uh uh for a user to to remember , if I press that button it goes to that channel .
B :  Well if you said a favourite
C :  Yeah , but isn't it hard to remember ? Like favourite one and
A :  Uh mayb for me it's If I use my telephone , I never use those buttons to to to call sh Never .
B :  Well i
C :  Mm as as hard as
B :  Never ? Oh .
C :  No , neither do I .
B :  Oh are you ?
A :  So And
B :  Okay now , m maybe not .
A :  If I don't do it , maybe old people
B :  No , maybe elderly people uh . Right . They don't like new features . So maybe not .
C :  Yeah , I dunno .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um well play , pause . I dunno if that's usable when
A :  It's not , it's still not It's not anymore n uh
B :  Not anymore for T_V_ . Right , on off . I dunno , miss Did I miss any other buttons , basic buttons ?
D :  Um
B :  I couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for T_V_ .
A :  Just on the front as well . No , that's the only th the only thing you need .
B :  Is
C :  Uh uh the p uh next and previous . Previous I know , but next channel ? I don't thi
B :  Just the channel um uh What I mean is uh
D :  Forward .
C :  Li like a web browser , so Oh , okay . But uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before .
B :  Six seven eight or five .
A :  Just very simple .
C :  Like a web browser back button .
B :  Um I dunno . I don't have Uh I did
A :  Uh Yeah , I know what it is , but I think it's all too difficult for old people .
D :  No . Uh
B :  Yeah , I don't think you use that . Y only when you want to go to
C :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah , just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time .
A :  And how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? Normally you can press one , zero or
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I think um f Especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . So you have that uh
A :  A ten plus or
B :  Yeah , the ten plus button . Just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other .
A :  Okay .
B :  To just keep it simple and standard uh features .
C :  Yeah , w wouldn't it be a problem to uh Because you h have to be fast enough . Maybe the elderly people
B :  Uh yeah mayb But I think that's in the T_V_ as well . That's how the uh the T_V_ T_V_ handles it . But you can have a button that says um
D :  It gets some seconds .
B :  two two st two stripes . So you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons .
C :  Oh okay . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , it's it's no it's not a
C :  Yeah , but that's th mm
D :  It's what Paul says . It's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the T_V_ um do one two . It's the T_V_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two .
C :  Okay .
B :  So if you have a universal T_V_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . So we have a a period of , I dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that And not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But do we still need a two level remote control ? Because if we only have that l only f No .
D :  It's only for television now .
B :  So I I don't think so . Uh I just thought of another one . Most things in modern T_V_s are also on the menu . So you also need a menu button . And then uh navigation uh
D :  No .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , so you have
C :  Yeah .
C :  I I think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button . Because you n almost never use menu button . So
B :  four arrows .
B :  Yeah , okay , but um
A :  Maybe it's still still a good idea , I'm not sure . You'll also have to use a mute button to to
B :  Yeah , a mute button . Yes . Don't think so .
A :  Maybe , not I don't know where where you have to put it .
B :  Yeah well , that's that's I think that's the layers that produce . Now I have to figure out what's uh what to put on . What we're gonna use . And later we can d uh do the design .
A :  Okay . Yeah . Yeah . That's right .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay , uh now my personal preferences . Uh using the standards , basic
B :  Um I think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design .
B :  So we have to , I dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . So when you are in the shop and you see our T_V_ controller hanging , that it stands out . Not just in in the row when you see
B :  all the same uh remote controls .
A :  Yeah . Does it have to be Uh it has to be uh with different colours or
B :  Um
B :  I dunno . Different colours um
D :  Maybe we can give it out in different colours . You can choose blue or yellow or
A :  It's like a iMac or something . Just to make it
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . Well why not ? Or Yeah .
D :  That's fa That's fancy . That's uh fashion .
A :  But it looks cheap as well , because it's a small thing . It's only twenty five Euros . It looks very cheap if you make it
B :  Well , maybe you can look at uh mobile phones . Oh .
A :  Oh , you just I dunno what happened .
B :  Who ?
A :  Yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . Just
B :  They they're uh designed very well . And well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . You think you can't make a T_V_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But uh well , I think that's a good example .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay , we hurry up a bit , because otherwise we won't make it . Is it fin Are you finished ? Okay .
B :  Okay , sorry . Well uh Yeah , I I'm finished . I think we discussed everything .
C :  Okay .
C :  Well , the working design .
C :  The method I used is uh search the web . Just the web page provided .
C :  Um
C :  Basically I'm I'm not very technical uh uh educated , but uh I could figure it out . Um basically what happens is you press a button , uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch .
C :  And by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . So like you press a one , that circuit is closed and uh Then the chip produces a pattern .
C :  Like a Morse code to uh And and sends that to the uh L_E_D_ . That's the uh light emitting diode , I think . Um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . That's un uh invisible
C :  to the human eye . And uh transmit that uh to the T_V_ .
C :  However it has also an uh a visible uh diode that's uh blinking red if you look in it . And that's uh another diode , I believe . Because infrared is not visible . So that's er uh do two different things but
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So we we also have to have a LED li LED light on it ?
C :  Yeah . I I think so . I I'm not sure if it's the same thing .
B :  Uh j Is Ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ?
A :  Yeah , it's I think it's usable .
D :  Yeah , that's active .
A :  Yeah . Or just a green one , because it's If you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So
B :  Yeah . Maybe uh
D :  I I think it's in the case that it's active . It's not uh
C :  Yeah , when you press it . So
A :  Yeah , that's right . But if you
D :  I it's it's just uh the the
C :  Two ?
A :  Red's l shows up like something's wrong , and green is like it's okay , you press the button .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , I dunno . Ma on on most on most uh uh remote controls it's red . So
B :  Maybe depends on uh
A :  Yeah , I know . Okay , we make it red .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  So I know .
B :  But maybe Well we don't have to make it red . Maybe integrate it in the design as well .
A :  You have to The whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . Uh that's cool .
C :  I I think uh the batteries will be uh a little Yeah , okay . Uh maybe .
B :  Uh Oh , maybe it's it is would an e No . Just uh
D :  Empty .
A :  No , we have a recharger in it , so
B :  Oh .
A :  If we can still make that then
B :  Yeah , but it doesn't have to be red . It's just to indicate something's on .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . That it's working . That it's not not the batteries are low .
B :  Yeah . It's it's not very important , so yeah .
A :  But it's cool if it was green . Green or red or whatever , it is cool .
C :  Yeah , I know . Just to indicate it's working .
B :  So mm
C :  And uh the receptor in the T_V_ senses the pattern . So we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . So that it can be used with all the T_V_s . We have to really understand what patterns are used , so we can uh o On the Otherwise it won't work .
B :  So we have to uh make buttons for that as well , to make it uh
C :  No . I I uh The chip um uh is producing the pattern . So we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to Yeah . That are working .
B :  Okay .
D :  An automatically search function for each television , or something .
C :  Yeah , or I dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . It wasn't explained there .
D :  Uh I kno
B :  Well , I I use a universal uh remote control , and list of all the T_V_s you have , etcetera . And you have to put in a number , so it works on your T_V_ .
C :  Yeah ?
C :  Okay .
D :  Oh , I have a modern one . And the modern one you you uh you type uh search , and the LED began to blink blink blink . And uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . And then you know , oh it it's the right one . And you can stop it , and then it's okay .
C :  Ah okay .
D :  So you don't have to search for your television or your code . It uh search uh the pattern for itself .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay , so we use that .
C :  Okay , yeah . So it uh We have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . Because you have to Yeah .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yep .
A :  I just say Can you s just say it again , because I was just looking There's just a short
C :  Uh okay . Well uh y you have this chip . That's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern . But uh ma basically for uh brands of T_V_ these patterns are different .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So like when you press a one on one T_V_ it go go to one . And on the other T_V_ it won't work , basically .
C :  So uh basically what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . And uh by d uh that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time . And um
A :  Yeah .
D :  Changing the signal .
C :  What he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . And when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , so And then he saves that setting and then um it's working .
A :  Okay . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's the right uh option .
C :  Okay .
C :  Well uh the components . Yeah , that's a bit technical , and I hadn't I w I was a little short on time .
C :  Um but I think I understand it . Um the energy source is uh the battery , basically . Um that's connecting to all the components .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Because it has to be fed with energy . Okay . Uh the subcomponent is uh w
C :  I I think it is uh the button pressed . So basically when you press a button , a switch get closed .
C :  Um that's connecting to a chip . So the chip knows what button you pressed .
C :  And the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . I didn didn't put the description by this one . Th this is a normal bulb . So the normal flashing light .
A :  Okay . So that's the LED , L_E_D_ .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , and this is a LED too . But this one is producing infrared light that's invisible . And this one is producing normal light .
A :  Yeah , okay .
A :  So we can make the normal one also a normal light . Not a LED light , but as a normal one .
C :  Yeah
A :  To flash up your
D :  Uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . But one you can't see and one indicates that you use a button .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , presu Yeah yeah yeah . Because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can Basically if the battery is low , it won't work . So you have to indicate that it's
D :  Yeah . Yeah , and
A :  Maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . So you see green if you push that button .
C :  Huh , that's a good idea .
D :  Mm I think it's unnecessary power uh you use then .
A :  Yeah , but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal . And it's you also know which button you p
B :  No , y Yeah .
D :  Okay . But then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be LEDs .
A :  Yeah , that's right . But it
D :  Everywhere in the r
A :  But does it make any difference for the energy you use ? You got still one LED .
B :  No I don't think so , but Yeah , i it it will look different , and I think we need to find something else . Yeah .
A :  That looks different , yeah .
C :  Hmm .
B :  'Cause otherwise we will just make another standard , and our uh motto also is
D :  Is LEDs uh beneath the the buttons ?
B :  Yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even .
D :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Yeah , but mm like when you push it n n Yeah . You have your finger over the button . So you can see Yeah . Or or m maybe on top of the A green light is flashing or
B :  Yeah , then then won't Then you won't see it .
D :  It must be around it then .
D :  Yeah , then Yeah . Not not not not here , but here .
C :  Yeah . There . Yeah .
D :  Maybe uh
A :  The same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ? If you push
B :  Yeah , we're thinking about it . Uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh
A :  It lights up . Everything lights up . That's a good idea .
B :  everything lights up . Why ain't that on a remote control ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  It it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much .
B :  Yeah , if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  It's f Yeah . Maybe that's a good idea for old people as well .
B :  Yeah , i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  It's only few LEDs . Only four or something . Four LED .
B :  No , I dunno . But if we use a battery station , which I think we will use
D :  Yeah , I uh
A :  Yeah , that's a good idea , okay .
C :  Yeah . We'll have enough power to
A :  Everything agre Everyone agrees with that , or Okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
D :  Maybe what Paul said , uh under the on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps .
A :  Yeah , and then you
A :  Okay , yeah .
B :  And also it's
A :  But you have to make a sound device in it then .
D :  Yeah , there must be sound in it .
C :  Hmm .
A :  But Yeah .
D :  I dunno .
B :  Okay , it shouldn't take much
C :  Yeah . B maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make .
C :  Especially for that kind of money . Because it's i it has to be Yeah . Production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half .
D :  Mm uh , twenty five Euros , I think we can make it . Bec
B :  Uh I th
D :  Twelve and a half , okay . But but we only have to make it for television , and um we must have something special . So
C :  Yeah , okay .
B :  I think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options . But we lose about ninety percent of those options . So I think you can uh
D :  Uh .
D :  We have to give our customers some extras .
B :  Yeah . I think we will save money with that .
C :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Okay . Are you almost finished or just
C :  Yeah , the the personal preference , I didn't fill it out . Because I was short on time . But um
A :  Okay . Okay . No worry .
C :  Basically what we could do too is uh have a Bluetooth uh integration .
A :  Yeah , I just want to talk some about some more . So maybe you have to Yeah ? Okay .
C :  Yeah ? Okay .
A :  So this Oh , sorry . Wh what's that ?
A :  So uh Oh , sorry . We have some new uh project requirements . We have to have a look what they are . They're still in um
A :  Uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . So a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . I'm not sure . I don't think so , but
C :  No , and I I think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use .
D :  No .
A :  Yeah , and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . It's only one button . So I don't think it is We definitely should use it . Um
D :  Uh .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah , that's uh what I told you . The remote control should only be used for a television . So that's maybe easier .
A :  And um the the forty plus people , I already told you .
A :  Oh no , sorry . Oh , this is a problem . Oh sorry about that . The new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . So it should be flashy or just more interesting . I'm sorry about that . I just I just didn't read it well .
D :  Okay .
C :  Oh . Mm .
B :  Okay , that's It changes things .
A :  So does it make some decision about that ?
D :  Changes .
C :  Yeah . That kinda changes the whole situation .
B :  Um
D :  Uh
B :  Well yeah , then we have to make some nice features . I think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , to make it more like a mobile phone . More modern .
A :  That still stays .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  That's important I think and
D :  L_C_D_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half Euros I think .
B :  And I d I don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , especially when you only have T_V_ functions on it .
D :  Oh .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm ah I I don't y you'll use it often , because you can see on the television wh what channel you
B :  So
D :  Oh , I'm watching uh the channel one . Okay . No , it's not
B :  Yeah , I tho I think that's not usable . So , but uh Yeah . What other features can we put in ?
C :  No .
C :  Yeah . I think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . And uh then the usability is not that required , because the Like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good I think .
D :  But uh some of you had uh something to read about um uh speech uh recognition . About you said one and the television turns on one . Is that reachable maybe ? That's very That's fancy . That's cool . Twelve and you've got twelve .
C :  I didn't read
B :  It's very fashion .
C :  I didn't read any b Yeah . Yeah okay .
D :  Only the numbers , only numbers . Uh furthermore nothing . But only the numbers , one to twenty or something . That should be cool .
B :  Mm .
C :  I I know .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well .
A :  If it's possible . But
D :  If it's possible , I dunno . I didn't read it .
C :  Yeah , I don't know .
A :  I don't think it's very expensive actually . Why should it ? You only have a microphone in it .
B :  Mm .
D :  Uh if i if i I didn't have information about that .
B :  Yeah , I think it's
C :  Yeah . But it has to work . And and and does it have to work only in English , or in Dutch too or
A :  Nah , maybe
D :  Ah that's a problem , but
C :  And and uh w Yeah ?
D :  Uh only in English . Only in English I think .
B :  What But uh I dunno how that works then . Uh does your uh Does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever
C :  Yeah , it's probably my job to figure that out , but
D :  No , that
B :  uh one to have in channel one ?
D :  Yeah , then th we have to think about that . But do do we do it ? It's more if we if we do it .
B :  Yeah , I dunno . So , is it very usable ? That's what I'm looking at .
C :  And and do you have to speak in in like in a thing or
D :  Yeah .
B :  Is
A :  Maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that . It We have short time to to put it on the market , so that
C :  Yeah , I dunno .
D :  Okay .
A :  We have to do a lot of testing before we can do that .
B :  Mm Yeah well
C :  Yeah , I think so .
D :  Yeah , and uh and uh
A :  We make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy .
B :  It's
D :  In uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . Uh because we we have a lot of languages .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I d Yeah . I don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition .
C :  And and
A :  Yeah . I think so .
C :  Yeah , and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  A uh someone says that uh give me one Coke , and the T_V_ turns uh to one . Yeah , it's not uh
C :  the remote away .
C :  Mm . Hmm . Mm . Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah . Well yeah , that's the right command . And then you have to say uh T_V_ channel one , or something . Not just one , but
C :  But
C :  Hmm yeah ,
C :  T_V_ one .
D :  Okay , but th that becomes your f Uh uh because that's very hard for uh speech recognition .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well I dunno . But I don't think , it just ain't useful enough .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So we have to make some decisions . So you can see on the uh So we have to know what we're going to put on . Do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? Do If you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , so you can see what other but buttons there are , okay ?
D :  Okay , no speech recognition .
B :  Yeah , I think so .
C :  Yeah , that's good .
B :  Yep .
A :  Okay , we just take that one . And what else , we have
B :  Also the one in the dark . So uh
B :  It lights up when it's dark ? I didn't
A :  Yeah , but it's Oh th I thought would , that that would be the same . If you push something , it it all lights up .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . Yeah yeah , it it mustn't work all the time . It uh uh it have to work only when you use it . So if you No , if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off .
B :  Yeah , but um
B :  Yes , that's what I mean .
A :  Or you can switch it on or something .
B :  Or maybe when you yeah .
B :  It lights up all .
A :  Yeah , that's right . You have to Yeah , that's right . That's what I said . It's the same as the telephone . Yeah .
B :  Okay yeah . D Yeah , alright . Yeah .
A :  And do we use a a Uh what's it called ? Like a iMac , if you can look through it . Or just a normal remote control .
C :  Mm , maybe it's a good idea .
B :  Maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like iPod . Different colours , uh maybe use even different fonts .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah .
B :  Like uh phones .
A :  Different colours . Okay , so y you just make it th through You look through it ? Okay .
C :  Hmm .
D :  A see-through . Mm , that's cool .
B :  Yeah . Uh as an option maybe .
A :  And so the buttons we have , this is , yeah , this is normal . We put in the the simple buttons on the top , and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there .
B :  It's the standard
B :  Yeah , uh
D :  But you have You had a lot of different buttons .
B :  Yeah , we but we don't We don't really have any complicated buttons .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah , maybe you have you have to Uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one .
B :  Yeah okay , but
B :  Yeah , well w I think the buttons are very easy . With just uh standard buttons we just have so little
A :  O but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . Because you ne almost never use it .
B :  No , I don't need don't need Uh teletext options are only four buttons or something .
C :  Yeah , but younger people I think um more often use the internet and elderly people often use teletext . So uh
A :  Yeah , that's right .
B :  I use teletext as well .
D :  No , I use te teletext every day , I think .
C :  Hmm . Okay .
A :  Yeah . For me too , it is . So we just keep it one level then ? Okay .
B :  Yeah yeah , one level . And I think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons , I think the design is most important . You can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  'Cause simple buttons . If you put one above it , it's clear .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  So that's it for toda for We're going to have a lunch lunch break . Um
B :  How long is lunch break ?
A :  So yeah , you know what you have to do . This is uh this is it .
A :  You get your meal and everything , so
D :  Trendwatching . Okay . That's fine .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yo .
A :  So , we're finished for t for this time . We're going to have some lunch .
B :  Okay .
B :  Bye .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm . Uh .
D : 
A :  Good morning , again .
C :  One question .
B :  Yeah . Choose a number ?
C :  Send . Submit .
D :  Yep yep yep yep .
C :  Mm . Yeah .
A :  All set ? Good . Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Let's see what we can find here .
A :  Okay . A very warm welcome again to everyone . Um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . Um and this is what we are going to do . The opening , which we are doing now , um and the special note , I'm project manager but on the meetings I'm also the secretary , which means I will make uh minutes as I did of the previous meeting . And uh I also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder , so you can see them and review what we have discussed . Um if I'm right , there are three presentations , I guess each one of you has prepared one ? Good . And um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . And then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions and we have some more time , forty minutes . But I think we will need it . Um well I don't know who wants to go first with his presentation .
B :  Yes .
C :  I'll go first . Okay . I'll go first yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Well .
A :  You can go first , okay .
D :  Well , shall I go first with the users ?
B :  Well everybody already has his presentation , so you can adjust it .
D :  I think well okay no problem .
A :  Is there an order ? I haven't
D :  Ja precies , ja precies , ja precies
C :  So . Huh ?
C :  Okay , um
A :  And one question , uh your name Denni , is it with a
D :  E_I_E_ .
A :  I_E_ E_I_E_ , okay . Thank you .
C :  Okay , um I wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . It's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . Um
C :  well so it basically works uh as I uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . Uh when you press a button , uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a
A :  Sorry .
C :  on a little print plate uh which uh makes uh uh a connection that uh
C :  gives the chips , uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . Uh senses that a connection has been made , and know and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . Um uh the the chip uh makes a Morse code uh like uh signal which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors which makes uh which sends the signal to a little let . You know what a let is ? Okay . And that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal which is sent to the television set . Uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red .
B :  Yeah .
C :  That's basically uh how it works .
C :  Um the findings uh uh that I found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , uh it is pis uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page , uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh
C :  and chips . Uh and the technology's already available , we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals .
C :  Uh I made a little uh
C :  animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works .
B :  Oh right .
D :  Animation .
C :  we tel
B :  There is something turning .
C :  There .
A :  Yeah , it's a little bug it's in the in the smart board .
C :  Okay . Uh well the sub-component , I suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button . Uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh
C :  li uh a d ad uh electronic uh
D :  Infrared light .
C :  Yes , uh , okay . Um w after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb , and from there it signals a Morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set .
C :  Okay . S Uh I wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . Of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something , or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it . Uh I personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . But I suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . And it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . Perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . And uh well as I said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . Okay , well , that's my contribution to this meeting , and uh
B :  Yeah , I've got it there too .
B :  Yeah .
D :  To this meeting .
A :  Okay , thank you .
C :  two of these this meeting . So .
B :  Shall I go uh next ?
A :  Yep .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Please .
B :  So .
D :  Smoking .
B :  Well uh , my name's , and I looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . Uh I did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that I found .
B :  Um well what I found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , how you uh d what you described uh just early . And this can be all sorts of medsa messages , turn it on , turn it off , uh change the channel , adjust volume , that kind of thing . Uh play video , teletext , but also t uh play C_D_ if you use it your C_D_ player the remote control will that one . There are some uh examples of remote controls . You can see they are very different . The one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . And the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . And uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , but uh the the essential stuff is there .
B :  Um I guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , because the customers have to use them and and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . A lot of buttons they may think from I don't need s as much as that .
B :  Uh , well perf personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . But uh keep in mind the new functions of T_V_ what we discussed earlier , split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? Because all the T_V_s will have them . Or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . And then uh make it I would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . If you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . The shu c you could reuse the buttons so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . And it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much .
B :  And that is my presentation .
A :  Okay , thank you .
C :  Okay .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Check .
B :  You must still have it open .
D :  'Kay , so . We're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , that m that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , or just
D :  Yeah , and the users , actually . The methods I I prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more .
D :  Are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? And then tho that section we're going to focus and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user
D :  section . Okay . Some data . Younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like L_C_D_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . And we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . The elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area .
D :  Goed so .
C :  Hmm .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Findings . Fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . So we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , but some somewhat bi bigger than small , so you don't lose it that much anymore . Seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , so the buttons sh should be that small , or shouldn't be that complex because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Next .
D :  Important issues about the remote . I think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . Remote control has to have to have a low power usage , because s w
D :  seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , with a high power usage we would
D :  use a lot of but batteries .
D :  The volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , so those they those have to h be find very easily . And have to be somewhat like bigger
D :  etcetera . It has also be have to find easily when the label is gone . My colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off or would be s uh
C :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  senden okay . So uh if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily
D :  on the remote .
D :  Buttons . Like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized .
D :  or should be covered , or in L_C_D_ screen . L_C_D_ screen is easy because we have the L_C_D_ screen , we have the various options . Put one option and then you have the all the buttons of that options , so the other options would be gone . And you don't see the buttons . So L_C_D_ screens should be easy ,
D :  but an L_C_D_ screen , the problem with the L_ sc L_C_D_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the L_C_D_ screen a lot . So we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use .
C :  Uh L_C_D_ screen as in uh touch screen ?
D :  Yeah , touch screen , yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  The last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . Because they use the remote control often more often , and are more technical than the ol older people . And the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . So we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , but also somewhat on the elderly people . And on my personal preferences , I don't have any mo more time to come with that , but like I said , L_C_D_ screen is easily to use because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons .
B :  Mm .
C :  'Kay .
D :  And it should be easy to use . Especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels .
D :  And that is it .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , thank you .
B :  Oh right .
A :  Um , well thank you all , huh . I dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? No ? Well ,
B :  No .
B :  Res I did not . Perhaps the rest ?
C :  No .
A :  then I think it's a good thing that I made a separate slide of them so you can
D :  Ja ,
A :  all read them . Oh , well not in this presentation . Hmm .
A :  Should be in there . Well , I can tell you them uh from my laptop . Um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . So that's uh the first thing we I think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . Uh the remote control should only be used for the television , otherwise the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time to market , and of course would make it more costly , I think . Um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , and you talked about that before . And uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . So we have to keep that in mind . Um well uh according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions .
B :  Oh .
B :  Mm .
A :  So , who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ?
B :  Well you said it should only uh work with one appliance ? Or with one uh d che only the T_V_ ?
D :  Be television .
A :  Yeah . Only be used for television .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And the video also , or not uh ?
D :  Only the television .
A :  Well it says only for television here , huh .
B :  Oh . Alright . Okay .
A :  Makes it a lot easier , huh ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  So yeah , then you can yeah .
D :  Requirements , no ? Functions .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Then it should have uh on , off , and uh
C :  Yeah for
D :  Yeah , the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , oh teletext doesn't have to be ? Um other functions . Yeah I had
C :  Standby options , yeah ?
C :  Uh yeah .
B :  Yeah . And per perhaps uh
B :  No . Well uh uh yes yes s sh A button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers . Can you Don't know if that's got a name , but
C :  Two s two two digits , oh okay .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah I understand what you mean . Yeah .
D :  I think it's I think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , because some T_V_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , and that's that's not relaxed
C :  It makes it twelve , yeah .
B :  Yeah . S
C :  Indeed . Okay .
C :  Well , not really And and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function . So d uh wh the Philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj to reach channel twelve . But uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get
D :  to user .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So that it easy and fast .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , so you should have that one on .
C :  Uh yeah , think so .
D :  Our main targets' age are ? were ? Forty five plus , or ?
B :  Mute misschien also .
C :  Mm .
A :  Uh well new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , and now we have current customers uh of forty plus .
D :  Forties , okay because because younger people as
D :  Uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in L_C_D_ screen .
D :  From twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , so I think to um
D :  Because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much , two years . You have to press h very hard to go to the next channel . With the L_C_D_ screen it's easier because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint , and then you can use it again .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , we we could yeah . But I think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . Because L_C_D_ screens are very expensive . A touch screen uh probably uh even more .
D :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Yeah but a you don't know
C :  So , true , true . But uh
D :  True .
C :  Well um is it possible to make an L_C_D_ screen uh , how was the information ?
D :  Yeah , it only says that this perce percentage like L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Because , yeah and it says that younger age between sixteen and forty five highly interesting features more critical . And if the only f
C :  So perhaps we should we should focus on that L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Yeah , because our target is sixteen to forty five .
B :  But , do you
C :  Yeah but uh will we not uh
C :  exceed our uh our uh production uh
D :  Yeah you don't know how much it costs . Yeah , you don't know how much it costs , the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Is it possible to find out , anyway ? You know ?
D :  No , I don't have any costs here , I only have percentages .
B :  But if you would do an L_C_D_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? Or because if it only directs at the T_V_ , then you only have uh I don't know what you want to do with the L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Yeah .
C :  No , an L_C_D_ screen's just like uh like a drawn here . Um just uh displays several buttons , for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen and it's possible to p uh press them down , just like a touch screen .
B :  Yeah ?
B :  Oh right , so you can
B :  Oh , yeah alright . So you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen .
D :  Yeah , if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen and you get the buttons for audio settings , so the other buttons are gone .
C :  Yeah , we can make it possible to do that , yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah alright , oh right .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  So we're going for an L_C_D_ screen ?
B :  Yeah . Would be yeah .
D :  I think it's the most easier thing , yeah .
C :  That's my uh
A :  And hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive .
D :  No .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well we had twelve fifty , I guess , for uh production ? Yeah . I dunno how expensive an L_C_D_ screen is .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Twelve fifty .
C :  Um .
B :  Any guesses ?
C :  Well I suppose wi if the mar if our um
C :  if the i if the young people are interested in L_C_D_ screens , we should make 'em . And if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls
D :  Highly .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . But
B :  But he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , but also on the older , and will they use it if it only has an L_C_D_ screen ?
D :  Yeah , but
D :  Um , s forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . But our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty .
B :  Oh , so still a little bit people
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah that's right . But you don't want to alienate the other uh
D :  No , that not now , but , so
B :  But if they also buy it then it's alright .
B :  I guess .
D :  Yeah , but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Alright .
A :  Okay , so L_C_D_ it is ?
B :  An Yes .
C :  Mm . It's treasure . I hope we uh h and let's hope to reach those uh those sales .
A :  Okay .
A :  And what else ?
D :  Yeah , i i if it Yeah , if it costs gets too much , too expensive , then yeah , we should be sticking to rubber buttons .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , can you um uh s I think that that they will send you some information about uh the cost of L_C_D_ uh screens .
D :  N nothing , no costs at all .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But perhaps later , so uh
C :  Uh so if you uh Yeah , so if you uh you receive an email about that , uh can you post it in the or shouldn't we post that in uh our projects mail uh folder .
D :  Yeah , in
D :  I think that should yeah I think we all get the costs of everything .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I don't
C :  Because you are the the Marketing uh Expert .
D :  Yeah , okay , I'll I'll post it .
C :  I uh
B :  Well perhaps we should have a backup plan that we would use buttons if it's uh too expensive .
C :  Yeah sure , sure .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay . But for now it's L_C_D_ . Okay .
D :  Okay , L_C_D_ , yeah . Then you have the seventy five percent of users find it r ugly .
B :  Yeah .
B :  The L_C_D_ ? Oh that's a bit of a problem .
D :  Yeah , and eighty percent of the users would spend more money with a when a remote would look fancy .
B :  Oh , that's a bit of a problem .
C :  Mm .
D :  Tha i l i it'll look fancy with L_C_D_ screen . Yeah .
C :  It's looks fancy one yeah , of L_C_D_ screen .
B :  Yeah , but they don't they don't like it . They think it's ugly . When it has an L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , just a the plain remotes , not not specific L_C_D_ remotes .
B :  Oh , alright , I thought that you said that .
D :  So
A :  Yeah , and maybe you can make something fancy out of an L_C_D_ remote , because it's new , as far as I know .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm yeah .
D :  Yeah , of course .
C :  And then not yeah .
D :  And then you have the other thing , that seventy five percent zap a lot , but that's not a f question with the L_C_D_ screen . Only thing you have to do is wipe the screen off once each time , to get all the fingerprints off it .
C :  Um .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm . Okay ?
A :  Okay , what else does our remote need ?
B :  A mute button .
D :  Um
A :  Mute button .
D :  Mm-hmm . The most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection ,
B :  I think . And
C :  Yeah .
D :  and power s power usage .
B :  Yeah .
D :  And a teletext , but that is not of the question . Other things are
B :  But
B :  But shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ?
D :  Sorry ?
D :  Yeah , it could be .
B :  Remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah , and we could make an a a separate menu on the L_C_D_ uh screen for teletext .
D :  Yeah , teletext .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And there's also a
D :  And other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , but
B :  Yeah , they are less important , but I think they should be there , or not ?
D :  Less important . Yeah , should be there , but not press Yeah , sub-menu , yeah .
C :  A sh but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . Uh I think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in English , uh ,
C :  to not use batteries , and use ac uh bat uh batteries to uh to be yeah yeah sure . Indeed . So uh you can mount uh the the the uh
B :  Like with a with a mouse , you have not , yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , in a breath it's
C :  uh the remote control to um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Charted .
B :  We should think of the twelve fifty we have but
C :  to refill the
D :  Yeah , but we don't we don't have any costs now , so Yeah .
B :  I don't know how much that's going to uh
C :  Yeah . Okay , because i uh when you get an L_C_D_ screen , you run it on batteries , the batteries will be uh empty very soon , very fast .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah e e power supply is one of the most important things .
B :  You should Perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . If you have an L_C_D_ screen that's burns all the time I dunno .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
B :  You shouldn't on and off because that's ver extra , that you have t first you have to turn the remote on , and then you can uh I don't know .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh
D :  Yeah , I think it's it's not that easy because I don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it , so I think it's better when th the T_V_ shuts down , the remote shuts down .
B :  Nee that's that's uh yeah .
B :  But then you can't
C :  And go to standby mode when you don't use it , so that
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah yeah au automac matically , that it yeah .
C :  Yeah , automatically . After two minutes or three minutes , something like that .
D :  Yeah . After two minutes , yeah two three minutes , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . And maybe a low battery indicator ? On the screen .
C :  Yeah . Sure .
D :  Yeah . And then b that uh before an hour when its get again gets empty . Then you have plenty of time to recharge it , of put it in a recharger . Charger .
B : 
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  So we are going for the for the recharger .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , if it's .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh .
B :  If it's sensible .
D :  Yeah , because when you're watching T_V_ , you're zapping and you have to put it in a recharger , and I don't think it
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , b when the batteries are low
C :  No , when you when you're done with s uh w uh watching your television , you have to put it
D :  Yeah , okay , but then we have to be sure that the the the the batteries go hours , six hours , five , six hours , then .
C :  Yeah sure , of course .
B :  But you'll also forget to put it in , because you throw it on the couch and you don't remember .
D :  Yeah , then you have a problem .
C :  Yeah , but
C :  But you also forget to buy batteries , and then you can you can't use it , so I
B :  Yeah . That's right .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Or we have to be sure that the batteries last couple of days when they're recharged .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So .
B :  Well I think the batteries should should w should work a lot longer than a couple of days , or not ? 'Cause
D :  Yeah because you have b but you have L_C_D_ screen .
B :  Yeah , that's right , but
D :  High power usage .
C :  High power user cell , i
C :  uh it should be uh a standard move to to put your remote control in the charger when you're done watching television , that's also a a a great advantage because you can't lose it anymore . Because you are obliged to uh put it in the charger and not to uh leave it in a couch uh between some cushions .
D :  Yes .
D :  True .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  True .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
C :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , you made a point there .
B :  But then you also have to s have somewhere where you can put a remo recharger near your couch because otherwise you have to walk a long way when you twoft want to turn on the T_V_ .
A :  Yeah , also .
D :  Yeah , otherwise all your yeah .
D :  Just a small device . Plug it in , that's it . Yeah , like a like telephone charger or something .
C :  Yeah it hasn't It doesn't have to be big .
B :  Yeah . I think everything has it for and I guess .
C :  Yeah just just a cable , or a even a a a a a charger where you can mount it on . Something like that , just u
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Alright .
A :  Okay , well I've
D :  It has to be easy to use also , or things . Uh market share , speaker re speech recognition .
A :  Yeah , you have some more
A :  points .
D :  I think .
C :  Functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points uh , or
D :  Also .
D :  Well I think that this should be standard . Large button large buttons . Yeah ? Okay .
C :  Yeah but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify .
C :  Because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen , but the elderly only look at two buttons . Okay .
D :  .
A :  And you said something about speech recognition ?
D :  Yeah , it says also Yeah .
C :  Speech recognition ? Hello . Twelve Euro twelve Euro fifty .
B :  Yeah , twelve fifty , twelve fifty .
D :  Twelve . That's an also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent .
B :  So it's pretty big .
C :  Well , spread it by a big market .
D :  But then I I I
A :  Even bigger than for L_C_D_ .
B :  Yeah . W I know let's do a speech .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well let's leave out all the remote controls and just put a microphone on top of the television to
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Ninety . Twenty five .
B :  You can clap or something .
C :  Yeah Yeah .
D :  channel .
C :  Turn volume up .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hey , that that's an idea .
D : 
B :  Now you shouldn't say the wrong thing , I dunno .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , well that should it has to be remote control , not
D :  Yeah , twelve .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , or ?
D :  Yeah . Is this only would you would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . It's the only thing it says .
C :  Sure why not why not
C :  Yeah , mm .
B :  Oh , but do we want to implement that , or ?
D :  I think an L_C_D_ screen should be suf sufficient .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But when you look at the percentages
D :  Yeah , it says a lot , but
C :  Perhaps the options should be uh
A :  Speech recognition scores even higher , huh ?
C :  Why not ?
A :  Yeah , well , maybe because of the cost , but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh .
C :  Why not ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Let's hope uh to have some uh d
B :  I know
D :  No I think I think it's better to have L_ L_C_D_ screen , because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , and fifty five of those people want L_C_D_ screen and thirty five want speech recognition . So I think it's better to keep it with L_C_D_ screen .
A :  But would it be useful to imple implement both ?
B :  Mm .
A :  On one remote ? Or
D :  Yeah , if the costs al allow it .
B :  Well
A :  Yeah , I dunno .
B :  I don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty . With that uh
D :  Nee .
D :  If it should be done , if it could be done , I won't matter . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but how would you like to implement that , that you say volume up , and then it goes up , or ?
C :  We should do it . Yeah . Sure .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Uh .
C :  Certain systems already exist , I think .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Then you also have to have different languages if we go international . Then uh it's y it's yours to do a French and Dutch and English and
D :  True .
C :  True , yeah .
D :  Yeah . True .
C :  Yeah .
D :  But that should also be with f should be also with L_C_D_ screen . Because then I think in Chinese is different written , volume is different written than um Swahili or something .
C :  This should be uh accommodated with some software , uh , uh . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's right .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Right .
C :  Swahili . Swahili .
B :  Yeah you can use icons for the
C :  Yeah .
D :  Ja , well possible .
B :  a speaker and uh
C :  Indeed .
B :  But if that's better than language for the for the remote .
D :  Yeah , yeah yeah yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay .
B :  Then it's Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  'Kay , what else ?
A :  So , no speech recognition ? Or
B :  Well , if it could be done , we
A : 
D :  Yeah , we have to keep Yeah .
C :  Y it should be done . If it could be done , should be done .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , and then we have different languages .
B :  Yeah , that should be uh anything matters .
C :  That's not so difficult at all , because I already use on several voice operated systems , and they are all possible to uh not all , but
A :  Okay , just make a separate remote for each uh
B :  Well , you sh you should to adjust the thing .
D :  I think it's difficult .
D :  Every language of dialects
B :  Yeah .
D :  I think it's very differen difficult .
B :  And you have to speak the so that it can understand .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I think it can't be implemented , but maybe
B :  You could use that n as an option , if you have money left , or something .
D :  Yeah , 's an option , yes .
C :  Yeah , sure , indeed .
D :  Fifty Euro cents .
B :  Yeah . Let's do speech .
C :  For speech recognition .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so we only do this when we have enough money left . Okay . Well I've written down an an on or off button , volume selection , channel selection , uh the digits from one to zero , huh . Um or from zero to nine . Uh a digits button to switch uh between one and two digits , mute button , a separate menu for teletext , a battery indicator . Um we're going to use a docking station and uh probably L_C_D_ and if there's enough money , speech recognition . And uh the possibility to uh enlarge buttons or to have large buttons
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm , yes .
B :  Yeah . I With uh teletext if it wasn't ver very important , it was but You also now have colours . I don't know if we should implement that . Yeah , when you press the red button , you go to page one hundred two , and when you press the
A :  in general .
D :  No , but
D :  Curved ?
C :  Uh yeah .
B :  I don't know if we should implement that , because it says that teletext not really important , but yeah , the shortcut , and you can't go to sport .
D :  Um .
C :  S Shortcuts . Uh .
D :  I think we should we could that we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  D Mainly if you turn the uh remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . And if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it . It should be available but not
C :  Sh Yeah , just just sub-menu . Yeah . Not directly uh available . Okay .
B :  'Cause it should be there .
D :  not Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , and
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  So actually it is there but it's just not r ready there .
D :  Yeah , but s
C :  Directly available . So does it confuse uh the user ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  You'll have to search for it .
D :  They'd have to be easy to use .
C :  Uh . I'll search um .
C :  If you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's a
D :  The sign of it .
A :  Okay , but no more buttons or functions , or ?
D :  Uh , no . What else can you do with a television ?
B :  I guess not .
C :  No .
B :  We've got anon
A :  Aren't we forgetting something very important ?
B :  Have got got two examples here , but I don't think there's anything we're missing .
D :  Uh play , pause , doesn't n need to be there .
B :  Well , we don't have the video orders
D :  Yes , so this is your presentation .
D :  We could check the other remote controls with technical functions .
B :  Yeah , you could look here all the the
D :  Which ones were yours ?
B :  Uh th th th th I don't know , technical functions . They're a bit small , you can we should stretch them , because
A :  Ping .
D :  Ja ja ja ja ja . Technical functions . Yeah okay .
B :  I guess we've got them all .
D :  Uh I think I go to have volume , mute but I Yeah .
D :  Very slow . Yeah , the zoom buttons .
B :  And for a T_V_ ? Can you zoom in a T_V_ ?
D :  Yeah , b wide screen , high screen , different things you have , yeah different uh Yeah .
B :  Or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and yeah . But that should also be a sub then , a sub uh menu thing .
C :  Menu .
D :  Yeah it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something .
B :  Yeah , so we should also implement se screen settings .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , screen settings , audio settings , teletext settings you have .
B :  Oh right .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Channel settings .
B :  Yeah , so you can program the
D :  So those four , and of course the main .
B :  Yeah , so the first you see the main , and the other ones you can uh go to uh
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Like tap screens or something or , I dunno .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Something
B :  I hope we can do this .
C :  There are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got . 'Cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the uh the screen settings uh for uh
D :  Yeah , if uh
D :  No , you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't then you don't use it .
C :  Yeah and if the television does not support such uh operations
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We don't have to use that top . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . So you leave it alone . Yeah . Or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  And do we want them in different colours , or
D :  Yeah .
B :  And and the buttons , should they have colours ?
D :  Colours . Yeah .
C :  Colours I think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the L_C_D_ screen . I Because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g
B :  Oh but we don't have any buttons .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , then defines itself .
D :  Because uh how many percent ? Eighty percent ?
B :  They think it's ugly , right ?
D :  Would spend more money if it looks fancy .
C :  Okay , so use uh very uh lot of peo
B :  Perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones . You can uh But I don't think that uh
C :  Adjust with phones , yes
C :  Okay . Twelve Euro fifty .
C :  Well , make it available in different colours , you mean ? Sure .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Red , white , blue , black .
D :  Rasta colours .
A :  And a see-through uh
C :  Grey . Yeah sea view , yes , Simpson's versions and
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , see through version . Yeah .
D :  If you press a button , it turns green .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , well that's the
C :  Leave .
B :  A disco version .
A :  signal for las final five minutes . Um so I have uh the things I just read . Um then we have uh separate menus for teletext , screen settings , audio settings , and what else ?
B :  Five minutes ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Channel settings ?
B :  Oh yeah , right . So you can program the T_V_ .
A :  Channel settings .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
B :  Perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile . So , options , and then you sub them . Otherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not , but
D :  Yeah . Could be possible .
C :  Mm .
D :  Or like uh you have a menu button , you press Yeah , or otherwise you have a menu button , press menu then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings .
A :  No , we said teletext also a separate menu .
B :  Yeah , but I
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . But
A :  Okay , but we can work that out later , I guess . So we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? Like uh large icons or small icons and
D :  Yeah , no problem . Yep .
B :  I don't know .
A :  I don't know what else , but
D :  Um , I think b because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen , I think the buttons Yeah , but but or like you have you only have channel button or volume button . Those buttons you can you can
C :  No .
B :  Or do we have any buttons ? On the remote .
B :  Which one ?
B :  But that's also in the L_C_D_ , right ?
A :  Yeah , but on the L_C_D_ , huh ?
D :  Yeah . Yeah , th
A :  Right , yeah , okay .
B :  So we don't have any normal buttons that uh No , alright .
D :  No , no normal buttons , yeah . Maybe only the on and o on and off button . But I don't think
B :  Yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno
A :  But we don't need a special we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself .
C :  Uh not button
D :  Mm , no .
B :  No , no .
A :  Okay .
B :  Oh well , you should be able to set which T_V_ you have .
B :  If you have if you have uh
C :  Yeah sure , of course you need uh a settings button , uh or a settings option for the remote control .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the T_V_ , that you don't have to use a
D :  No no no , because we we discussed that you could charge it , otherwise is it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically .
B :  Yeah but but not for the remote but for the T_V_ , that you use
D :  Yeah , but a T_V_ of course , th that's the I think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . No .
B :  But a not as normal button , in the L_C_D_ , yeah .
A :  Well maybe there should be a separate button apart from the L_C_D_ , because you can't turn it on when the L_C_D_ is off . So how do you turn the thing on ? There has to be a on button on the remote , huh ?
B :  No you just tap I think .
D :  Yeah , you tap . Touch screen , yeah then it's turn turn off , turn on .
C :  Just tap it .
A :  Tap the thing . Okay . And then the television is on also , or just the remote ? Sure .
D :  No , just the remote . A television don't have to be on , that one you can press on , yeah stand-by , then press on remote , press on and then T_V_ should be available . Or not .
B :  But
C :  Yeah , it should be in standby mode , but
B :  Yeah a yeah . I don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button , a r just uh rubber uh for for T_V_ , so you can turn it on and then you can choose the channel . Otherwise you I don't know whether or not that's
D :  Separate .
C :  A A A normal button on the remote control , or norm ?
B :  Yeah , yeah . To turn it on .
B :  Of or you should put it in the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Yeah , because uh when you touch the L_C_D_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on .
B :  Yeah , I have , yeah .
A :  Okay , well
C :  Wh uh why would it be a a need to have a normal button ?
B :  Well I I guess if you use the L_C_D_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , then you uh you you then turn it , and then the T_V_ goes on . But if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , and then you search the channel which you want .
D :  Yeah , but I think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button .
C :  Mm .
B :  Oh right .
C :  I think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control .
B :  Yeah , I think so too . Otherwise y wet e k Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . No buttons at all . Okay , well that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . Okay , well I guess we have to
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  If we can afford it .
D :  Yeah , if we can afford it . Yeah .
C :  Oh , okay
A :  postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , because we're running out of time . Um for now , we're having a lunch break ,
C :  Oh .
A :  and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work . I will uh write uh minutes , if I can create them out of this . And uh put them in the the project documents uh folder . And here are the individual actions for the for the other roles . And of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach .
C :  Mm .
B :  Alright .
A :  Luckily as we are . Okay , well thank you very much , for now , and uh have a nice lunch , huh ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Lunch .
C :  Okay . Food .
B :  Should we put this back in our rooms , or uh ?
C :  Yeah , think so .
B :  Yeah .
C :  .
B :  Hello .
B :  'Kay .
A :  You all saw the newsflash ? Or you got the same message ?
C :  It's
D :  Yeah I I just saw it one minute ago . When I uh
A :  Yeah sorry .
C :  I don't know . I didn't see it yet I think .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Newsflash ? D did I miss something ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah I received an email so I thought I I can't mail you so I thought I'd just drop it in the folder , but
D :  Yeah pretty much .
C :  Hey what's wrong with my computer ?
B :  Okay .
A :  Is it unlocked ?
D :  Mm .
B :  No .
C :  .
D :  Yeah that's my presentation .
A :  Woah . I uh kind of opened it .
C :  Huh ?
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm ? Oh right .
C :  What the
A :  Uh
B :  I think you have to uh change your desktop uh
A :  Okay .
B :  size .
D :  Ooh .
A :  'Kay . Everybody ready ?
C :  Not really . Sorry .
D :  Well
B :  computer is uh not functioning ?
A :  No no no . Yes yes yes .
D :  Alright .
C :  Okay . Where do I find this ? I'm not so g display huh ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh display .
B :  And then uh settings ?
C :  Appearance ?
D :  Huh .
B :  Mm I'm not sure I .
D :  You read the newsflash ?
B :  No .
A :  'Kay . Can we get started or is there some pressing issue ?
C :  No what was it about ?
D :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah my computer is not functioning properly .
A :  Oh no pressing . Did you plug in the power cable when you come back ?
C :  Yeah yeah . No but my screen is reduced in size .
A :  Yeah . That's difficult . Yeah .
D :  What ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Feedback .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
D :  alt delete .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Format .
A :  Format save .
D :  .
D :  So it doesn't draw the attention away .
C :  This is dreadful .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I made uh uh my own map .
C :  No not this , but the task . Yeah . No that's okay . No I just flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened .
A :  Oh yeah sure . You have Playstation also ?
B :  It's a
B :  Yeah .
C :  Ah . Uh where was it ? In settings ?
C :  Okay . Alright . Thank you . Do you guys like your tasks ?
A :  Huh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I spent a lot of time thinking about what I was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this I get my function you know the information that I need . So frustrating . So
B :  Yeah wa wa you actually
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation .
D :  Yeah . I I had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh . I have to do that so switch .
C :  Yeah
C :  Yeah exactly . This presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause I hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Really annoying .
A :  Okay . So there we are again .
D :  By your humble P_M_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay this is the agenda . Um we have three presentations , I heard .
B :  Really .
A :  Yeah really . So who wants to start ?
D :  Yeah that's fine .
C :  Yeah .
D :  We have to start it right away ?
A :  Yeah . Uh this is you ?
D :  Functional ? Yeah functional requirements .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Alright .
D :  I'm gonna talk about functional requirements . Um
D :  Well uh some research has be done uh has been done . Uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . Uh and they also filled in a questionnaire .
D :  The findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . They disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . Users think they're ugly . Um they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . So they they d they don't match what they want to have on it .
D :  Um they are often lost somewhere in the room . Um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . And they're bad for R_S_I_ . I don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay .
D :  Um there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions . Uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , uh pitch , bass . Um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that . Um but they are used . I mean the
C :  So they do need to be in the
D :  Yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control . I mean if you can't control the the sound settings I mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something , you you need to change that . So um yeah we have to . We c we c
A :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
A :  often .
C :  By the way my T_V_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but okay .
D :  Yeah I mean w we can't my my T_V_ has , but we we can leave them uh away . Uh most relevant , uh most used functions , uh they speak for themselves I guess . Uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . Uh teletext but we can skip that because I saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future . So forget this one . Uh channel settings , so for programming uh your channels in in the right order .
A :  Next generation does .
C :  No . Alright .
A :  N not used anymore .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  By the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? I didn't get anything .
B :  Yeah . I was wondering uh
D :  Yeah , on on the project uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  Not by mail . I receiv the mail but you don't . So
D :  No so it's a text file n in the project folder . So teletext can be skipped .
B :  But you you've got more information than uh .
A :  That's in the presentation , so
C :  Alright .
D :  Um there was some research on new features in a remote control . Uh about an L_C_D_ screen uh and speech recognition . Well we got an update for the for the audience . Or the the the targeted group . So it's above forty I guess .
A :  Uh below I believe . Yeah below forty .
D :  The new product ? Or below because that's pretty relevant .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I thought I read a
A :  Our current customers are in the age group forty plus . And the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty .
D :  Yeah ?
D :  Below ? Okay well that's that's in the newsfla okay that's a good to know . Um because you see see a clear distinction between the age groups , concerning the features . I mean uh above forty people are not so interested uh not so interested in a screen or speech recognition . Uh but below that age they uh they pretty much are . So I think we can build that in . Um
B :  But where did you get uh that information ?
A :  That's in a newsflash .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
D :  Yeah well we can skip this part as well , because I thought I read above forty so we could skip the features , but we just have to build them in because uh they find it very interesting .
D :  Um well we have to keep all the classic functions but make the buttons as user-friendly as possible . Um and and also there's so not only the design of the bus uh buttons but o how you can push them , and stuff like that . So the physical uh aspect of it . Um
D :  And I think and certainly for for the for the lower age groups , uh nice design , which uh does not make the remote control in your room . It's it's actually a part of your interior , of of your design in your room . So it's the people can say , well what's that , well that's my remote control , so it's d it has to look nice and feel nice , and and have all the functions that uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But it also needs to have corporate identity .
D :  Yeah so the the logo has to be uh present yeah , and the colours as well .
A :  Present and the colours .
A :  So we can't change much of that .
C :  Do we have uh yeah .
D :  Yeah so but I I don't think that's that's a problem because the thing has to have a colour anyway , and most of the times there is a brand present on it . So I think that's not gonna gonna affect it very uh very much . Well that are the the consequences uh on a marketing uh part .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Alright .
D :  Yes .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Okay .
A :  It's open already so you can use to
D :  .
B :  Mm .
A :  find yours .
B :  It's
A :  F_ five .
B :  F_ five .
B :  Okay .
A :  Go Jurgen . You pressed alt F_ four ?
B :  Oh .
B :  What is this ? Oh no .
B :  How do I uh
B :  No no no . I pressed the mouse button .
A :  Oh great .
C :  It's th that's the self-destruct button .
A :  Yeah . Uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it .
B :  Yeah . Okay .
B :  Okay . Um if you all go stand around uh
D :  Yeah . Just yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Sure .
B :  Computer
C :  Alright .
B :  Um
A :  That's nice .
B :  No .
A :  F_ five . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Alright .
B :  Okay .
B :  I uh had uh two examples . Um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . This the easy one I think we have to to combine them . And uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um but yeah the the age is uh under forty ? So we
A :  The mm yeah .
D :  Yeah and and and marketing research stated that that that kind of users are not afraid of of a lot of functions . So not not too much but yeah .
B :  Okay so so we have the option for more functions . Um yeah .
C :  And we do have to integrate the screen and the the speech alright .
D :  And the speech recognition yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh yeah this this one we can remove for kids . It's just only for adults so uh we can uh use some advanced options . But
D :  Yeah from age of sixteen so yeah .
B :  Yeah but I prefer we we uh use the the basic options uh yeah . We have to to make them very easy so for just uh zapping around the channels you can just push one button . But if you want to to use your your video recorder or something else , you should use use an uh an advanced option .
D :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah but uh the the newsflash also stated that it should control only one device , only your television . So w
B :  Okay one device . Okay . I didn't see . Okay and I also uh yeah . W yeah . We have to make it fashionable . Like you uh said uh before .
A :  Yeah . So n it's very easy . Now yeah it's okay .
D :  So there are not extra options in this case , but uh
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh yeah the basic functions . Um yeah only use a extra function if they are really needed .
A :  Yeah so maybe you can hide them or something .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah well what what we can do with the screen is is all the the configuration options , you can put that in the screen . And the and the yeah screen menu to to to uh to do that , and then the basic function just on the device itself . So it looks very simple and all the advanced features are hidden in the screen , uh with a clear menu .
A :  Yeah you make a screen menu or something .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah and the other oth other uh functionality is the screen . What does the screen do ?
B :  Did I uh did I break it ?
D :  Uh . What are wh
C :  Alright .
A :  Yeah . It's low power .
D :  What .
A :  So what does the screen do ? They said they needed it but what does it do ? What do they want with the screen ?
B :  For for the advanced functions I think .
D :  Yeah well it yeah it didn't it didn't say what they want to do with the screen . Well I , my guess is it's it's pretty handy for advanced uh advanced functions .
A :  Yeah that's what we make it up . So but what did the marketing
A :  No .
A :  Yeah okay it's handy . With no predefined uh
B :  Like searching for channels and
D :  Yeah searching for channels , programming them .
C :  Ah look .
C :  We have your uh oh never mind .
B :  Yeah .
A :  We're back online .
B :  Okay . That's uh I'm al I'm almost finished so
A :  Okay .
B :  Um the we have to to to watch out for the i if we make it f very fashionable , it it the functional functionality will go down . So we have to make uh a compromise between functionality and fashional fashionable yeah content and form . Now that that was uh was the end . Yes .
A :  Mm-hmm . Content and form .
D :  Yeah .
C :  .
A :  Yeah . That was the end . Okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Well my presentation is a bit uh sucky .
D :  Well you can improvise right ?
A :  Uh which one is it ? Technical functions ?
C :  Yeah a little bit . Uh no .
A :  This one ?
C :  No no .
A :  Functional requirements ?
C :  Yeah I think that would be it then .
A :  No .
D :  So we we can go for
C :  I have no idea .
A :  You didn't put it in ? Or
C :  That w . Let me check .
A :  it's not really English .
C :  I know .
A :  Uh kick off . Oh working design I got it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it .
A :  Here you go .
C :  Alright how do I uh skip pages ?
A :  Just uh press uh yeah . Yeah .
C :  The keys yeah ? Alright . Um yeah well I was working on this before I got my information . So I was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And well the info on the website which came too late . Um so I didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet . So uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting . Those were my uh starting points .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh I was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and I was supposed to do it like this . But um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that I had to follow , so I was trying to organise them for myself . And then make the the design , a the actual design , but I never came around to do that . So I'm not really sure what I'm supposed to say about it .
A :  Mm .
D :  Design ? Yeah .
A :  Design yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  I mean everything speaks for itself I guess . Mean you press a button um the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . And uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . And then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the T_V_ and the T_V_ will translate it into a function . Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah frequency . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah decoder .
C :  Yeah well this was
C :  actually all I got around to do . I mean I dunno if I'm too slow for this stuff , but uh
A :  Blank . Yeah okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Work harder .
B :  Okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh
C :  Yeah . Whatever .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it .
A :  Uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay . Um for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for T_V_ . Uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , but I don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well .
D :  Mm .
A :  And uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control .
A :  And we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group . We have to make be clear what that is .
D :  group of users , or because it says below forty I mean . I guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female
A :  Yeah users .
A :  Yeah so I think it's easy but
B :  But uh it's it's also for children or just uh
D :  Uh six the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen . Sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that . So um
A :  Yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  So below forty is okay . But we need an lower level which to s uh focus . So is it from sixteen to forty ? Is it from twenty to forty ? Is it from thirty ? Yeah ? 'Kay .
D :  How do you mean ?
D :  Uh sixteen to forty . Well I I guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology . So they they adapt to it pretty soon I guess .
B :  Yeah . We we have to
A :  Yeah .
B :  And if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust I have customised the screen functions , if you know what I mean . The uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . But maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . And yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Design . Mm .
B :  Yeah that's that's why uh I wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . The the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And maybe y
C :  Experienced yeah .
D :  But uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ?
B :  I w I should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display .
D :  Yeah like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  So is you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are
D :  Uh you can make a if you make a drawing . Uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Aye yeah .
D :  Uh .
A :  Shall I uh
D :  Uh black's okay .
D :  And draw it very big . Oh . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . It's okay .
A :  no , it doesn't have line control , so
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah we get the
D :  Yeah well , this is basically uh it's alright the remote ? Um well usually the power button is on top I guess .
C :  The remote ?
A :  The remote , yeah ?
A :  Basic .
A :  Is on top .
A :  Which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb .
D :  Yeah so it should fit right in into your hand .
B :  Yeah . L left top or right uh top ?
A :  T I s should said right . Because yeah .
D :  Right . Right . I most people are right-handed so maybe left-handed special addition , but okay . If you put it like like here . Or something . I dunno .
C :  Right top .
B :  Yeah , right .
C :  Yeah definitely .
B :  Okay .
D :  Um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top I guess .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u yeah .
A :  Do the also with the thumb . So it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . Or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly .
D :  Okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . Okay for example if you put the screen here , it's more about the functions now than the than the layout .
A :  You you need to be able to hold it so
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah okay that's true . Layout . That's for the
D :  Doesn't work too well . It's uh it's bent .
A :  I can't help it .
D :  .
B :  You broke it .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  .
A :  Man .
D :  Right .
A :  Yeah okay .
D :  Okay you get it . Uh for example if y if you put all the
D :  Right .
A :  You want the normal piece of paper ? And you have a pen ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  And might be easier huh ?
D :  Maybe this . kind of works .
A :  Yeah ?
D :  Like if you have
D :  like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels , um and here one for for
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh . And the for flipping up and down .
B :  Yeah yeah . And volume control .
D :  Yeah that that usually uh like here , here , here , here . So you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume uh
C :  Yeah I
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And left to right .
A :  And those can also be used for the menu .
C :  Yeah exactly . I thought but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things
D :  And you you have most of the time you have one button in the middle . It says menu , and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon and then just mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to to confirm a a kind of action . So you scroll into it , okay . You select a function like v like uh bass .
C :  And
C :  Yeah okay .
A :  For the menu . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  You just adjust it with these two buttons . Then okay to confirm , and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . And then finally say okay , exit . Or or one button to exit it .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh in one time I dunno , that's not really my department . That's more your uh your department to to uh to
B :  And do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or
D :  Yeah . But it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top , yeah . I mean it's uh
A :  Yeah .
B :  On the left uh top yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah but that depends on where you put the screen . But it's essential that there is a screen .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah I mean the position of the screen is also more essential than I mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . But um
A :  Yeah .
A :  And for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone .
D :  Yeah so it should be I mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe . I mean i
A :  Yeah . This would be uh
C :  Why did we wanna put the display in the bottom ?
A :  No that's not s sure so uh we need a display .
D :  That's not sure but it's
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah may maybe because you're
C :  Because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display .
B :  Yeah okay but only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then yeah .
D :  Yeah I mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . Also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . So you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . I mean if you grab it . But most most of the times if a if if a T_V_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on . So we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo
C :  Normal for logical t
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah they're used to it .
B :  Okay the yeah . That's possible .
C :  Yeah .
C :  On once it's on it's on . You don't need the power button .
B :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Okay we put it on top .
B :  Yeah .
D :  like over here . R_R_ . And j and the microphone , I mean it can be very small . If you look at your mobile phones are some stripes , little little holes .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Maybe on the top or even on the side .
D :  Yeah maybe on the side . I mean if the if the microphone is good .
A :  Yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so
C :  True .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah okay . So on the on the top is better .
A :  I think that top is the best option .
C :  But if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side I dunno . Should be able to work . Never mind .
A :  Yeah okay .
D :  Yeah . .
A :  Depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but I think that's okay .
C :  Can we leave this up to you ?
D :  Yeah it doesn't matter that much . So but um the screen is on top ? Which functions did we have left ?
D :  I mean this is basically numbers , volume , uh channel up and down . Screen is over there .
A :  Volume .
A :  Up .
A :  Channel up and down , and the control of the advanced options .
B :  Yeah . If we
D :  Yeah .
A :  So maybe it , we should decide what advanced options we want to put in the L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Yeah . That's uh that's a good one .
C :  Yeah so we we needed to integrate the sound and uh
C :  and image options right ? Like uh bass uh so we need kind of an equaliser . If you
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah so sounds ?
D :  Sound ?
D :  Yeah . Equaliser . So if you have sound
D :  But not too advanced . I mean most T_V_s use only treble and bass .
B :  Yeah it it's just a remote control so
A :  Yeah and they're
C :  Yeah treble , middl middle , bass or something .
A :  They're not used often so
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . It's uh pretty hard to write . Mm . Okay but you have sound ?
C :  Ah as
A :  Yeah just
C :  .
A :  Yeah sounds .
D :  Yeah just oh y you have digital uh better write it down over there yeah . So you have sound .
A :  Yeah .
C :  .
A :  Of course . I'm just a secretary .
D :  Yeah . Uh yeah sound and then within sound I guess treble and bass ?
A :  Coffee ?
C :  Yes please .
A :  Treble bass .
C :  the mono stereo option ? And there there was something else also . And then pitch .
D :  Yeah . Also .
A :  Uh
A :  Pitch I believe , yeah .
D :  Pitch . Yeah . But pitch , isn't that yeah that's the the height of the tone .
A :  Yeah .
C :  The fr yeah the frequency of the tones , yeah .
D :  Yeah okay , wh why would you use that ? If people like talk like uh
A :  Yeah and mono stereo .
C :  Yeah isn't that that depends on the on the signal of the of what program you're watching .
A :  Mm . And also the tuning part ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Programming part .
A :  Yeah programming . So channel programming ?
D :  Uh so we have sound , yeah ? Channel programming .
C :  And yeah in the functionality of the
B :  Television uh itself uh
C :  no no of the remote uh do do we want uh the buttons to make sound when you press them ? As a confirmation or whatever you know ? I dunno .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm . I think it g it gets annoying . I mean most mobile phones used that in the beginning but
A :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  We we could make an option for it , but uh you can disable s
C :  Under the a yeah advanced option menu you can put those things .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But uh the the television itself has also the the options brightness and uh screen colour etcetera . So yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Contrast yeah .
D :  Yeah but people don't want to sit on their knees on their knees in front of their television with only three buttons then it's very hard to y yeah contrast and brightness ?
A :  Mm . No .
A :  Uh , so contrast ,
C :  Yeah .
A :  bright ,
D :  Yeah those are the most used I guess . If you look at your monitor .
A :  uh
A :  And the others were in your presentation right ? So I can just copy those ?
D :  Well yeah well I guess that these were the only ones , I guess .
A :  Okay . It's easy .
D :  Yeah . I will look it up .
C :  But so we have we have T_V_ options , which is all this . The sound , sound and image . And you have in that uh the indeed the remote control options . So we need two menus kind of thing .
A :  Yeah the button options and the L_C_D_ options .
A :  Indeed . Yeah .
A :  Yeah you have basically a button menu , which you can use directly , uh according to the old principle . And the L_C_D_ options are activated by some some software options , thats communicates with the infrared uh decoder yeah .
C :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah with the chip and then I mean
A :  So you
D :  Uh yeah . Well yeah we have power button , whether that's present . Channel volume selection present . Uh numbers present . Yeah a audio settings , mono , stereo , pitch , bass , treble . Screen settings , brightness and colour .
A :  You have an additional processor and and software part .
C :  Alright .
A :  Compared to o
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  L_ s
A :  Yeah .
A :  Colour . Yeah I I call it contrast . Yeah I make it c colour .
D :  Yeah con contrast is
D :  Yeah okay , colour and brightness . Um and what you say , channel settings or channel programming ? So you you have an option to to start scanning all the frequencies , and when it encounters one , well it shows on your T_V_ . And then you can um
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah and automatically um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh and then you can select uh a number in your remote on which you want to save it .
A :  Yeah so I've g channel program is autoseek ?
D :  Yeah , autoseek .
A :  Uh name a channel , or
D :  Well most T_V_s automatically display the name , which they get through the cable .
A :  Oh they get automatic names , okay .
D :  Yeah . So you only have to choose the position on your
A :  .
D :  It only has to match the the channel frequency on your T_V_ , with with the with the position on your T_V_ and and so your remote .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah but can you also say I want f uh Veronica on the channel number uh five or
C :  Help .
D :  If you already programmed it . If you want to move it . Yeah that should be possible too . Yeah how do you call that ? Mm ?
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  How do you call that ?
D :  Wait you you should be able to to browse through a list or something , which w displays all the all the values , all the channels which are possible . I mean like one to f thirty of or ninety or whatever . Just browse through it and then um in some kind of way see if it if it if it is programmed .
A :  Channels ? Yeah .
A :  Ninety nine or something . Yeah .
A :  S swap channels ?
D :  Yeah . Swap channels .
A :  Can I call it that ?
A :  Swap's good option . Okay . Uh other functions ?
D :  So you most of the time if you if you swap it
D :  S uh let's say for example you have uh R_T_L_ five on on channel five . And Veronica on channel eight and you want to move Veronica to channel five , um most of the times you override the previous uh the previous one .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
A :  Well that's 's up to uh Mister User Interface Designer .
D :  Yeah . It's it's pretty uh yeah I mean you have to look on on the menu
B :  Okay .
C :  working design . Doch .
D :  on the T_V_ .
A :  Also . That's you're
C :  He only has to figure out how it has to look . And how
A :  Yeah but also , which buttons you have to press to get a certain result ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  to use
C :  Yeah okay . But
A :  And the working design was to specify how ph the physical interation between the components was , as I believe .
D :  Yeah .
C :  You did your homework . But um yeah . Okay .
D :  Or or is it too hard to to ju to just do it all on your remote ? To programme the channels ?
C :  No no . It should be able to do any remote .
A :  No I don't think so . But I think the communication with the television is difficult . But that's not our part . We don't have to design a protocol so
B :  No that's
D :  Uh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  No .
C :  No .
D :  That's true . That's true .
C :  Thank god .
D :  Yeah . So we have a figure a figure out a way to to do that easily . I mean th the autoseek is is not a problem . I mean you uh you uh current channel and then then it just says , uh on which number do you want to save this , and you just press a number on your remote , and then say confirm , okay , and then it's it's saved . It's easier , it's it's it's harder to , if you have already programmed it , to to swap . So we have to think of something for that .
B :  Okay
A :  No that's the
A :  Yeah .
A :  So but
A :  Um
A :  The User Interface Designer can design a menu
A :  for all these function I put them on the
D :  Yeah k kind of structure into layers .
B :  On the uh yeah can you i make a a map with with all the yeah 'cause it's now there are lots and lots of documents
A :  .
A :  Yeah . Yeah I can . I'll just try to reorganise uh things . Um
B :  and
D :  So
A :  So you design the basic function menu for the L_C_D_ screen ?
A :  Uh um
D :  And and the layout of of the thing itself .
A :  I think th I think the yeah the layout of the screen and I think you can concentrate more on the button placement and the placement of the uh screen itself on the
B :  The the layout of the remote control ?
D :  .
B :  Isn't that more the the u uh the user interface part ?
A :  .
A :  No I d I think that's more in
C :  Uh all the functional uh aspects of the remote I think are in my department . I have to know what it has to do , so if you wanna you know the changing the channels kind of s thing is , I have to integrate that in the design .
A :  .
D :  Maybe more on
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . So he's layout and you're function .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Form function okay .
D :  Okay .
C :  I think that's a that's a good separation .
B :  But do I have to to uh to yeah to make the the menu layout also ? Or
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  Are you going to do that ? Yeah ? I I'm going to make yeah o okay .
D :  Yeah . Yeah I guess so .
A :  I think i that's your department yes , because w he already knows what
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah we have to kind of work together . If if I make the the the yeah the menu like , I have to state which function has to be in the menu , and then you have to decide , it's , in a in a way that b is user-friendly .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But we're not allowed .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Y you you are going to make a list of what functions are uh are going to to be on the the screen , the menu screen . And I'm going to make a a nice menu uh with with pages and yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I think yeah .
D :  With with some l with some layers in it . So some menus .
A :  Yeah and also make clear which buttons to press to get certain result , because that's always the difficulty . Every device has its own
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Well I guess this this button , the the the okay , menu okay . Or you can incorporate two uh difference uh different buttons . Uh like uh for your mobile phone .
A :  Menu okay . Yeah .
D :  Um so this is only for to get in the menu , or to exit it . And then one to confirm , and one to go one step back . So it's like the the save button on your your mobile phone , if you have a Nokia or like that . Or the or the no button . To go one step back you it's only two extra buttons , but if it if it's very clear that they are for the screen
A :  Mm .
A :  Back . Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . W we
B :  Uh I think we have to to group , to make two groups . Um the one group for the for the display , and one group for the basic functions , and
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah but they're incorporated ? Up and down is
B :  Yeah okay but we we have a m yeah but maybe that's that's not uh yeah if you're if you're z zapping uh with your uh yeah remote control , you can press the the menu button , and then you are suddenly into the the yeah the display .
D :  Yeah because this this is used for both .
A :  Smart ?
D :  Into your screen . Okay . So you l should leave the menu button out of here . And and just put it under the screen , the screen
C :  You wanna separate uh .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Put it on top .
B :  Yeah j just just group group the yeah we make these the advanced functions and these the basic functions . So we make a yeah a line between them .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But we should place the screen on top , right ?
A :  Well
B :  F oh yeah . Okay yeah we swap uh Okay .
A :  But that's uh J Jurgen's department .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . So we make it a
D :  Yeah . You just you just find out and .
A :  You just make the layout . You do we do the extra two buttons or not ?
B :  Okay .
B :  Uh
C :  I think you should . It's easier . If you put too many functions in one button it gets confusing .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . So we have a a menu button and a s
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah okay . That's true .
A :  And to , okay and back , also .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , or confirm and back . Whatever .
B :  Okay . Okay and back button .
A :  And of course the four arrows .
D :  Yeah .
C :  No .
A :  But those are still y doubly used . Both the L_C_D_
D :  Should we save this picture , or or you know what it looks like ?
B :  Yeah I'm I'm not s clear about uh the the extra two buttons . We have a menu button and
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . That that just to to activate the screen . So
B :  That's the the one with the yeah okay .
A :  Menu button access the menu in the L_C_D_ screen .
D :  And then with these buttons , woa , y you navigate .
A :  You can navigate .
B :  Okay .
A :  But you can also navigate the channels . And the volume .
B :  Okay so that that's not uh Yeah that Those are
A :  Those are both both yeah .
B :  multifunctional .
C :  Hey is it interesting for users if we put LED lights under the buttons ? So that if you uh press on the menu function that only the buttons that are used for the menu are ligh li light up .
D :  Yeah .
D :  L l litten up yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  That's very good idea .
A :  Oh five minutes .
D :  Alright . Yeah that's a good idea because then it becomes clear which buttons are active now , which you can use .
A :  Light uh
C :  Yeah and then it's also easier to integrate several functions in one button .
A :  Yeah sure . Okay . Um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So
A :  Anything else ?
D :  Those buttons are are lit up . But just one thing . Should we use those two ? Them ? Or only this to to scroll ? And then use the two functional buttons to confirm , to go into something ?
C :  I think not .
A :  I've
D :  Oh no we have to use this to adjust some some bars ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Volume .
C :  Yeah keep it optional 'cause maybe you can you know go left to right and up and down in a in one menu .
D :  Yeah . And maybe we should use this also as an okay button , still . And then just only a back button .
A :  Well we have those buttons . We use all four .
C :  The pr the problem with the okay button in the middle is , sorry
B :  No
A :  Yeah okay go ahead .
D :  Yeah ?
C :  sorry , uh is uh if you're pressing up and down , you can easily press the okay once you , when you're not already at your choice .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So maybe make one uh one okay button and and one navigation button .
D :  And one back .
A :  Yeah that was already decided .
B :  Yeah the with with the the channel and the volume uh yeah m a multifunctional navigation button .
A :  Okay that's what we decided earlier on . Right okay . So yeah I wanna close down . I have to , sorry . it's not because I don't like you but yh we have lunch break , and then we can work for thirty minutes , and I have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes . And then uh we'll see
B :  Yeah okay . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  You wanna close down huh ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That's okay .
C :  Already .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Alright . How m how long is the lunchbreak ?
A :  I don't know .
D :  We have to ask .
A :  Nobody told me .
C :  Okay .
B :  But do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now ? Or first lunchbreak ? Because I
A :  No I th believe there's first lunch break .
B :  I've everything in my head now so
A :  Yeah . Or you can just
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  Yeah ?
A :  'Kay .
D :  Yes .
B :  'Kay .
A :  I think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and
C :  This is
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yes sir .
D :  Time pressure .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Yeah it's a lot of pressure .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh .
A :  That's okay .
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  Oh no no .
D :  Yeah we'll kick your ass later . No . Uh .
C :  Bring it on .
A :  I don't know if it works but it should be saved .
D :  Aye
D :  Y you saved it ? Does it save automatically in the project folder ? Or
A :  Yeah . It's uh
D :  Okay . We'll see . Just put back my laptop .
A :  Should be here . Smart board .
D :  Alright . Yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that .
A :  Don't know if you can use it but
B :  Okay .
B :  And uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered .
A :  Yeah . I try to organise it by these three .
B :  . It's it's just my own map so I put everything into the
A :  Yeah yeah yeah .
A :  I don't really mind . I just put the minutes here and we'll see .
B :  But you got some extra information uh
A :  Yeah that's in the functional design uh folder .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Yeah that's just basically what I just showed .
B :  But where do you did you get the newsflash ?
A :  Yeah . Yeah I got it by yeah .
B :  You're the only one uh okay .
A :  I'm gonna get kicked if I don't do it so
D :  internet .
C :  Alright .
B :  Okay .
D :  Alright .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Make me proud .
C :  I'll try to . So first we have a lunchbreak now ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
A :  I believe so .
A :  just ask .
C :  Mm-hmm . I dunno where she .
A :  Hello .
D :  Hey guys .
C :  Hi . I see my bunny is still standing . No one drawing it . Uh I figured uh that much .
B :  Hi .
A :  Hi .
A :  Yeah .
A :  It's too beautiful .
B :  Yeah , true .
D :  Too wicked .
B :  Mm .
A :  A minute please , my uh laptop is uh oh , there it is , thank you .
A :  So welcome back .
A :  At the functional design meeting um
A :  the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . I will uh take minutes and will put uh the minutes that I have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder . Also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , so you can read that uh now or afterwards . Um
A :  uh I had an email from the from the management board uh , I don't know if you a al also uh received it , but there were four points uh which uh I think are very important . First one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated uh and internet will be the the main uh focus . Uh second one is also important uh , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . Uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control , so uh that's one thing to keep in mind .
A :  Uh second , and I think that's important for the Marketing uh Expert , uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . Uh and uh I think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote . So , we have uh forty minutes , so I think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each , and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either SMARTboards , the the Word files , what you uh whatever you want . So uh
A :  Tim , can you start ?
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah ?
D :  'Kay , welcome . I have some uh new findings on uh Marketing Expert level ,
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  which I will show you .
D :  The method I used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire . Um one hundred respondents were involved
D :  and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results .
D :  Um ,
D :  these were a couple of findings , first page of three . Um ,
D :  we have three audiences of two audiences , I'm sorry . Uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . Uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five . Um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five . Uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent .
D :  Mm and some interests from the from the age groups , uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an L_C_D_ screen on the remote control , um
D :  speech recognition .
D :  I don't think that's uh really appropriate . Um , and when you see uh the audience ,
D :  the age is going up uh
D :  Yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies .
D :  Second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion
D :  the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . First point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy .
D :  So that's maybe something for the User Interface uh Designer .
D :  Okay , third findings . According to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um following buttons are most important . Um , I will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . Um , persons were asked
D :  uh what the buttons were uh they use most , how much an hour , and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . Um , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . Switching channels , um yeah ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  that's pretty uh
D :  pretty normal , that's what you do with a remote control . Um the second , teletext , uh and the third , uh volume controls . Um , I think it's good uh that we know what the user want wants , uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear .
A :  But it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet .
D :  Yeah , okay .
A :  So that that's strange .
D :  Yeah , okay , but uh at the moment uh teletext is
D :  Yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on T_V_ , like getting information . So uh , when you ask people , what do they use ,
A :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . That's ridiculous .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  That's a ne i it It's a new technology , but it's not incorporated right now .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , my personal preferences . Um ,
D :  I think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five .
D :  Mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . Uh second , I think you will get the most revenue from i from it . Um ,
D :  yeah , people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of T_V_ , more than uh people who are el uh elder . Um second point , we have to impro improve the most used functions , as I said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls .
D :  Third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire , uh people used to uh
D :  get lost off the remote controller , so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the T_V_ where you can put the the remote control in .
A :  Yeah , that's a cool idea .
D :  Um ,
D :  that's about it , I think . Yeah .
C :  When you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that what what are you think about ?
D :  Uh not not the r not the functions , but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control . So you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons , but if you don't use them , yeah it's
C :  Uh , the funtionability .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Ah okay , so focusing more on the used buttons .
D :  Yeah , they have to be on it j just to t to get it done if necessary , but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or
C :  Yeah .
C :  Could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example .
D :  Yeah , perhaps . Just for the minor functions perhaps .
C :  Thank you .
C :  Yeah , ma perhaps , just just an idea .
D :  Just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah ?
D :  'Kay , that's it .
A :  Thank you , Tim .
A :  Janus , can you uh
C :  Uh yeah yeah , I'll go , sure .
C :  Right uh , I'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . Well uh what I did was I dissected uh uh current remote controls and um I viewed how how they w looked , how they worked , uh what kind of components are involved , and how they are connected together . And uh after that I put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised and I'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . And I'll explain a bit about uh how it works and how we could uh build one and why I think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off .
C :  Um right . Uh well what I did was uh I I checked uh remote controls and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , not like all probably know . And the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a T_V_ or uh a stereo or something , and those uh have a transmitter that's also focused on infrared , so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with Bluetooth for instance then uh the T_V_ should have Bluetooth too in order to communicate , so that would mean extra cost for the user and thus uh that's that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us .
C :  So that's probably why most controls are still infrared . Furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , so that would probably uh mean lower costs and uh i that could mean for us a good thing uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote . Well uh as I mentioned ready , we have some Bluetooth Well it may be possible , but uh I figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget , but that's not for me to decide , but that's maybe something for marketing to look into . F because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh Bluetooth or or radio waves , although
D :  What do you think about uh incorporating Bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the T_V_ , connected to the T_V_ ?
C :  Yeah , actually I have t
D :  So it's in the wrong product .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , I actually I figured that would be that would be rather nice , but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function . So in in theory you'd actually just move the problem , but uh what I did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . If somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , I dunno , maybe uh maybe something to look into , I dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be . But it may be uh may be something to explore . Uh I'll I'll just explain a bit of the components . Uh first you have the energy source . The energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery uh that you can find anywhere . I figured that would be best , 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that . Uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch there is a switch uh between these . When the switch is pressed in a w on this this case it switches a button , when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , and in uh immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh displaying to the user that something has happened . That's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh . Or I press button but nothing's happening on the T_V_ , so is is something wrong or something .
C :  So that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user . Uh w well the signal goes via chip that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals and then it's processed and then it's sent to the infrared bulb where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . And those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . Uh well my personal preferences here , well we have to keep it simple . Not too many uh gadgets and functions , just like you said uh well the most users n uh you have a lot of buttons and you u u use you don't use them , so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those .
C :  Uh I I think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving . So uh no input from the television . So I think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that , because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , and so in order to receive the signals from uh what's on T_V_ and such . So I figure that would be uh spending too much money and time and
D :  Um ,
D :  yeah , maybe another problem uh ,
D :  I think current T_V_s can even send infrared .
C :  Yes , but what should we uh s I I I f I agree with you , but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ? 'Cause that would be I mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control . These all uh all stuff that we have to take in account . So I I my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all . Um , well we should uh look into the design and the functionability . Like I said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions , or well uh just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh stuff . And uh don't overbuild , we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions , but we we should stick to the basics . So that was my uh my personal opinion . And that was my uh my presentation uh
D :  Huh .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay , thank you Janus .
B :  Yes , I can go ahead . Last presentation . Okay .
A :  You do ? The last presentation . You have plenty of time , Tim and uh Janus don't uh talk to ten minutes , so uh take your time .
A :  If you take your time too long I will uh eventually uh
A :  warn you .
B :  Well , I'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions .
B :  Um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness , so tha that's that's some of the main points . And another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult , so use as as little functions as possible or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . If you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time , 'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see , but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure .
D :  Hmm .
B :  And uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen , but s I don't know in how far that is possible , since we are sticking to uh um infrared and and the remote cannot receive anything , but uh we might uh consider that . Um well , of course I I hope this is all clear to you . If you you can use remote like this with all the functions ,
D :  Hmm .
B :  many functions , but Well , your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . You have to be very careful what you push , and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour from uh um yeah well , where is it ? Where the hell he here I guess and , yeah , when you have to uh use something else . So just keep it simple , make clear buttons , easy to use . For example if you want to use a play and back and stop ,
B :  that's very important .
B :  Um well this was because of our last discussion , if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , but um it's no longer uh applying .
B :  Well yeah , I prefer to use it only for T_V_
B :  and um
B :  n uh not to give too many options and and if possible , uh the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select
A :  Uh you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one , so uh you you want to keep it simple , but I think that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one .
B :  Yeah , and so that's where the difficulties lie .
C :  Yeah , but
B :  Yeah , this so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other . Do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought , or do we want to use um many buttons . So um weighing those factors .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , but
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm it's maybe an option uh if you use an L_C_D_ or a touch screen um ,
D :  that in the middle are the the main keys , like displayed on the
D :  Uh yeah .
B :  The doesn't .
D :  .
D :  Yeah , this ? No ? Yeah . Something like that . Okay , just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh
D :  channel switching , and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but when all the questions I had Do we want to use uh a menu display on the T_V_ ? Or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ? 'Cause if you use a memory display on the T_V_ , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay . Uh so that's my recommendation , if you use many options in one buttle button , um display the menu on the T_V_ and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , is too complicated for most users .
D :  Mm .
D :  Nah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I think so too , but and that's partly because um uh a lot of T_V_s have different menus , and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on T_V_ .
C :  Yeah , but
B :  Yeah , that will be a problem .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well you d you have to keep in mind that uh several T_V_s uh don't even have a menu structure , or they have a very simple menu structure , so you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not our remote won't be able to work on all televisions . And that would be uh a considerable problem .
B :  Yes .
B :  So if we have to stick with current technologies and uh
B :  well yeah , the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this . Use big clear buttons . Not too many .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So maybe we'll loose a few option uh options , but I think i this is more important . Um
B :  especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen .
C :  Not embed
C :  Yeah , but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something .
B :  And yeah , if you want to uh uh s put on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . Not first change menu options or switch something . Um , well yeah , as you already told , give some feedback . If the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And um , well , my conclusion is uh is uh less is more , keep it simple . So uh maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible on t because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the the television , some you you'll never know uh and never use , and therefore it's uh important if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Uh , I think the idea uh about uh touch screen
D :  um is very good . Um ,
D :  because recently uh I saw news item on T_V_ um about
D :  uh new telephones uh for elder people . Um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up , um
D :  and that's a big ad advantage I think , because
D :  one the one hand uh
D :  you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something . It's uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  very visual intended .
D :  What was I to say more ?
B :  Maybe that's an option . Um keep the primary buttons visible . Uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form . But uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear and maybe use a touch screen , or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . Um
D :  Yeah okay , but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea
B :  Yeah .
D :  then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ?
C :  The extra functions .
B :  The extra functions , you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , and then all all the options will become available and you just c s yeah t scroll through them .
D :  Yeah , but l like menu functions or
C :  Yeah .
D :  Ah okay .
C :  Wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet and uh I'll just make um uh let's say fifteen buttons on it , and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with or sub-items , sub-functions .
D :  Yeah , I think so .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Well um then I'd like to make a proposal .
B :  If you make one big touch screen ,
C :  Yes .
B :  use the same concept as here , keep the buttons always available and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah , like like the iPod idea that that we just saw . You just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus , and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Uh uh I think that will be great .
B :  Okay .
A :  So you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen .
D :  Yeah , I think so .
C :  Yeah , I wou I would actually go for the
A :  Jirun ?
B :  Okay , I agree , but I think it's very important that they always um make the same buttons accessible , so use just for special options a part of the touch screen .
D :  Yeah , of course .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And so um an elder designer picks up th the of an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the T_V_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions .
A :  Yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I had another uh idea about maybe parental control . Um ,
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  like building in uh some kind of PIN code uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels , uh but children uh if children don't don't know the PIN code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah wh
B :  Is that possible to use or no ?
C :  That is possible , that well that actually depends on the television , but I think I figure that would be
D :  Th there's just
B :  Well , yeah well , does it have to depend on the television ?
D :  Ju just a simple log-in , something like that .
C :  Well , y you s you see the fi uh thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels , the the channels are different on each te television , they aren't set in a preset order , so uh if you uh lock on a remote , uh let's say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Well , I think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure that um remote control and the T_V_ match , and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh change the settings of the T_V_ , like colour and then volume and uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , th that kind of stuff , but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um , you address the the channels and like uh oh , that's channel fifteen , that's uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yes .
D :  vi violent channel , uh m my ki my kids uh I don't want my kids to watch that , then you set the priority to only parents ,
B :  Oh , something like that .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , that would b
A :  Okay , yeah .
B :  Well b but make it a separate option in the menu , so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh displayed here , so uh parents uh
D :  for example . But
C :  Yeah , that .
D :  Yeah okay , but but yeah , that's just
D :  that's an a an added feature .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . But let's not uh go too wide about the those things , that's that why we're here . It's it's a nice idea , but I think that's we wel later in the stage . I've one little question about um a total touch screen or uh um a p yeah , a partial , uh because I think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals uh and uh the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen , but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible .
D :  Yeah , th th those things are nice .
D :  Partial .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , but but if you display it on L_C_D_ screen with r r really big numbers
B :  Yeah , you can de display it on the on the old style . You can display actual buttons on the touch screens .
D :  that's just as e just as easy .
C :  Uh . I I do
A :  Yeah . Yeah , that's true , that's true .
C :  Uh I do agree , because well , it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen or when you touch a button , but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience . W we are aiming for younger people and they they chose
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Yeah , it's different .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's true , yeah . Yeah , yeah yeah , yeah , that's a good point . Yep .
D :  Yeah , age b below forty .
C :  So that's that's probably uh a
D :  And th those young people , yeah . Y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff , so
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  They like the fancy stuff , yeah . That's true .
D :  A touch screen , like Microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm
D :  I th I think we can do that too .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh are done .
D :  Done .
A :  Uh I've uh added the this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind . Um each time I uh I had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think . Uh so that can be uh can be read out . Uh a f a few things I uh I noticed uh were um
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Moment . Ooh .
A :  Uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is I think uh how uh it's going to look uh with uh we must keep it simple , but have the opportunity to uh have more options and have them uh hidden or something , so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons or uh um and uh the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television , so you must uh the the the the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television . I think that's the point what uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  we discussed .
B :  Yes .
D :  Yeah , yeah , some of them . The menus uh are not identical for all th for all T_V_s , so you have to display it on one uh T_V_ .
B :  Well you can use um when you uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the T_V_ , then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda T_V_ it is , from ah , it's a Philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable the capable from the t
D :  Yeah , but that's not possible .
D :  Mm-hmm , mm yeah .
A :  Yeah , but you have uh uh an yeah , but you have an international market range , so you have I think a big range of
D :  Add th that that's an opportunity .
B :  Well there are universal d um um remotes and they all have a functionality for all the T_V_s , uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  But they
D :  But
A :  And it's not too complex to do it .
C :  Well they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your T_V_ and that that is bit of a tricky job . I actually use one of those when They are they are kinda kinda troublesome , but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , because uh in order for the remote to process something from the T_V_ , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive , and that's well
D :  No .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Well
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . Oh um mo no , you can just say uh the c
D :  No no no .
D :  He he he he me he means just just one other thing . Uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press yeah , you have to press a code for T_V_ .
A :  Just build it in .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
B :  In codes , y you you get a b a book with codes . You look up , I have a Philips H_ fifty five and it says press code four five five and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote and it displays all your uh menu options .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Oh , okay , yeah , sure , uh
C :  Yeah yeah yeah .
C :  Oh , yeah yeah , sure , that would be possible , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Now we uh just connect uh the T_V_ type uh to a set of options , in just just in the memory , so that if you yeah , like profile , so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of T_V_ uh
B :  Memory in the in the remote .
A :  Yep .
C :  Profiles .
C :  Yeah .
D :  the memory uh
D :  pops up the options .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , that would be possible . Yeah , sure .
A :  Okay .
D :  I th don't think that's uh that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables .
C :  No , that wouldn't be uh
C :  Yeah , a few variables .
B :  Yeah , well um if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds T_V_s at maximum . If you have all of them , all the old and new T_V_s summed up , so uh I think uh it is possible .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Ah it is . It is definitely po
D :  But , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new T_V_ that isn't incorporated in the remote
A :  We have five minutes to go .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well then you have to buy a new one , it's very good for marketing
D :  New remote ?
B :  Maybe , or an update , software update .
D :  A firmware upgrade or something , but from where ?
B :  Firmware update , you say .
C :  Yeah , firmware upgrade .
D :  Ah .
D :  Maybe w
C :  That's maybe the cup holder . Yeah .
D :  No m may no , maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh U_S_B_ or a firewire connection , so that you can uh connect it to the P_C_ and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well , not everybody has uh has uh a P_C_ at home . Well the most most people have , but not not everybody and
B :  Well , at uh you can go back to the shop and uh they
D :  Yeah , like a s kind of service centre .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , ser o and they can download it for you .
C :  Yeah , maybe something like service cen Or you could well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . Well already digital information is sent t to the the standards , T_V_ uh connections , you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels , so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard T_V_ uh
C :  Yeah .
C :  Well then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in , we could actually look at into it , but I dunno , it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it and
B :  Receiving . Oh yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Difficult .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I I think it's uh
D :  most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop .
C :  Yeah , that would be probably best , yeah .
B :  Yeah yeah , uh s I think some I think it's good idea , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Like when you when you buy a T_V_ you just ask well I'll
D :  It's it's it's not a lot of work , just one uh docking station where you put it in , press start , bling bling , updated .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that would be best , yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . You don't buy a T_V_ every week , new teev so .
B :  Okay , let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh
C :  No no . Exactly , so
B :  Um m for which one are we going ? My mistake .
D :  Let's vote .
B :  That one or uh
C :  Yeah , my vote goes out to the right .
B :  Your vote and your Okay .
D :  My vote too .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And your vote ?
B :  Well , I was uh doubting about which one to take , but uh you've convinced me that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And also like a clapping uh
D :  li like device that uh pops open .
B :  Opens up is too difficult or uh
C :  Flips open .
D :  Uh too difficult , um maybe uh it's easier to break it .
A :  N yeah .
B :  Break it , I don't get
D :  Yeah , th th th that i uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  It's very sensitive .
B :  Oh so Yeah .
D :  Like my telephone , it's uh it's sensitive too .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay well uh it's almost at the end . So we have now a lunch break , finally , yeah . Uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work , once again uh thirty minutes . Uh I will put my minutes uh I have updated them so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too .
D :  Ah .
D :  Thirty minutes ?
A :  Thirty minutes , the
D :  How minutes ?
A :  Failure . Uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email . I don't think I can uh say much about it , so uh uh wait for your email and uh hopefully you get it done uh in the in the thirty minutes , and I w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes . Yeah ?
D :  One question , uh how late do we have to get back be back here ?
A :  Uh well uh thirty minutes .
B :  A quarter to one maybe ?
A :  Uh , yeah .
D :  Thirty minutes lunch break ?
A :  Thirty minutes lunch break , yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Oh .
D :  I thought forty five . Yeah .
A :  Forty five ? Uh then would it be uh one o'clock . Or we we ask our personal coach . Okay . Thank you . Thank you , uh that was a very uh good session I think , we uh we
D :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , is it possible to store this on the share documents or what
D :  Yeah , me too .
A :  Uh ye well
D :  Save as .
A :  Yeah , because uh all uh things are uh stored in smart board dot uh X_D_K_ and that's in
D :  Yeah , v
D :  But but you can open a from your pr from your laptop . Yeah , maybe . Save as .
B :  'Kay , save it as an image on the res
C :  Export . Maybe not export function .
A :  No .
D :  No .
D :  Export .
A :  Well I can I can uh
D :  Export H_T_M_L_ .
B :  No , and use an image if possible .
D :  Huh , image ?
B :  J_ PEG .
C :  G_ yeah , J_ PEG .
B :  J_ PEG . Yeah , it's better
D :  Paper size A_ four . Uh screen size . In this directory .
B :  Yeah .
C :  N oh .
B :  Oh yeah , it's not connected to the
A :  You all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work .
B :  to our P_C_s .
D :  No ?
D :  Yeah , it is connected .
B :  It's connected ?
D :  Yeah , I think so .
C :  To room .
A :  Deskt Huh . No .
C :  I'll just uh saved in my documents .
D :  Oh .
C :  Yeah in my own uh in my own messenger .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Project documents , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It gives the na Oh .
B :  Yes .
C :  Okay , nice .
A :  Okay , thank you .
B :  The questionnaire , fill in uh we fill out d after lunch or uh
A :  Uh well , it's it's simply filling oh no , it's uh it's also filling out no , I'd do it after lunch I think . I'm hungry , so do it after lunch . Thank you all .
B :  Okay .
C :  Aye , cheers .
B :  Yes .
D :  Thank you .
A :  You're welcome .
B :  We can leave the P_C_ on I think , yeah and return to the
D :  Yeah , of course .
A :  Yeah . Well I bring it to my uh personal room .
B :  Yeah , bring to I gotta bring it home .
D :  To my exave executive
A :  My executive uh big room with the with the panting .
B :  A big office .
B :  Yes .
D :  Aye .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A : 
B :  Here we go again .
C :  My mouse is not working anymore . He's uh when I put it in , is is going to beep beep beep .
B :  Oh .
D :  Oh .
B :  Okay .
D :  Oh , I got a nice little screen here over here .
D :  I got like this big black border uh on every side .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm , okay .
D :  I'll I'll fix it . Yeah , whatever .
A :  Everybody ready ?
B :  Yeah , it's okay .
A :  Welcome at the functional design meeting , again presented by Maarten .
A :  Uh this is the agenda , the opening . Uh , we've got three presentations . And I'm gonna show you some of the new projects requirements that were sent to me . And we're gonna make a decision on the remote control functions . We have uh forty minutes .
D :  Yes .
A :  Oh , well this is the the closing already . So uh well we start off with the th the first presentation then .
A :  Uh , I think um in uh we have to do it in uh in right order . Maybe the
B :  Okay .
D :  I don't know what the right order is . So
B :  No .
A :  Well , it
C :  Huh .
A :  Oh that . It won't doesn't Maybe we should start with the the technical functions .
C :  Okay , how can I get this on the whiteboard ?
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Well it's you dumped the file in the uh in the sh in the project document folder . You've already done that ?
B :  In project .
C :  Okay , I've done that .
B :  No can that open .
C :  Yes .
A :  Well let's close this one . We'll just uh open a new one .
B :  Open it there .
A :  Uh , well . Yes .
A :  Uh-oh . New thing .
A :  Oh yeah , uh I have to say something . Uh , due to some uh technical problems I haven't uh digitized the last uh the meeting minutes . But I'll uh make sure that uh happens next time .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
B :  About the get
A :  And I'll get this one uh in digital uh form too .
C :  'Kay , we're going to um
C :  uh talk about working design . Um , the method of the remote control is uh electrical energy , it activates a chip uh in the remote . It's an electrical circuit
C :  which compose uh messages in the form of uh uh infrared signals to control the television .
C :  Mm , it's a nowadays very uh known , a known uh uh technology .
C :  Um , the known technology can make a cost very low . Uh , it's a wild uh a wide sale uh of uh remote controls in the world . And and the components are very uh very cheap . Um ,
C :  Uh , diodes , uh bat batteries and uh uh LED lights , they're needed and they're uh everywhere available . Uh , again , it's a fair price . It's a common uh technology uh , like I told um Uh , the circuit board , it's the most um important uh
C :  um part of the remote control . Uh , we can use for that uh fibreglass with copper wires , it's it is uh
C :  can be made as fast as printing paper . It's uh it's all very uh
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , they're making it uh all the time . Uh ,
A :  Okay .
C :  and it's not uh very specialised uh technology .
C :  I haven't come to here , but
C :  um I've got uh some uh images of uh remote controls . They were not uh very uh trendy or just uh
C :  just a remote control like everyone knows . So I don't know uh why I should put it here .
C :  Uh
A :  Okay . But it's the technical side of the remote control .
C :  Yes , but uh I uh haven't made it because uh of the time . But
A :  Oh .
A :  Okay . Well , we'll we'll have to skip that part then .
C :  What ?
B :  Okay .
A :  But you don't think it's a problem um to design uh the technical part of the remote control ? It's gonna be easy ?
C :  No .
C :  Yes .
A :  Okay .
B :  But nothing restricted for user interface ?
A :  Yeah . M
B :  With technical
C :  Um , no , it's uh it's just a part of uh a known technology , yeah .
B :  I don't know .
A :  Okay .
B :  'Kay .
C :  Remote control is nothing special nowadays .
A :  R regardless of what type of functions we want to implement . Doesn't really matter .
B :  Okay .
C :  Um
B :  But I kind of uh
C :  I don't think so , because of the all the televisions uh there are a few maybe a couple of televisions with the new functions , but is it useful to put them on a on a standard uh remote ?
A :  Okay . Yeah , okay .
B :  Yes .
B :  Uh
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , we'll see . We'll see later on .
B :  Well , the technical functions . Um , well I don't know if you got the same uh pictures as I got , but uh I got these two , and I think they're we have to focus uh on uh the uh one hand the expert view or the novice user .
A :  No .
C :  No .
B :  th I think it's it's very much uh depending on the user requirements , I don't s uh know who's doing t
A :  Well , uh will there be some uh user requirements later on ? The ones I I've uh received from the account manager . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but it I think that's very important to watch uh what kind of functions there we want to uh put in a remote control .
A :  Well , we'll keep this in mind , and then discuss it later on .
B :  Yeah , well y we can put functions in it when uh yeah , when we uh get the user requirements uh and we can update it .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay , but this real this uh big d uh distinction between this type of remote . we should we should choose one uh we should not compromise but uh really choose for uh expert viewer or novice v Yeah ? Well , what that's what you want trying to say .
D :  Yes , I agree . Yeah .
B :  Well , yeah w if you want try a a a huge market , if you want to reach a huge market , uh like elderly people and we have to choose for novice user . But I don't know . It's it's really um depending on how how how far the the the remote controls are already in n um in use .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , well some of these Uh , yeah .
A :  Well , some of that will Yeah , but i but it will be more clear when we come to the uh u uh some of the new requirements .
B :  Yeah , probably , yeah .
D :  Yes .
A :  So
B :  Uh well , there are l at least uh basic functions , uh like just th the channels uh one till nine , uh on and off switch , which must be clear with a red button or something like that . Um , most standard uh have volume , of course , and a mute function , and , of course , the next and previous channel . I think that's just basic what we need . And from that on we can user requirements what we need more .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Uh
B :  Yeah , I just um um I thought Joost was looking at the trendy the trends in the markets , and I don't know if there uh are any um uh if you put more functions , more buttons , maybe it's com becoming less trendy or something like that .
D :  Yes .
D :  I haven't really found a conclusion like that .
B :  M you can just you can k you can keep it in mind that . I don't know . Uh , I th I thought the the with less buttons you can make a more trendier uh yeah , more trendier design , I think . I think .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Design .
D :  Sounds interesting .
B :  Yeah ?
B :  Uh , well , that's all I have to say , I think .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , that was it .
D :  Alright .
A :  Well , then the Marketing expert can uh tell us something about the current market .
D :  Yes .
B :  .
D :  Yeah . It's alright . Um
D :  Alright , I've done some research for functional requirements . Um yes .
D :  The working method um there were hundred uh uh w h one hundred people , uh
D :  how do you say uh , f watched using remote controls in the usability lab and they also uh filled out a questionnaire uh with a few questions . Uh , I've lined them up here . Uh , ask whether um common remote control looks good or not , about willingness to spend money on remote control , about zapping behaviour , and uh and stuff like that . I uh have found some interesting things . We do we do got a market . Um , three out of four people claim m uh to find remote controls ugly . So if we make a trendy design , we sure have seventy fi seventy five percent of the market , which you can reach .
D :  Um , three out of four users uh zaps a lot , as I uh quoted here from the uh results . Zap buttons are used one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . That's quite a lot . Um ,
D :  relevant options are , of course , power buttons . Although , only used once per hour . Uh , channel selection , volume and buttons for text , and the more um , yeah , other functions , like audio settings , video settings , sound settings are not said to be very important and uh very much used . Furthermore , fifty percent says
D :  uh they only use ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . That doesn't say we got we can leave ninety percent off . But
D :  it sure um says we shouldn't make it too uh complicated . Fifty percent also claims uh to have lost a remote control very often in the room . And um an important thing here , the most important customers uh , which is over seventy percent of our market , is in the age range of thirty six to sixty five years old . And uh elderly people , our market , are less interested in uh nice features , but more willingly to spend more money on remote controls .
D :  So , what I was thinking oh , wrong side . We shouldn't implement too much features on uh on our remote control , because elderly people will get th lost . Group features for a higher usability , uh what I was claiming in the previous meeting . Um , all the settings , about audio settings , video settings and channel settings , which are not very often used ,
D :  we could group them uh on one button
D :  and make them accessible uh in one menu button or whatever , because they are used very rarely and well , it uh there are a lot of options there , so we can really make uh yeah , how do you say ,
D :  we can spare at buttons over there . And um , if you want to implement V_C_R_ and D_V_D_ options , group them in the button , not too uh
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Small buttons , so they won't be very um , how do you say
A :  Visually presents .
D :  Yes , won't be very present , thank you . And a trendy look , well uh , although seventy percent of the market is uh consists of elderly people uh who don't really care for trendy looks or whatever , I guess it can do no harm to make it trendy for the other thirty percent .
D :  That was kind of what I found .
A :  Okay . Well , then we I'm gonna show you some of the new project requirements and then we gonna discuss on uh what features we find important . Uh , well some of the uh new requirements make some of your findings quite uh irrelevant , I think .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yes .
A :  Because um
A :  uh s decided to put They have decide to put two additional requirements forward .
A :  Well , now I see four . That's kinda strange .
D :  Two ?
A :  Well , they say tele teletext becomes outdated since the popularity of the internet . Well , I think that may be so , but well , we can't just leave the teletext button off . It's impossible , I think . So the compromise we could make is just to make one teletext button , you know , like on and off , and don't make a lot of special put a lot of special features on it to make it transparent or You know , it's just you want you want to be able to make use of teletext , but not to play with it that much . So we have to think of that . The remote control should only be used for television . Otherwise , the project becomes more complex , which endangers the time t t ma uh the time to market . So maybe we should leave all D_V_D_ and V_C_R_ related features off completely .
B :  Well
D :  No uh , I agree , I agree .
B :  No way .
D :  Not too much , no .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  I don't know . I think that uh
A :  that's what they're trying to say . Uh , our current customers are within the age group of forty plus . New products should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty . So you uh talked about the elderly who were willing to spend more on a remote control and who were interested . But , well , they're not relevant because we are aiming at a younger
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I don't really agree actually , to be honest . It's a very small market which we will approach then if we uh want to reach customers younger than forty . It's only like thirty percent of the total market . Mayb yeah ?
A :  Yeah , but it is it's is a dif it's a fact that the th th that bigger market you're talking about , we already cover that . Our company already sells remote control to the older people , but we we also want , you know , a new customer group . That's the one we haven't covered yet . So I think that's
A :  what the problem is . We haven't got remote controls for uh Well I think , yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Maybe maybe we can compromise a little bit . Not too much then , bu alright .
A :  Yeah , I think so . Maybe if it's no no , but I think we have to just keep in mind what the older age group wants . So maybe we can
A :  make a remote control that's primarily interesting for the younger group , but isn't that bad for an older person either . Uh , our corporate image sh should stay recognisable in our products . Our product's corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . Okay , something else nice to know .
D :  Yes .
B :  But what's our slogan ?
A :  Sorry ? Yeah , you will have to look that up .
B :  The slogan uh
D :  Yeah , I'll have a look .
D :  We put the fashion in electronics .
A :  I think it's something about the Oh , okay . I thought it w might be , let's make things better or something , but
B :  Puts fashion in electronics .
B :  Sense simplicity .
D :  Sense and simplicity .
A :  Okay well , let's go back to the
A :  the agenda .
A :  So we've now had to the three presentations . We know about the new project requirements .
A :  That means we can uh well d yeah , discuss on the remote control functions . Well , if I can uh make a start , I think it's becoming more clear what kind of remote control it's gonna be , and I already talked about the maybe you have a f familiar with the rem remote control that has the the can opener underneath it . I think we're we're looking for some Yeah , we we're looking for a really simple remote control with only basic T_V_ functions . Y well , that
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well , to be honest , if um our uh aim group is uh till forty , not older than forty , maybe that's not very uh yeah , we don't really need to have a simple remote control . I think we can implement more functions then , because um basically uh the younger people are more able to adapt to new technology and therefore will be a more
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but wha
A :  Yeah , yeah . M yeah , that's why um well a lot of um the use the requirements the the account manager sent me , I think they are are c are contradicting each other , because they want a simpler design , and no uh other uh s functions than just T_V_ , but they s do aim at a younger Well , ma
B :  But
D :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , but you sai you said that that a lot of functions aren't used . So why should j we put this function in ? I think more I think uh people younger people are more looking for just a trendy look than uh more functions .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well , I think
A :  But I think uh you we can make some discuss uh distinctions in uh what kin in the , know , th th in functions you have
A :  Well you have different kind of uh equipment in your room , like a t T_V_ and a D_V_D_ player . You can uh , know , you you can make very d you can put very detailed functions regarding the T_V_ set on your remote control uh with the with uh the , you know , audio settings and uh v uh screen settings . We don't want that . I think that was that became clear . We don't want . But w maybe we should put some func uh , I know that the younger people will most likely have a D_V_D_ player they want to ,
D :  Yes .
A :  you know , they want to uh
D :  Yeah , control .
B :  Yeah , but uh you said Yeah , d yeah , but th the functions are not in the remote control we're making .
A :  control , remotely .
A :  No , yeah , th th the user requirements of the the The new project requirements told us not to But maybe w Yeah . I think we maybe should
B :  It's n
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , well we should uh put some functions for other maybe for other equipment on it . But just the basic functions . Maybe like rewind and wind , or n what d what do you guys think ?
C :  But you can put them under the same button .
D :  Not much more than that .
A :  Yeah , if as far as possible .
D :  Yep .
D :  Or we can u u we could put 'em behind the flip-flap or whatever .
D :  So t
A :  But what do you think ? Do th should we implement features that uh uh or functions that to control other devices ? No , you don't think so ? Yeah , the new requirements say so .
B :  No .
B :  No , new requirements say no .
B :  So
C :  But you can put a play and stop and and rewind .
A :  Well , maybe it's maybe there there there is something th m most of the time these functions don't support the particular device as well as their their own remote control . You know , a lot of D_V_D_ players have some tricky settings with
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but
C :  Yes , but we
D :  Y yes .
B :  I i if it's too simple uh th they won't use the remote control , they use their own th th with lot more functions .
A :  Yep , exactly .
A :  That's that's wha
D :  But but for for example , V_C_R_ , that's better example in this case . I think on a remote control for television you don't need to be able to programme uh the V_C_R_ to start recording at three P_M_ or whatever , just play , stop , rewind and uh fast forward .
A :  No no , you don't No no , you don't need it . No , no .
B :  No , no . Exactly .
C :  Huh .
A :  Okay , but we have to think uh w we have to think D_V_D_ I th uh , I guess , so um but uh from my experience it's kinda a lot of D_V_D_ players , you know , like forwarding , goes differently . Uh , you get two speed or eight speed or sixteen speed . It's c sometimes a bit difficult . Maybe if we just leave the D_V_D_ functional m uh Well , I was thinking about putting it in , but concerning the project requirements and what you just said , I think we m should focus on the T_V_ then .
D :  Yeah , I know , but uh
B :  Mm , yeah .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , but just
B :  keep it simple and look more at th
A :  And uh and it's just an uh a complimentary remote and not a universal one . If you want to keep it simple , you can make a universal remote . Okay . It's just a s it it should be something that is like a gadget on your coffee table , and it's just for when you you you jump on the couch , you pick up the the the nice remote , the simple one , just to put on the television , nothing more .
B :  No .
B :  It's only for television . So
C :  Yes , but there are there are
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , nothing more . Exactly .
A :  Okay .
D :  Alright .
A :  Um , but what televis
C :  But how wi how will you be able to handle a whole market ? There are uh a dozen of uh dozens of of remote controls that have
A :  Yeah , we we'll make w this one trendy . And simple . Well , we we will come to that , but ju first on the on the functions . So we should put uh zap buttons on it . Um , also numbers , to uh to go to the specific channels .
B :  Yeah . The user interface is easy .
B :  And the basic yeah , basic functions , yeah .
D :  Yes , definitely , yeah .
A :  Uh ,
B :  It's too much integrated in the other .
A :  Okay , a t a teletext button should be there . But just one big teletext button , on and off .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Probably .
D :  Yeah , and maybe two or three other options , but not nothing more than that . I think stop function is very useful . If you have a uh a page which consists of more pages , and you are not a very quick reader ,
A :  Oh , okay .
D :  then I think it's very irritating if the next page shows up , but
A :  Yeah , but uh I think that becomes too difficult , it's not a very common function and people will have to read up on their remote then .
D :  Well , I use it very regularly , the action . I re I use it quite often .
A :  Yeah , yeah , but maybe you s yeah yeah , maybe y you do , but I've never heard of it in the first place . And
B :  Will you look
A :  we have to well t yeah , and t and teletext is becoming outdated . We just want to see what programmes are on and what time it is probably . Yeah . I don't know . I think that that's kin getting too complex for our remote . I don't know what you th guys think .
B :  Look at the market .
B :  Well
D :  Might be . Might be .
B :  Yeah , I uh , it's Sunday I always use it for the uh yeah , for the soccer uh
A :  Yeah , but do you like to have a such a s stop button ? Or do you think it uh
A :  I think it's a kind of uh uh very rare and special function .
B :  Well , uh when you uh uh when you look uh for example um , a couple of weeks ago I looked at the for the flights , and there are a lot of flights in one page , so if if th
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , it goes Yeah , but that's kind of stuff we should do on the internet right now . That's why it was uh said in the in the use in the r new requirements .
C :  Yes , but you could put
B :  Yeah , but
C :  on the z on the zap buttons you can put it to uh to uh access all the same pages . If you have seven pages , you can go up and down .
A :  Well yeah uh , lots of new televisions can store pages , you know , and then you can just skip manually through them using I think we should just put one teletext button on it . Then we meet uh the new requirements .
C :  Yes .
B :  True .
A :  we also meet the other thin y you sh you just re we have to choose for the the simple design , I guess .
B :  A simple yeah .
A :  Okay . Um , well , what functions do we have to decide on ?
A :  Or do we uh I dunno if we have t stif specifically name all the functions we n we want .
A :  We have the zap and uh the volume . Should we do m make them very big ? The the the zap button . D d
D :  I think the plus and the minus button should be uh quite present , yep .
C :  Yes .
A :  Th that's that's that's considered to be trendy also .
B :  But trendy , yeah . I don't know .
A :  Or maybe you should place them on a uh , in a special way ?
C :  Maybe we can make uh a kind of a joystick .
A :  Yeah , something or uh somethin special way to to zap through the it has to s it has to be yeah , and quick . You have to use it very quickly .
B :  Original . It was uh
D :  Yep .
D :  If you grab the remote , your hands should be on top of the plus .
B :  True .
A :  Yeah , and it the buttons should make it um possible to to zap through your channels in a rapid at a rapid pace .
D :  Yes .
A :  Oh , what should we decide on then ?
C :  But
A :  I think in a in a case of this simple remote control , the technical aspects which uh weren't worked out already , but it w shouldn't be a problem then .
B :  Yeah .
C :  No , it's o just signals uh and the television d uh does the rest .
A :  Yep .
B :  Maybe uh
A :  No , okay , but we don't have to uh , when we don't want to uh control other devices , I think it makes it even more simple .
C :  No .
B :  Uh maybe we uh uh the batteries maybe . If you use large batteries or small batter batteries .
C :  The most standard batteries .
A :  I think
A :  I think that we should use uh d yeah , not not uh the b the watch kind th the most uh Well , it has to be simple , and I wi
D :  I think double A_ .
B :  Yeah ?
D :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The most ordinary uh batteries .
A :  Which are most likely to be found somewhere in the house , you know .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yep .
A :  Oh . How much time do we ha we have left uh ? M m m more than thirty minutes ? Uh ten twenty minutes . Well , uh these these shouldn't
D :  I think about twenty minutes .
C :  But i in a way we have to be uh uh special .
B :  Early break .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , okay . But that's that's
A :  Do you uh have you have you think about tha thought about that ? How we can what the extra touch can be . Do you suggest design or the shape or some gadget f f kind of feature or Well , it was something about how we lose them . Maybe it should be a remote control when you you clap you hands it makes some noise or some gadget kind of thing .
C :  Maybe th m
D :  I think that's n that's more for a for an age range or uh ten to twelve or whatever .
B :  To find him . That's maybe yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I don't know . I don't know . Nah , um a lot of people like to have such kind kind of kind of gay kind of things . It w it w should be like a birthday present or something that you give someone , and it is i has something nice . Or maybe it w should have a big uh light that can flash or something on it , or maybe it should or an or the like the the can opener . Maybe it contains some feature that you don't normally link to a remote control . I think it's very impor because we're gonna make such a basic remote control , we have to do something to make it special . It's gonna cost twenty five Euros .
D :  Yeah , yeah , that's good one , yep .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Ye I think the can opener i is a brilliant idea actually , because television and beer is not a rare combination .
A :  Yeah , but the well , it's already been done .
B :  Yeah , but that's yeah .
A :  Nah . Yeah , that's true . But and I think it's gonna be uh very uh it has to be sturdy or something , so maybe with with bouncing pads so that you can just throw it on the floor or something . it has to be used something special , and you really it has to , you know y not s people , when they buy it , they have to think , well this one lasts for a long time . We're really gonna use them . Not some thing you you throw away next week , you know .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yep .
D :  No , that's true .
A :  So maybe uh that's i I think that's when uh when we decide on these type of functions , know , basic functions , uh it's very important to find something like this . So there's a very important task for you . And maybe we can all think about it . Uh , also for you maybe , when t you it's very nice when you can be entra when you can be trendy , and and uh and al as in a friend use friendly as well , you know . So big buttons , flashy design , and maybe some kind of gadget kind of thing .
B :  Be original , yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . And use friendly , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Must brain-storm .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah , a swapable front or whatever .
A :  Yeah , or just different colours would be uh I don't know if people also wanna spend more money on fronts for their uh remote control . It could be be Yeah , you never know , but
B :  Well
C :  For the remote control .
B :  Why not ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  More money for us .
A :  But it and I think we have to make it quite big .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Quite big . Yeah , you think ?
D :  Yes , definitely , definitely .
A :  Yeah , people
C :  That's to be uh a formed for your hand .
A :  So , and and also because uh it is expensive . If you want it to be something , you know , it's ha doesn't have much functions want to be you don't want to get it l make it
D :  Yes , it it it should be f be visible nearly anywhere in the room . As I uh as I said during my presentation , fifty percent uh o
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And shou and should ni look nice when you put it on a table . I I think you m might wanna put it uh yeah , that it it it it stands up . Yeah , you have to put it on its So it's like a vase or uh something you put on a table . no no , put stuff inside it . But , it's like like a statue or something
B :  A standard or something .
D :  Yeah .
D :  A face ? Or uh yeah , yeah . Yeah .
C :  More like a joystick then .
D :  Yeah , yeah , I see what you mean , yep .
B :  It's like you have uh four phones . Something like that .
A :  Yeah yeah , but yeah , but you also can put it somewhere near the window in
D :  If you do that , but I don't know if that's possible within the production cost of twelve and a half Euros . I in in the base we could like make uh a button , and if you push it , the remote control itself s makes noise . That's probably stupid , but uh as I found here uh , fifty percent , was it fifty ? Uh fifty percent
A :  That it's it's fashionable .
A :  I I don't
A :  Oh , yeah .
C :  But that's that's fun for the first time , and then the second
D :  fifty percent often loses remote control .
A :  Yeah , but but when you when it gets lost , how can you press the button to make it
D :  No uh , of the base the the the the the the the thing you put it in .
A :  Oh , okay .
B :  On the television .
B :  Oh , like this .
A :  Uh , that's kind of nice .
D :  If an a button in in that uh
C :  Or you can
A :  And then also you don't even need batteries , because you can make it uh chargeable .
B :  A char chargeable . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , you can ma make rechargeable one , yeah . Why not .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that w yeah , but yeah , the pro No , well I think that it might be t p Well , nee but we don't Yeah . Maybe you , but we don't know much about production cost , but when you you can imagine that when you spend twenty five Euros on a remote control and it's a basic remote control , then the then the money there must be money to spend on that kind of st you know , rechargeable units .
B :  Why not .
C :  With recharger .
D :  It should only cost twelve and a half Euros , of course . Aye ?
A :  Yeah , but we would d ma we'd do it in Taiwan and So , it's not gonna be that expen
B :  Production .
D :  Yeah , okay .
B :  It should be possible . I think it's a good idea .
A :  Uh I I think it's a great idea .
D :  Yeah .
A :  S some kind of be I've never seen that before , and you make it uh um be uh , you see it with uh the mo the mouses nowadays .
B :  To make a base or something ?
D :  Yes . Yes , definitely . Yeah .
C :  Yes , but is that handy ?
A :  Well , I well it's really ch you can recharge it , so you ha never have the battery problem . That's one . And uh you can always find your remote control up
B :  It's it's it's it's
C :  But but remote controls remote controls nowadays can can last uh two years , three years , with with t two batteries .
B :  it's not the purpose to be handy , it's
A :  Uh , okay . Well , maybe yeah , you could when that's when it's too costly , you could probably skip the recharger , but you will you do need uh also an uh , also you would need a battery in the the base unit as well , you know . Does it makes it kinda
C :  And then you
C :  Yes . Or
D :  Well y you you could connect that to two hundred to twenty volts , of course . I don't know .
B :  Mm . Yeah , but that's not it's ugly , I think .
A :  Yeah , yeah . Okay . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but then it's very easy to make it also a rechargeab I don't think that is gonna cost much to make it also a recharge function in it .
B :  No .
D :  On the other hand , if you don't do it , we can also make a nice bay . I mean , it looks trendy and still still put a bleep function in it , but um I think the bay is definitely uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think it's a good idea . And make it , you know , we we um
A :  Well , we uh it's it isn't a t a most uh costly uh remote control . We can save on the on the functions . We just put some simple button in , make it big and sturdy , nothing more , and just make s sure there's some noise that it can make , or probably some kind of cheap light thing around it or that it uh that it lights up , it's also nice . And if you put it away , I think it's uh w we have to we uh that's uh it's not a easy market . We have to something special . And for twenty five Euros people want something remote c special from your mote control , and we can't deliver that in r with uh regards to the functions , because we aren't gonna put
D :  Sure , why not . Yep .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  True .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Definitely .
D :  With eye candy , ear candy , whatever . Yeah , definitely .
A :  Yeah . And then uh when make it , you know , nice looking shape and this and then you also you got the stand-up thing .
A :  Yeah . I think I think it's a good idea .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , it must be must be a gadget to have .
A :  Yeah . Oh , if it let's well , we will see what's possible concerning the the costs , and if it's possible we'll do that . And we even try to save up on other stuff to make sure we can do such a thing . And the first thing we the most likeable thing to to n to skip is then probably the recharge function or something . If that's too expensive , we won't do that . But it would be nice .
D :  Definitely , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , we c
D :  It would be nice , yes .
A :  It's the idea . I know that batteries last long nowadays . And and what people just think about , well , I'll never have to buy any r batteries again , so y b because it's very annoying when your battery is empty . And you know then when you haven't batteries around , and probably for two weeks , your remo I've experienced that that
D :  Most televisions break down before the battery pack is empty , so yes .
A :  Yeah , okay .
A :  So , easy functions . Well , we will we will I think we'll work that out , zapping , numbers on it , bi
B :  Or just give a beep when the battery's out or uh down .
D :  Yeah , why not .
A :  Yeah . But it's also annoying . 'cause as long as it stays as it ke keeps working , you're not very motivated to do something about it . Then it beeps all the time and . You don't want to have ever have those problems , and you won't have if if you have the rechargeable . And you don't have to use the unit , you can also put it on the side if people don't like it . Uh , i i in the in the ma Yeah , but it w I mean , if if they pay for it because they think , oh , that's a great idea , I'm gonna use it . And when it , you know , when time goes by and they think , well , I'll never put him in the recharger , I think last long enough , then they put it on side and they can use it now and then . Then when they look get m I I I know for sure that everybody who buys this remote control , within a couple of months of they will be in the situation that they they're seeking for the remote control , they wanna see something quick and uh just push the button and th uh , I think it's brilliant . Yeah , I've never it's so simple , but I've never seen it .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  true .
D :  No , that's true .
D :  Why not .
C :  But you pay for it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Bleep bleep bleep , oh there it is , yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  No . Nearly .
B :  And you can leave it just there .
A :  M maybe we should really do this . Okay now , well , how much time have we got left ? These clocks aren't uh synched . Oh , now I've put uh well , it is twenty p Okay , so we have ten minutes or something ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , I'll
D :  Something like that , yeah .
A :  Yeah , but we're uh we're done . I think .
B :  Uh fifteen minutes .
A :  We've decided on the functions . Well , there is some oh .
A :  There is a closing sheet .
A :  We have lunch break , and then we have thirty minutes of individual work .
D :  Oh .
A :  Oh okay , I'll make sure I'll I had some problems with uh the digitising the the first minutes , the the s the next minutes won't be a problem , but I'll try to make sure the first one will be in the folder too , but maybe it won't work , but you'll see . I think these are more important than the first ones , so
D :  We'll see .
B :  Can you make an uh uh
B :  a part of f folder for the minutes maybe ? That not not everything in one one uh folder .
A :  .
D :  Maarten , five minutes .
A :  Oh , five minutes . Yeah , because uh I I d I did uh the first minutes I did were were were a bit scratchy , you know . Then I did a s second one with a nicer layout , which I could uh , know , use for the other ones well , but uh I d think uh I forgot to do put done under the first one , and when you go write a second uh it's get it's not working when you try to write second uh paper or something . And then you you had to overwrite it or someth I don't know . Becau I d uh , it was not my uh pen .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Maybe .
D :  No , that's true uh , yeah .
D :  Should we by the way draw um
A :  this kind of looks you like .
D :  on our nice whiteboard , um a little uh idea of yeah .
A :  Of the shape .
B :  Or the sh
A :  Yeah , probably , it would be nice .
D :  I dunno . Has anyone got um a little bit detailed ideas about the shape ? I don't , for one .
B :  Do you get an idea of the shape ?
C :  Maybe like this pen .
D :  A bit bigger I guess , but
A :  No , bigger .
B :  A little bit bigger , yeah but
D :  The shape is nice , it's um
D :  something different , and we want we want that . Yeah .
C :  It has to feel nice in your hand .
A :  Well , I I I have to say , I have this uh can opening remote control in my head most of all , or I think some maybe we should no , that will be too costly . We shou we could also , that was a would also be an idea , but I don't think it I don't know if it exists already , you should like make Alessi or something design it .
B :  Oh , uh look uh look at the pictures .
D :  Okay , yeah .
A :  That would also be nice .
A :  But that's gonna then you c then you don't
D :  Yeah , but twelve and a half Euros ? Uh
A :  Yeah , but then you don't have t yeah it that's not something i that's in the production cost a one it's a one time , you know s was it's a single cost . Yeah , m but but then you can nah , I don't thin I think that it would be more expensive , because I've bought the Alessi stuff more often and even small pencil holders or something are more expensive .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  Would be a nice idea though .
A :  I don't know . I think it uh has to be a r it has to have round forms or something .
A :  Like something like that or so or so
D :  Something like that is very ergonomic .
A :  And on th and then uh s a base unit underneath it . It's also round .
D :  So
A :  Put it in there uh wire on it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe uh , I don't know , some some lights , a big but well .
B :  Yeah , flash lights at the side . At the side , or something like that .
A :  Volume and programme , yeah .
D :  Yes , volume and programme should be there I guess , because you hands wi uh y your hands will be in the smaller part .
A :  And some of the extra funct
A :  Some of the extra functions over here . Numbers .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , and the numbers on top , I guess .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And and lights ? How we're g well , maybe uh s a ring of no , no , you have to Maybe on the side of it .
D :  Maybe ro roun rounds uh uh l sorry .
B :  Yeah , side of it . Just two LEDs or something on the side . Yeah .
A :  Along the side uh strip of yeah .
D :  Maybe lights also around the volume and the p the plus minus programme buttons .
A :  Yeah , but I also meant the the blinking li w you know , the ones that also blink when you try to uh uh locate your remote .
D :  Oh .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , theys have to be
B :  Well , uh probably at the side .
B :  You know look at the front , but
A :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah . Exactly . When you you see it from the side , then it would look just like that .
B :  Yeah , exactly , and then there is yeah .
A :  And then you have
A :  a strip of uh lights or something .
B :  Yeah , something like that , yeah .
D :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Well , uh I think it's nice , for one thing . maybe put something on top of it or , you know , like that's looks funny . I don't know .
B :  No . No .
A :  Or some bump . Maybe some Yeah ?
D :  I think I think that'll be too big tha too big then .
B :  Bumper or something .
A :  We'll have to think about it . I think we're we're done .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yes , we are .
A :  We can save this one .
D :  Alright . Yes , I guess it's lunch time .
B :  Lunch break .
B :  Okay then .
A :  Mm mm .
D :  I don't know .
D :  Half and hour ? I thought our next uh next individual round was half an hour .
B :  Okay , five uh
A :  Yeah , that was what uh
D :  I don't know about the lunch break .
A :  Mm , we'll hear about it .
D :  Well
B :  Oh .
B :  .
D :  Great man . Who starts ?
A :  Well I'll uh start just with another presentation , so then we can uh look at th at the agenda uh for this meeting .
D :  Alright , great .
D :  Alright .
A :  Okay .
A :  I've put some uh new things in the in the map .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh oh .
A :  This is it .
A :  I don't know the shortcut , so Ah F_ five . Well our functional design meeting , that's the stage we're in . And you also ha all three of you have uh prepared something about it .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yes .
A :  Well um in we'll uh just have a look at the at the notes from the previous meeting , what we uh thought we had dec decided . But uh
A :  Uh then we'll uh look at uh the three uh presentations uh from you .
D :  'Kay .
A :  I think you have prepared uh all three uh ? Um we'll look at th the new project requirements we uh I dunno . Y you also have uh received that mail , the new project requirements from our bosses ?
C :  Well , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  No .
D :  No . You're the only one .
A :  Oh I've received a mail with uh some additional requirements , and I'll have a look if Well I think we should show them before your presentations , because it's not really uh
C :  Oh .
D :  Alright .
A :  smart uh to uh to include some things uh we can't , because of the new requirements . Well um then we can make some decisions about our remote control functions . We have to deb we have to decide it in this meeting what our function will be .
D :  'Kay .
A :  And then uh we can discuss uh some more closely . Uh
C :  We have forty minutes for this uh discussion ?
A :  Uh yeah , I think so . Well uh the closing uh we'll not uh look at it yet .
C :  Alright .
D :  Alright .
A :  Um now I'll look at show this board .
A :  Um
A :  Well uh notes , first meeting .
A :  Now .
A :  I gave a disc a a presentation . Uh we familiarised ourself with the boards and then we discussed some first ideas . So
A :  we said that uh
A :  we have to merge the strong points from our uh competitors , and uh look at their uh remote controls . We should make it uh compatible with our new D_V_D_ and other releases we have , our technical releases . Uh not too many one buttons . One recognisable button in the middle , where you do the most important functions with . And um well they can have two functions , because uh you have a D_V_D_ and a television .
D :  Right .
C :  Huh ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um the design has to fit the hand , be original , but also be familiar .
A :  It's uh one of our ideas . Yeah well that wa It's just thirty minutes ago , so it's not quite uh But well I have to do it . The materials uh well should be hard plastic with rubber from , and uh well the labelling of the buttons should be indestructible .
C : 
C :  Mm-hmm , now it's right .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It should be uh recognisable at all times . Yes . Well fronts were to be just like mobile telephones .
C :  It's meant to be easily wiped out , yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
A :  And uh the technical aspects um And also labelling of the buttons , the functions should be universal standards . Well that's just uh some ideas from the first meeting . It's quite logical al all of it .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um now the new project requirements , I'll just show them . I got this mail
A :  from uh our bosses . Well , teletext goes out . We will not use teletext .
B :  Oh .
D :  Okay .
C :  I I disagree , but uh it's not uh t it's not my place to disagree I guess .
A :  Maybe a new sort of thing , but n but not teletext . Well
A :  the second is a bit
A :  sh pity because we just said we wanted to d include the D_V_D_ and they don't want it , because of our time we have for this project .
B :  Oh .
D :  Alright .
C :  Oh , alright .
B :  Oh , that's a shame .
A :  So that's a shame , because uh especially for the third requirement we want to reach people under the thirty years .
A :  Because uh we don't have those customers a lot at th at this point . Um well it's a bit pity because it's just those people want to have uh one remote control for all those technical devices they can uh reach it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But let's forget about it . It's just time-consuming , so we uh have to go on .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well and uh our corporate image should stay rec recognisable in our products . So uh we have to uh use uh maybe a slogan , maybe a colour , and um Yeah well uh on our remote controls the design has to be uh , well as we already said a actually , uh familiar . Uh not only just uh the shape but also our company .
D :  Yes .
C :  Yeah , we are a real fashionable company . I read uh I read it on the I didn't know what company we were , but we we design uh especially trendy uh trendy trendy stuff . So it has to be uh a modern design . That's important to know , uh when you design a thing of course .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yes . I I uh noted uh our uh slogan that we have , our company . It's uh we mm put the fashion in electronics .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  So maybe that's a slogan we can put uh somewhere on our remote control or something . Alright then um we're going to uh have three presentations . You want to start ? Oh you have to start ? I didn't see anything about uh who had to start . Well s then start .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . I think I have to start . Oh no , no problem . I I just have to uh to think which file's mine , 'cause I was uh bit in a hurry .
C :  The order ? No .
B :  Mm .
A :  Okay . Well uh
D :  I think it's this one .
D :  But I'm not sure .
A :  You already uh opened uh PowerPoint .
D :  Hmm ? Yeah . S
D :  Right .
D :  Yes . This is it . Well , I'm going to tell you something about functional requirements . Um to start with these points . Uh next sheet ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um at first I tell you something about what people dislike about the current uh controls , because it's uh a smart thing to exclude those things . Uh , furthermore it's very important what they do like and what they do use .
D :  Um then I tell something about um the most important issues . So we have to focus on those three thing three things . And in the end I'll um show you our target audience or our target product users , customers .
D :  Well , um the first findings are that people um
D :  think most controls are very kind of ug ugly .
D :  That's seventy five per cent of the current users . They don't like it , so we might think about fronts in that section . Um
D :  They also say , that's about uh I thought it was fifty per cent , uh that more money will be spent on uh better looking controls . So it's very important that you design a a nice looking control .
D :  Um the current user uses his machine just about
D :  well all of the time for a few functions . Uh , almost every user uses it d the the control for just ten per cent of its capacity . So it's really important to make the the buttons for the common uh tasks kind of big or kind of uh flashy .
D :  Furthermore , it's uh seventy five per cent of the users uh zaps a lot . Thus it might be uh might be smart to make a a big uh zapping button or something in the middle , so you can reach it with your thumb . Yeah , yeah right .
C :  You can zap away . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
D :  A lot of losers um users lose their controls in their in their living room . So it might be sensible to make some kind of a button on your television , that's your um your control beeps or something , that you can find this very easily . I dunno , maybe that's an idea . 'Cause it's uh a big I think fifty per cent of the users loses his its control , within the same room . So
B :  Yeah .
A :  Well
C :  Oh .
C :  Oh ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  It should actually uh It should actually be loose from the television , because it can also be used for other televisions . So if you deliver a small uh click-on device that you can put on your television , that bleeps to your remote control , everyone can use it . No you can click it on your television .
D :  Yeah but what if you lose your click-on device ?
D :  Yeah but if someone d somebody else uses it in ano other room or something ?
A :  Yeah in another room , yeah . Well yes .
D :  Nee but it it specifically says it's uh the the control is lost in the same room .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So
D :  Well a beeping device would be Uh furthermore the learning time is a problem . Uh thirty four thirty four per cent um thinks it's it's too uh too difficult to learn . So the the learning curve should be very short uh for the dumbest people should be able to use it .
A :  Well we'll have a look at it , yeah .
C :  I think our uh user uh expert should also consider manual a manual for the remote , of course . Uh
D :  Yeah but people don't read manuals .
C :  I didn't read it ? Oh , alright . users to uh add one ? Do you think ?
D :  No .
B :  No .
B :  I don't think
D :  I think you should put more time in the in the design of uh pick up and use , than a manual .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm . Yeah alright . Because they don't use it ? Alright .
B :  Yes you should You should could take a look at it and and and know how it how it's supposed to work .
A :  Yep .
D :  Yeah . Right .
A :  Well there sh should always be a menu , but it c can be very short .
D :  And it should be consistent with consistent with older remotes .
B :  Yeah but nobody reads a manual about a remote control , I think .
A :  Yes okay .
C :  Well maybe for the If you don't recognise a button who d who d who do I call uh wh when I don't know it ?
D :  Alright .
B :  Yeah right . It sh it should be there , the manual . But but not to explain how the remote works . Only
D :  And we don't have much time . So it's better to uh put our attention to the the design . So you can pick up and use it , than I think .
A :  Well we are a design team , we can say to some uh writer uh make a manual point .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah right , right .
C :  Isn't it part of the of the u No . No . Never mind .
A :  Well we'll have a look . Um yes ?
D :  Next point . Um R_S_I_ . Well that's about twenty per cent I thought . But uh the designer should uh take it uh should uh Wie zeg ik dat ? Yeah , consider the consequences of using your remote . It should be a good in your hand .
C :  Consider the m
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
D :  Right , this is the most important part . Um , we're Like the requirements said , we're gonna specify of we're gonna target a younger audience . Um , that's about sixty per cent of the market , so it's uh quite important . Um research shows that they like to have a little L_C_D_ screen on their on their uh zapping uh device . Uh
A :  Well
D :  I thought it was the age between sixteen and twenty , ninety nine per cent of uh the people like that . So it's very important we should definitely have that in our uh designs .
A :  Well with twelve Euro fifty as production cost , we can't uh afford an L_C_D_ uh
C :  It's going to be expensive . Yeah .
B :  No .
D :  Yeah but they think it's really important . So if we want to s If we have a big
A :  Yeah .
D :  If we make lots of uh of the stuff , maybe we can uh buy it very cheap , I dunno . We have to uh
C :  Well we'll uh consider it uh .
A :  Well Yeah well uh it's your your task to uh look into the costs uh of those uh Nigh I know .
C :  We'll think abo we'll think
D :  Yeah , I don't know . I don't have any information on that . So
C :  No , we'll look we'll look into that later . Alright ?
D :  Right . And uh another thing is uh speech uh recognition . They also like that , but research is very uh costly . So
B :  I think that's uh difficult to realise also .
D :  Yeah , but
D :  it it might be important for the sale .
C :  We have very demanding clients .
A :  It's not yet a standard uh development uh those so
B :  No and we have customers in multiple uh countries I think .
D :  Well I do think L_C_D_ is more reachable than the speech recognition . So we might consider L_C_D_ screens .
A :  We sh
A :  Yeah absolutely .
B :  Yeah .
B :  No .
C :  Yeah , yeah , alright . Well we'll consider both and and see what uh what what we can find , I think . We don't rule them out uh yet .
D :  Alright .
A :  Yep .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Alright . Um , I think that's it . Um
A :  Alright .
D :  I think
D :  it is sensible
D :  to u uh to take this take these points into the notes . So you can Right .
A :  Yes .
A :  Well you I c I can uh still see your presentation .
D :  Yeah . Right .
A :  It's in the Well uh next um I dunno who is next . You uh got uh
C :  Shall I give a technical talk ? Alright .
B :  Oh you go .
A :  Yes . Well go ahead .
C :  Well uh it is my task to uh explain uh or to point out a working design .
A :  Yip .
C :  We have that here . Okay , how do you enlarge it , so that you can have the F_ F_ five .
A :  F_ five .
A :  F_ five .
C :  Yep . Well , the working design , that's my uh
D :  Alright . Next button .
C :  Well alright uh , you know who I am and what I do . So uh we have this . It's a bit uh unclear because I wanted to copy paste something . It was originally in black and white but it became black and purple . But I think you can read it . Um well um I think it's important uh for you to realise the basic function of a remote control . Uh well you can see uh
D :  Oh right .
D :  Purple .
B : 
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . A bit .
D :  Maybe you can select it . So it uh inverts .
C :  And I then can select I can select on the dings It goes to the next page .
D :  the p the whole picture . Nah , uh never mind .
A :  Click .
C :  Well , you can read it , it's not too difficult . Meanwhile , this is a schematic uh um view of uh how a basic remote control works . You have uh basically uh the energy , the power of the of the remote control , uh and the sender , w which is the LED , the the the the the the the the the bulb that sends the the infrared beam to the , no , to the set .
B :  Yeah , go ahead .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Alright .
C :  And uh the source is of course the user . Uh the user interface is um uh the the the buttons of course . And the the user interface sends uh the the different signals of the different buttons to the chip , and the chip uh sends it to the LED , and the LED sends it to the receiver . That's the that's the basic idea . Very basic .
A :  Yep .
C :  Um well I have uh uh put it in a in in in a a couple of basic steps . Uh the remote uh is basically just waiting for a user to press a key . It does nothing until uh of course uh the key is pressed .
C :  The key a signal to a chip , uh the chip senses the connection . uh and recognise the key . So well you understand . The chip uh produces Morse code , um a specific code to indicate that specific button that is pressed , of course . And it uses transistors in the in the remote control to amplify and to send uh that signal again to the to the LED , which is the bulb , of course .
C :  Now the LED produces an infrared beam and signals the , well it's uh very simple , and signals the uh signals to the sensor on the T_V_ set , and the T_V_ set uh also recognises the the the signal , and performs the assigned task .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So it is also why we have to have a button that says uh I'm now busy with a D_V_D_ uh if we had done that . And a button for T_V_ . So
C :  Ah bu Yeah , but we don't . Uh we No no , but Yeah . Exactly . Uh well this is uh the basic uh function of a remote . I've some couple of pictures here . It's a very basic one . And uh if we if we're going to add an uh an uh L_C_D_ screen to it , it uh won't look anything like this , but
C :  This is very basic uh basically the the shape of um of a remote control . It has uh very little buttons and But it it uh it's it's quite um Yeah , you can easily recognise the buttons . They're uh far enough apart and an anything . It's not very um
B :  High tech .
C :  uh not very high-tech uh indeed , and it's not very user-friendly . Uh if you look at the shape , it's uh just a simple long box uh shape . So we have to uh change a little bit uh to that , uh so that uh it becomes more user-friendly , and that uh problems like uh R_S_I_ and uh those kinds of thing don't don't oc don't occur . Yeah .
D :  Right .
D :  Can I say something ? Um I have a table here about uh the l the relevance of the buttons . Uh the power button is used very much , channel selection , volume and teletext . Well teletext is not an option , so that uh But I think it's very important to make um the power , channel and volume buttons uh near to the thumb , so you can't have R_S_I_ uh consequences .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , because they are the the most important buttons and you can immediately
D :  Right . Make them big , make them easy to uh to press .
A :  Well but but if you have um the most used buttons all in one place , and you keep making the same um well moves . But if y if you would put it at a different place , then you have to move your hands , and that's on of the things about R_S_I_ .
C :  You don't have to look and and search for them .
B :  You can also like
D :  Right .
D :  Yeah , right . Right .
B :  Yeah , I was thinking you can
D :  Yeah , that's right . That's right . That's right . We
B :  Are some of the the the um
C :  Well you you can't have any uh every button under the thumb , of course .
A :  No but the most important buttons m maybe you can just put them a bit apart so you would
D :  But
D :  Yeah . That's very important . And
A :  reject R_ R_S_I_ R_S_I_ .
B :  Maybe you can make , for for channel changing , two little buttons on the side of the remote , so you can just do like this . Like some uh little uh Gameboy things or some Hmm ?
A :  Yes I've saw that on m on mi mobile telephones they also have uh those buttons .
D :  But is that is that useable ? Do people , uh when they pick up a remote , know that they have to do that ?
D :  It's a f it's a new feature , you can make make a double feature l like a button on the top and under it .
B :  Well
A :  Well it it's
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah alright , but
B :  Yeah , but if you s say them up and down , they they'll understand it , I think . Eighty per cent would .
A :  Well also i if someone puts picks up his uh remote
A :  Yeah . If someone puts up i uh picks up his remote , and he picks up it he he touches the side then he's a already on the next channel . That's very irritating , I think . Well . No .
C :  Well , .
D :  Yeah , he feels it immediately . Yeah , that's right . Yeah .
B :  Yeah that's true .
B :  Yeah but
D :  Right , continue . Sorry .
C :  But in e in any case the the basic function should be uh indeed , and as you say at the thumb . I think that's a good idea , and uh and that the less important uh buttons , like the the the different channels , uh the numbers one two three four five as well , should be uh yeah well not in reach , because uh they don't use it uh all the time .
C :  Well it's uh pretty pretty basically uh as you said . And I have some pictures of the inside workings , but uh I don't want to get too technical , because uh that's not uh very uh useful for you .
A :  Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , that's right .
A :  That's your part of the job .
C :  So yeah exactly this is uh how it uh looks from the inside . And uh well that's about it I think . Oh yeah , I still have this . Oh I had to delete this , but I had to make a schematic uh of the of the new But I had too too little time , but uh don't uh
A :  Yep .
D :  Alright .
A :  Okay . Well we understand . We understand . Oh right , no .
C :  don't look at it please . I I think it's it's clear uh how it works . Alright . That's the most important thing .
D :  Alright .
D :  Yeah , it's clear .
A :  Nice .
C :  Alright . Uh
A :  Then uh Mike can uh give the third presentation .
C :  Right .
A :  How late is did we start his presentation uh ?
D :  I dunno . I think uh w
A :  Wha Yeah .
D :  About twenty minutes ago ?
D :  Losing time losing time .
A :  Well then we have still the time , so But we do have to come to a decision , right later on .
D :  Yeah right . So
A :  So
B :  Mm .
B :  Well I thought um everybody on the website uh would see the same thing , but
D :  I don't think so .
B :  obviously that's not the case .
C :  Yeah , uh there are different uh We have all have different home pages , with different links . Yeah .
A :  Oh yeah ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah right .
A :  Uh ?
B :  For instance you couldn't see this .
A :  Okay , yeah well .
B :  Um
B :  Yeah . Well I'm Mike , User Interface Designer .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  The the method ? Well
B :  I used my own experience with remotes , took a good l look uh at the remotes on the corporate website , which are these two . Um
A :  Yeah .
D :  These are already in use ?
B :  Yes , these are from from another uh manufacturer . Um
D :  Alright , okay .
B :  This one is engineering-centred , so this one has the most functions and um things . This one is user-centred .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um
D :  Well Yeah , me too .
A :  I like user-centred . Yeah .
B :  I like user-centr centred uh uh also the best .
A :  We also do that .
B :  Um
B :  Well , I thought uh that we uh reduce the the option to control the D_V_D_ also , and teletext and that kind of stuff .
D :  Mm .
B :  Uh so I thought we we we would use more or need more buttons than this one . But
D :  But we have to reject that , because of the requirements ?
B :  Yes . Th that's why this mm is not relevant any more I feel . Um
A :  Yeah .
D :  Alright .
B :  I think this is about the maximum number of buttons uh we'll need .
D :  Yeah , right .
B :  I um I kinda like the shape . I think this is what we talked about . But
D :  Yeah .
C :  You can't really see uh the differ from different sides . But I think uh
B :  No I've Well I showed it somewhere . Um
C :  Uh you can draw it if you Yeah .
B :  Oh yeah . I think we should go further with the idea of a removable front . So we can can uh yeah customise the
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well absolutely , but i th they all have to have something about um the recognition from our company . So we cannot just uh
B :  Mm ?
B :  Yeah . It's a front . It's not the the whole remote that changes , of course . You can
A :  make someone w
A :  No but that's th the side they look uh look at is the front . So if y if you make a a front with just a a tiger on it , then uh our recognition is totally gone .
D :  But it
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , that's right .
B :  Or you can you can can put the same symbol on on every remote . So l like Ericsson does every uh
D :  Yeah , that's a must . We must have that .
A :  Yeah , we must . Yeah well and and
C :  We can put it on the on the back side .
B :  S something like this . It's recognisable .
A :  Yes .
A :  'Kay .
D :  We can make a symbol of the company right here . And if you put a front on it , there's a hole on the front . So the symbol's always on Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  Yeah ?
C :  Yeah , so that you don't replace the symbol , yeah .
B :  Yeah yeah . Something like that , in the Yeah .
A :  Yeah yeah yeah . Or the th the the lowest part of the remote isn't changed by the front . Those kind of things . Yes . Okay .
D :  Yeah , yeah . But let's not focus on the front .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um Well so uh uh like I said I thought we'd we'd use more function . If we we had to include more functions . But we don't . So um
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . I think this is about the maximum number of buttons we need . Maybe some less . Like eject we don't need , and some other buttons we don't need . I think uh
D :  Alright .
C :  Mike , uh can you put uh that picture from me on the in the Word documents file ? In Map ?
B :  Yeah , I will . I think uh for the remote um uh less is more . The less buttons the better the design . Um
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I agree .
B :  We should go with that concept I think .
B :  I know .
A :  Alright .
D :  I've I've got another point . Um there are two target audi audiences , and we've uh chose for the younger one . Um , research has shown that um it's a high interested uh in features . They are high high interested in feature . But they are more critical . Fo Yeah , critical . So The younger audience . So we must um must design uh a control that really speaks to the people .
A :  Yeah ?
B :  Mm .
C :  The younger uh
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well what if we um I at I at home have a remote that has um the most familiar uh buttons on the top , and the bottom side of the front has a little clip , a f a little uh You can click away and then you have f much more functions that most people don't use but s some do do .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm . I think uh the most functions uh underneath that uh uh No um mm usually
D :  Clip aren't used much .
A :  Well but because you say they their features are important , they want m um a lot , but not
D :  Yeah right .
C :  But
B :  Yeah , but what kind of features ? Like L_C_D_ screens and voice recognition . But I've
C :  Yeah I think m most
D :  Yeah but Yeah .
D :  Here , look at these numbers . The newest features are , like I said , are uh L_C_D_ and uh speech uh control .
C :  Most uh
D :  Our audience , these people , are very like these uh features . You see ? So we must build in something , or they will to uh go to the concurrent . The concurrent ? Competitors , right . So , I do think we have to uh have some features .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm . Uh .
A :  Competitors .
C :  Yeah . Our competitor . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well maybe w we could uh s On um some uh calculators you have lo those little little L_C_D_ th that you can click on or something , or that you can click uh out uh of the remote . And if if that's gives you a little bit of sta status information . Yeah .
D :  Even though they cost a little more .
D :  Right . Right .
D :  Like a ticker-tape . Which programme you are l watching or something .
B :  Yeah , that's nice .
A :  Those kind of things , uh because you also have those uh those program recognition for your V_ V_C_R_s .
A :  And uh well if y if your remote picks that up also , you they can display which programme you're currently watching .
D :  Yeah , right . Yeah right .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . So it it just signals the the different uh sig uh the different symbols on the screen you have , uh because if you change to s channel two you have two on the screen and two on your on your um on your L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Yeah .
A :  For example .
A :  It it could be such a little uh th that you can click in and out and you and you have it .
B :  Yeah , we should keep that simple too . It will
C :  But should it uh really be uh clickable , uh or or just integrate inside to try to make it d more trendy .
A :  Yeah .
D :  No not clickable . Nah , no no no . Yeah , just at at the top . So when you s you sit like this you can can watch . I think it should be at the top .
A :  Well maybe .
B :  No , it should be uh integrated . I think
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , something like on um some radios in car . You Where it's , yeah , walking to Yeah .
D :  Yeah right . It's a ticker-tape idea .
A :  R_D_S_s or something .
C :  But that's of course uh a bit more uh expensive than uh the basic uh calculator design , with the scrolling text and that kind of thing .
B :  Wa Yeah .
D :  Well it's just one script .
A :  Well I think it's you got It just means it's a script that's uh keeps it uh rolling , and it's not uh That's five minutes off uh implementing time I think uh
D :  Yeah , five minutes of ja ja for programming . So I don't think that's the issue .
A :  Yeah .
A :  No .
C :  Alright .
D :  Alright , we go with the L_C_D_ screen ?
A :  Uh well I think so , yes . Um
B :  Yeah well we we we still need to know how much that will cost .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Right , I don't know if I can find that , but
A :  We're g No but we're we'll have to look into that .
B :  Or maybe you will get that information uh Yeah .
D :  Next time . Yeah right .
A :  Um we can use this board again , I think . Uh we can put some um decisions about um the controls we want , th the issue . Where is my presentation ? Uh
D :  Yeah , I understand what you're saying .
A :  Uh
D :  We should have a general idea of how it's gonna look .
A :  Well
A :  I mean we're all here now , I think . These I've already given you . So we have to decide on the different remote control functions .
D :  Right .
A :  So we want to have a small L_C_D_ screen that's special .
D :  At the top .
C :  Shouldn't we start with the most important parts ? The L_C_D_ screen alright but we should start with the power button ? Uh
B :  At the top or at the bottom ?
A :  Yes .
D :  I think the top is more uh
A :  Yeah .
D :  When you s How do you zap ? You just sit in your chair ?
B :  Yeah but
C :  Huh ?
B :  Yeah but with with the L_C_D_ screen on the top it gets a bit unnatural . 'Cause most remotes have some space left at the bottom .
D :  With the remote ?
A :  That thing is terrible .
D :  Yeah but that's where your hand ball might be . Yeah , I dunno .
A :  Uh
B :  Yeah , no Mm .
C :  And then uh
D :  We'll draw two , and then we'll see uh
C :  Maybe we should uh centralise the discussion here . I dunno what uh you were talking about but
D :  No Um he thinks Yeah , right . He thinks it's better to put the L_C_D_ at the bottom , and I think it's better at the top .
C :  we are busy with something .
C :  Uh-huh . Why do you think it's better at the bottom ?
A :  Well
B :  Uh well because most uh remotes have um some space left at the bottom , and that way you can keep the shape recognisable for everybody . I c
D :  But your
C :  But you just can put uh the the the the the whole interface a bit down , so that there's room for the for the interface .
D :  Yeah . The the ticker The L_C_D_ is like like small . It's it's wide . It's not not high . But
B :  Well I d I think that's that's ugly but
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  I th
A :  Well I th I think Mike Mike has a point , because um when when uh when I use a remote I l I hate the buttons but buttons at the at the bottom . So and and I I like to use the ones
C :  And and we can
B :  Yeah . Power button always Yeah .
C :  Bottom .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , y you gotta zap like this or you want to Yeah .
A :  on the top . So when I u when I have to have an L_C_D_ s scr window
D :  Yeah right . But
C :  Well that's a bit exaggerated . Well , I agree with you .
D :  We're making a remote with with a few functions you know . We
C :  It's it's also more recognisable . It looks more like a calculator to people , if you have the l the the
A :  Yes but we we we we don't want that . We don't want them to look like a calculator . We want to look it like our original but familiar
C :  the thing on top .
B :  Yeah you don't want You want uh Yeah it it it must be a remote .
C :  Yeah w well , but uh you don't have to throw uh um important aspe important aspect like familiarity uh completely away , uh because I think it's uh
B :  Yeah .
D :  High-tech .
A :  Yea
A :  Maybe a bic uh better uh white uh We White ?
C :  I think it's still important to have it at the top , because it's uh
D :  Width .
A :  Width . Uh format yeah format ? Line width ? Width ?
D :  Th that's not a problem . When I draw here it Oh . Huh ?
C :  it's more familiar that way .
A :  Yeah ?
A :  It's a bit off . Well .
D :  Yeah , it's off .
C :  A little a little bit .
D :  It it needs to be calibrated again . Well
A :  Well uh let's uh talk about that later uh
C :  Maybe you should another pen . Maybe that's uh better .
D :  Where ?
C :  You e you only have one pen for that screen . Yeah .
A :  It's special pen .
D :  Alright , we have to make a decision now , because we don't have much time . Um
A :  Yeah . No .
D :  I think we have uh a few functions , and we can put uh the L_C_D_ above it , and still have lots of room at the bottom , where you can put your hand .
C :  Yeah . I I agree .
A :  I think it should be at the button , bottom .
C :  Well I'm the I I'm the designer , so um
B :  At the bottom ? In a few minutes Oh yeah , oh yeah , I totally agree . Yeah .
A :  Bottom . The L_C_D_ .
D :  At the bot
A :  Yeah .
D :  So
D :  We are two uh V_S_ two .
A :  Well but uh what what if we we first decide the different functions , and then look at the design . Because we have to decide this .
B :  He's the boss .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Right . Great .
C :  Uh we uh we were busy with that . Uh yeah we should uh summon the the different uh aspects of the thing . So , we have the power button .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And moreover I think that you two should be uh come to consensus about the L_C_D_ s . It's uh your it's your job .
A :  Yes .
C :  Yeah of course . Uh it's uh . Yeah . W wh
A :  Well we have a power button . Guys ?
B :  No it's our job . For all of us I think .
C :  While you have to agree , I can say it's like this and you must agree . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , right .
A :  Guys ? We have a power button , setting buttons , L_C_D_ window , the number buttons
D :  Alright , let's keep it central .
B :  The ten numbers ? Yeah ?
C :  Channel , yeah .
A :  Uh
B :  Volume ?
C :  Volume control .
A :  Yes .
C :  Um
D :  Mm .
C :  Well let's look at your uh design . Uh
A :  Uh the mute button . I h love that one .
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  I think we we should use something like this um to um
B :  The the channel up and channel down button ? Yeah , in circle , you know ?
A :  Yes .
A :  Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah . Well that's that's also design .
B :  And and a volume control also in it .
A :  Yes .
D :  Right .
A :  Um
C :  Yeah . But th th on this remote th these controls are for something else , a D_V_D_ player or something . So
A :  Well h ho
A :  Yes . Yes . They are for some uh video uh
B :  Yes , as I already said , we could drop some of these buttons .
D :  You should put that uh power button , channel and volume should have the most uh importance .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think these should be in one big circle in the middle .
D :  Yeah , but what he said about R_S_I_
D :  was t kinda true . When when you uh put them all in the same place , the most used buttons , you're doing the same thing all the time , and that's just what R_S_I_'s all about . So it might be smarter to put them a little more away from each other .
A :  Apart .
A :  So people have to move their hand . And they get less uh complaints of R_S_I_ .
C :  Yeah , it's it's also not good to completely stay in one position constantly with one hand . Y Yeah . It's good to move uh from time to time . Yeah .
A :  That's what I always do , because all my i important buttons are the same place .
B :  Yeah but people don't like it when their buttons are all over the place . They they need to be centred .
A :  Yes ?
D :  Um
C :  No but now y W would we have to choose a
A :  Well not
D :  Frequency of uh button use . Um channels are uh most uh is most used within the hour . You can see . So the the channel uh channel buttons should be far far apart , I think , up and down .
C :  way in middle ?
A :  Yes .
B :  Volume hardly .
A :  Uh-huh .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  No I don't think .
C :  Oh . Far apart ?
A :  Up and down far apart from each other ?
D :  You thinking uh about R_S_I_ ?
B :  Yeah but
B :  Yeah but No .
D :  Y look at uh look at the frequency . Nei not too much , but
A :  Well not too much .
C : 
B :  The other the other two uh frustrations are far more important . So
C :  I think you can have the two buttons of up and down close together , but you don't have uh have to have volume control and and zapping button close together .
A :  Well for example the power button , you can If someone is constantly z zapping , it's not going to miss , that it that the power button is not right beside it . Because I have someone But the buttons is way . So that one can be put away .
B :  Well they are used four times an hour , so
D :  Nei nei nei n I I totally agree . But just
D :  Yeah . Right .
D :  Yeah . I agree .
A :  The power button can uh be uh uh
B :  Power bu button should be left at the top .
D :  And should and should be red .
A :  Yes . Oh man , five minutes .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , well five minutes left . Yep .
D :  Right , just make some decisions .
D :  The most important things we have to uh
A :  Um how are we going to do it with those numbers ?
C :  C c can you make you make We can use uh the drawing board now , I think . Uh it it doesn't work well but But it it would be pretty pretty uh nice if we could just draw a simple thing .
A :  Well I have it here .
D :  I do think you have to keep you have to keep it central now . Just uh you decide that , you decide that , and ready .
A :  Yeah well that's going to take too too much time . Yes .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
C :  Mm . Alright .
A :  Yes .
A :  Well the L_C_D_ . Um you are Industrial , you are User Interface . So I think it's going to go to Mike . But you will have to make consensus with . Well
D :  Yeah .
B :  Well consensus , um We we can put it in the middle , so
A :  Well it's a bit hard , because we are going to be uh individually . That's a bit uh
D :  Nei . We're No We're deciding now , so
A :  Yes .
D :  Top or bottom ?
C :  Well uh yeah I I still think it's it's quite important though to uh to have it at the top , so Yeah . You say familiarity isn't important but
A :  Yes it is .
A :  Well what if we're going to now decide about the functions , and the design comes into the next round ?
D :  Okay .
A :  Plus the d th the design round is still to come huh ?
C :  Yeah d
D :  Yeah , right . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Alright .
A :  Alright these functions . The number f Well yes , that's alright . W the number function . Are we going to uh do it like uh on Mike's screen with uh one button that says I'm going to do a t two number digital ?
C :  As we we we we agreed , we do have a L_C_D_ . So that's
D :  Yeah , okay .
C :  that's enough . Yeah .
B :  No .
A :  How do you want it to do then ?
C :  There's one two three four five six six seven eight nine zero .
B :  Well just when you push a one one and
A :  It it has to r recognise one as there could still come more .
B :  No , if you On most T_V_s if you uh press two numbers shortly after each other , d it Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Oh , like that . Um
A :  Yes .
C :  They'd recognise it . Th that's the most That that's very easy . Yeah .
A :  Alright so no button for that .
D :  No .
A :  Okay uh anyone any uh oth other functionalities of our uh remote ?
C :  I think these are the the most important functions .
D :  Do you still have the pictures over there ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  So
D :  Yeah , that's about it .
D :  You do need the uh multi Or did uh No , like this one . You do need them ? Yeah , I know . But are we
A :  No , we'd uh just said we didn't uh
D :  Alright , alright uh Now okay .
A :  Well uh
A :  Um well because we can't integrate it with any other uh remotes , all those buttons on those pictures are uh irrelevant . So just for a television is that all we need ?
D :  Right .
D :  Yeah , it's most useable this way .
C :  basic function .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Teletext is gone . So all those buttons that ar are to do with teletext Oh screen placing .
A :  We'll have uh those uh buttons about uh
A :  And uh the two important ones we're l f forgetting . Uh there's um screen . You can make it wider and less wide . And the button that you can go to A_V_ for your video .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Right . I do think we have to put that underneath a clip .
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  Those two ? But it's just two , and we make a clip ?
C :  Uh just two just two under uh under uh
A :  Th that's a bit uh waste .
B :  We we can make make uh a little row of like four buttons down here .
A :  Yes .
D :  Yeah . Okay , right .
C :  I I think uh
A :  Or at the top . Your L_C_D_ screen is going to go .
B :  Or at Yeah alright then .
C :  But you you can put uh two or three buttons under uh another section . Uh that's that's too complicated . You can just put it somewhere They they aren't used much , not as much as those other , so you can put it somewhere
A :  Yes .
B :  Oh , they can be small or round like buttons .
C :  Yeah s bit smaller and s Well uh and and I think more at the bottom . Yeah .
C :  Yeah or at the top , yeah . What do you think uh those those buttons ? Above or down ?
A :  Well I think they should in an in an isolated part of the remote .
C :  And w where ? Well we design it later . We have it , and we design later where everything goes . Yeah .
A :  Yes ? Yes . Yes . Well any other uh
D :  Well if you you take those th If you
B :  Why go to video ?
A :  Go to video , that's always on your remote control . To A_V_ uh to A_V_ A_V_ A_V_ .
D :  Yeah , but you can z you can zap t you can you can zap to the video channel from zero to uh
C :  The the video channel uh ?
B :  That's just zero . Yeah .
C :  No no not always . Ze yeah zero is a different channel than uh the the video channel .
A :  Well l n no not at not at my remote .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but you can can zap down
D :  Yeah , but when you zap down zero you get to A_V_ .
A :  Yes .
B :  Yes , I think th
A :  I don't . I go to ninety-nine .
B :  No , then you press ninety nine . I think go to video is
D :  Ah uh well whatever , .
B :  an irrelevant button , but
A :  Th that's the button uh No .
C :  But it's easy to go If you are at uh at channel uh fifty five and you want to uh go immediately to the video channel , you do you have to push a to to get below zero . It's more easy to get to uh where the specific uh video channel button .
A :  No you can ch push zero . Yeah . Yeah , I I think that one button is uh I use it uh
D :  Yeah , but if we're choosing to uh incorporate these buttons , you have to have uh channel setting , if you wa if you have a new T_V_ . You have to set the channels . Right all th these uh different buttons you have to
A :  Yeah ?
A :  These buttons , I don't have buttons for channel setting uh especially on my remote .
D :  Ah , I do .
C :  Yeah well uh d different screen settings a Yeah , sk Yeah y you you you you have screen width .
A :  It's it's incorporated with p m plus and down , uh those
B :  Yeah well y you must have .
B :  Yeah you yeah you have one one button from s set frequency o or something , and then with plus and min minus you can uh adjust the uh
D :  Right . That's the only one we put uh in there .
A :  So we still have one uh four ?
D :  For a screen uh fu uh channel setting .
A :  Ch ch
C :  Yeah to uh oh yeah of course to configure the programme the Yeah .
D :  Programme , right .
A :  Okay . Oh the Okay button ? Oh you always have in the centre an Okay button , for your menu . Menu button .
D :  Uh
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , alright .
C :  You should Yeah . I think that's important . Uh And and the settings to change the brightness the settings to change the brightness and the contrast .
A :  Channel , setting , menu . We have to go .
A :  Okay .
C :  Channel , yeah .
A :  So um Save .
C :  Chief ?
C :  Chief ?
A :  Yes see .
C :  Th the menu menu button is also important . Then you can uh
A :  Yes I have put it in .
C :  Where ? I don't see it . Oh Menu , alright .
A :  Here .
B :  I think things like uh contrast and brightness should be um in the menu , yeah .
C :  In the menu . And you can uh then adjust it with the zapping buttons or something . Because uh the zapping buttons aren't used then if you are in the menu . Yeah . Or the volume , yeah .
B :  Yeah , the
A :  Alright .
B :  Or the volume or something like that .
A :  Guys ? We're going to uh go to our uh rooms , and uh we'll have to decide s things on our own I think . So
B :  Your pen .
D :  Ah . Great .
C :  Yes chief .
D :  Alright .
B :  I thought we'd uh lunch uh right now , or not ?
A :  Well see you uh W w we have lunchtime , by the way , now uh so uh
C :  Yeah this is this is your thing .
D :  Ah . Okay .
B :  Yeah , lunch break .
C :  I am hungry .
A :  Lunch .
D :  Get into my belly .
A :  Ah . We didn't exactly do everything but So
B : 
C :  See you later mate .
A :  Okay . So welcome back . What do do we have to do ?
D :  .
A :  So first . I want to say I'm the secretary , so I make the minutes . You find them in your in the map in the
A :  From the group . There's the minutes from the first meeting . You'll find the next minutes also there .
A :  Then
A :  I wanna hear from you , what you've done .
A :  And after that I have some new product requirements . So And after that we have to make decisions , what we will do . And then we're ready . We have forty minutes for this meeting . After that we'll have lunch . So first I wanna ask the
A :  Industrial Designer to tell what he did . So
C :  That's my task . Okay . Uh I've
C :  Where have I put it ? My Documents or not ?
C :  Hmm .
C :  I've save it on my computer , my presentation .
A :  Yeah on your computer , or the
C :  But where ?
A :  What's the name ?
C :  Uh uh uh
A :  What's the name of it ?
C :  It was about the working of the remote control .
A :  It's the technical function or the functional requirements .
C :  Nope .
C :  Not a of
C :  Wait .
C :  The working design . But I've saved it .
A :  Working design .
C :  But now I don't know where it is .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Working design . What is this ? Product documents .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And I import this until
A :  On the desktop .
A :  Up .
A :  up .
C :  One more .
A :  Up . Up .
A :  Up . Yes . My Documents .
A :  Nope .
C :  What the fuck is this ?
A :  Gone . Well you Um Nah . Nah , nah , nah .
A :  PowerPoint . Working design .
C :  Yeah that's the empty one .
A :  And
C :  I had one .
C :  Uh-huh .
A :  of working design .
C :  Open it .
C :  Okay here it is .
A :  Save as .
A :  Uh it's
D :  Desktop .
C :  Project .
A :  Project .
D :  Yeah . Okay . Well .
A :  Save .
C :  Okay .
A :  Very good .
C :  A little later but here it is .
A :  Okay .
A :  So
C :  So okay . It's a little difficult what I'm gonna tell you . It's about the working of the remote control . I just had an half an hour j to study it and I don't get it .
D :  Make it .
A :  Now have ten minutes to tell it .
C :  Ten minutes to tell it . Okay . I think it will be a few minutes and First uh I will tell you something about the findings , what I discovered about the remote control . The working bout it uh of it .
A :  Okay .
C :  Uh then I'll have uh some kind of map , and it's the top of the remote control . With a little bit of science , uh you I will show that uh in in a few minutes . And then uh what I'll think about it .
C :  First , the findings . The remote control is a very difficult uh thing to uh to explain to just all of you wh who haven't seen a remote control uh inside . Uh there's a lot of uh plastic on it , um because its uh not so expensive .
C :  And there are uh a lot of uh wires , uh which um connect the components in it , the battery , and there are um switches and things like that . There's a lot of small uh electronics . So it won't be um uh too expensive to build it . Only twelve Euro fifty I think uh we will make it .
C :  Now And here I have the top of the remote control . Uh here's some kind of chip . Uh on top of this , there are uh the numbers . Uh you have all on your remote control . And uh the teletext uh button . And uh here's the battery .
C :  And when you push the button , it will uh will be sent to the chip . And the chip will um send it to all kind of sub-components . That's what I said , it's very difficult . And after that it will be sent to the infrared . And that will send it to your television .
C :  That's a short h uh how it works . Uh I think I can uh make it uh difficult , but we all
C :  we all don't get it .
C :  My preferences ? It's uh it won't be uh We shouldn't make it too big .
C :  Uh also for the cost , uh we should only put one battery on it . A long-lasting battery . Uh also for the cost , uh use only plastic . Not other materials . Also because of the cost , uh not too much buttons on it .
C :  We can also make uh a button uh with a menu uh button . And then um that that you will see it on the T_V_ . And on the T_V_ you can uh switch into the menu . That's I think it's easier .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And the bleep signal , y uh you told us . Uh but we can also use it uh a bleep like something , when the battery's empty , then there is a bleep . Then you'll have to change it in a in a week or something . And also the bleep , when what I told you about uh when you lost it , and you push a button , and then you hear bleep bleep , and we will find it .
C :  This is uh just uh Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Oh oh . Two questions . The battery . You say one battery is cheaper . Why ?
C :  If we w if we use only just one uh small pen-light , then it will be cheaper than when we use two .
A :  Yeah but when you use two , you can use it two times longer .
C :  Yeah but then we'll have to make the um remote control uh long lasting . Just
A :  Okay so it's the size of the remote control . Okay and the buttons . When you use it on the television , you've you need the television , wh which can use it .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But uh I think this our remote control is for the televisions we uh we sell in our company ? Or is it also for other company uh for other televisions ?
A :  Okay .
A :  I think we have to use it also on other televisions though .
C :  Then this is an option . Maybe just a menu button to use it on our televisions . And then we make it easier uh for our televisions . And on the other tele televisions , you can also use it , but then we won't use the
A :  So
A :  Yeah but I don't I think it They are two different things though . We have to choose one .
A :  It has to work on o uh all televisions .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah ? Okay . Then I think uh the menu button uh will only work on the newer televisions .
C :  And we will uh look forward and don't make a remote control which for the older televisions .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  And I just uh have one more idea . Uh maybe it's one of your tasks . But Uh , to have a trendy remote control , we can also um make something like the Nokia um mobile phones . To change covers .
C :  So if you have uh a trendy half with all red , uh yellow and something . And then you can put a red cover on it . And also different things .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah . Good idea .
C :  Yes .
D :  Will this will this add to the cost ?
C :  Uh then it won't be uh will have just one cover on the uh original one . And then you can buy the covers .
D :  Yes but you have to m uh be able to change it . D does it make it more difficult to design ?
C :  I think it will be a little more difficult , but not too much .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Not much . 'Kay .
C :  Just like with the Nokia uh mobile phones . Just one .
A :  Yeah but there are much more Nokia telephones than um these ones .
C :  Yeah but then we'll have to to just um put five covers on it , and see if it works . If it won't works then we'll get something else . Then we uh won't g uh go further with it .
A :  Yeah but are their
A :  profits bigger than their cost ?
C :  Uh a p a a cover made in uh in China , it it won't be I guess so expensive I think .
A :  Yeah but there are also design cost .
A :  I don't think When you have a remote control , do you change the cover ?
C :  Maybe . I wi I won't . But maybe I think trendy people or like children where you can paint on it , and uh the the children think , oh this is my remote control , uh I made a picture on it . Uh
A :  Would you change the cover ?
A :  No .
A :  N yeah but
A :  I think that too less people would change it for good profit . So
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  And the other people ? What do you think about it ?
D :  Um
B :  Yeah it's a good idea . But
B :  If if it Yeah , I don't I'm not sure if it will make profit enough to uh But it's uh yeah it's uh original idea .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yes it is but I don't think we have to do it .
C :  Okay . You're the Project Manager . Yes . That's it .
B :  No .
D :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
A :  That's clear . Okay thank you . So now the User Interface Designer .
B :  Oh . That's me .
B :  Uh
B :  Come on . .
B :  Ah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yes well uh uh I shall give a short talk about the the technical function design . Um I thought the the the technical function design was uh to uh for a remote control to to to have some influence on the T_V_ set .
B :  Uh both audio and vide video uh in a cordless way . No cords attached . And uh well , it all by pushing a button on the remote . That was from my own experience and uh and uh the previous meeting .
B :  Uh I find some uh some interesting quotes on the web . Uh well the same idea here . Uh message to the television .
B :  And uh and and and well basic uh operations like on and off , and uh switching channels , and uh and maybe uh teletext or something like that .
B :  Uh well these are two uh remotes , and that's our uh our dilemma I think . Uh
B :  We just heard from the Industrial Designer how uh difficult it is . But uh shall we make a basic remote control , uh just uh swapping channels and volume and uh power button and well nothing much more .
B :  Or uh uh more functions on the remote . Uh maybe more devices you can influence . Uh a radio or a v a video recorder , uh V_C_R_ .
B :  Yeah well that's our dilemma . Um any ideas about that ?
B :  Basic or multifunctional ?
A :  We'll got back on that later .
B :  Okay yeah . Yeah well the that was just on my mind . So uh I didn't know what uh
D :  Yes .
B :  what way we would go .
B :  Mm yeah well that was my uh functional uh talk .
C :  'Kay .
A :  'Kay , thank you .
A :  Then it's your turn , the marketing expert .
D :  Okay .
D :  Uh um m
D :  Yeah .
D :  Um yeah okay . This bit too far .
D :  So
D :  So I'm uh gonna have a presentation about um the market , about um yeah what people think . Uh we did a usability lab-test with a hundred persons . And we looked at uh several um things . Uh among them design , uh d d how d did they like the use of it , uh what frustrations they had while using remote controls .
D :  Uh well what what will be our market . And uh we asked them if we had some new featu features . If um that would be a good idea or not .
D :  Well our findings . Uh our users , they disliked the look and feel of current remote controls .
D :  Um uh they especially found found them very ugly . And um th they also found them hard to to learn how to use it . Uh well they also zap a lot . So uh zapping uh should be very easy .
D :  And uh fifty percent of the users only use ten percent of the buttons . So a lot of unused buttons . There is more findings .
D :  Uh on the buttons . Which uh buttons find users uh very important and which which not ? And how much would they use them ? Well uh the most used button is the channel selection .
D :  And uh we asked them how uh relevant they think uh the buttons are . The power , volume and channel selections are very relevant . Uh teletext is uh less relevant but also important .
D :  Uh not important they found the audio , uh that's not the volume but uh specific the the pitch , or the left or right . Uh the screen and the brightness . And uh channel settings .
D :  Uh th and they also are not used very often . Then we have a few um graphs about the market . Uh here we can see what the market share is of uh several groups .
D :  Um as you can see , most users are uh between thirty six and forty five . Um the the the younger group between sixteen and twenty five is not very big . And to come back on the the swapping uh things , uh I don't think uh , I I think the younger will be most interest in it .
D :  But uh they are not a very big group . Um in the we asked them , uh how would you like a s a new feature . If you have an L_C_D_ on the remote control , what would you think of it .
D :  Now you can clearly see young users say . I will that would very nice . And older user think uh they will be scared of change I think . And they won't like it . And another thing , how would you like to have a speech recognition on it .
D :  Well here we see the same . Young users uh think that's an interesting idea . And old users not . Uh well we uh found out that there are two several markets at which we can aim . Uh the first are the younger , the age between sixteen and forty five . Uh they are highly interested in the features , as you can see uh here .
D :  And um they are more critical on their money spending .
D :  Uh the second group is the older group . Aged between forty six and sixty five . They are less interested in uh new features . But uh they spend their money more easily . Now if we look back at this graph , we can see that among the first group is about um sixty percent . And the second group about forty percent .
D :  So the the first group is bigger . Well then I come to my uh personal preferences . Uh yeah the first question is uh also we have to ask is at the which market do we aim at .
D :  Uh of course n uh saying we aim at the young group doesn't say that old people won't buy it . But less of them will buy it . Um well I uh Okay . What I thought , um even young people say it's hard to use ,
D :  remote control . So if you make a remote control that is uh very easy to use , that's especially aimed at this group , even uh the young group will also be more interested .
D :  And um we can make special features . But uh I think it looks nice in the first time . But when use it , uh I don't know what's uh good thing of speech recognition .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um well th uh that's my second point . Uh less important functions should be discarded from the remote control . It's about discussion we had earlier . Um
D :  You can find most functions on a T_V_ set .
D :  So uh you don't have to have a lot of audio options , or screen options to change the brightness .
D :  And such things . Um well the design is very important . One thing I did not say I think , is that a lot of users also said then I would uh buy a good looking uh remote control if there will be one .
D :  But they found most remote controls very ugly . So the design of our remote control is very important . And uh yeah it should be very zap friendly , as most users use it for that .
D :  That were my findings .
A :  Okay thank you . Yes .
C :  Yeah . I have uh one question . If we aim for the younger people , um and there will be uh a lot of features like L_C_D_ or the the the speech uh f recognising , uh the cost will be a lot of h uh a lot higher . Uh I think we don't have that in our budget . Do you think ? Like
D :  Yes .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  No .
D :  No .
B :  And I don't uh I don't think twenty five Euros for a remote is really cheap or something . So it's
C :  No . No .
B :  Yeah , it's hard to uh
B :  get the younger
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  group .
A :  I think uh the L_C_D_ is cheaper than speech recognition . So I think that can be an d good option . L_C_D_ .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Just the L_C_D_ ? Mm-hmm .
A :  Yes . Only the L_C_D_ .
A :  So But we'll come back on that .
D :  Okay .
A :  Now
A :  Oh , go on .
A :  What d d d um
A :  Um
A :  Uh we go back on the decisions later . Now we have a few new product requirements . First , teletext . We have internet now so we don't need the teletext anymore . So
A :  not necessary . Next .
A :  Only for the television . So we don't look at the other things like the radio or something . Only the television . Third .
A :  We look at the age group of forty plus . Uh no , younger than forty . Is a g big group , and like you showed , n not very much people buy our stuff .
A :  Fourth point .
A :  Our corporate colour and slogan must be used . Very important for the design . So you can see it on our site .
A :  Next .
A :  Um no .
A :  We have to make our decisions , what we want to do . So like
A :  you said , we need the . Maybe it's good to put it in a document .
A :  Now we have to decide what controls do we need . So maybe you can tell us .
D :  Yeah maybe we can first have a discussion uh on the the product requirements you just uh said .
A :  Sorry ?
D :  The the requirements you just said , maybe we should first have a discussion about that . I uh personally think uh teletext is a good option . Uh not everyone um who is looking T_V_ can go to internet when they want to see the latest news .
A :  Yes .
A :  Yes , it's okay .
A :  Yeah but we don't use it . It's a new requirement . So , it's not my requirement .
C :  'Kay , we'll just have to do that . Okay .
A :  We have to do this .
D :  Okay . Okay sorry . Then uh
C :  No discussion about it . Okay . Unfortunately .
A :  No .
A :  what controls do we need ?
A :  Who first ?
B :  Well a power button ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh power .
B :  Uh the well um I think separate channels . So
A :  Uh mm channel .
B :  But then both the the separate channels . So so uh zero to nine or something .
A :  Channel
A :  Zero to nine .
B :  Uh volume .
A :  Volume .
A :  Maybe it's easy to pick . What was w your one ?
D :  Mine ? It's the functional requirements .
A :  Okay .
A :  We had w uh no no no no .
A :  Where was that example of the
B :  Oh mine .
A :  Johan . That was the the the the the technical
B :  Technical .
A :  Hallo .
A :  Okay . What do we need ?
A :  On-off . Zero to nine .
C :  To change to the next channel , just one button . To move up , move down .
A :  Yeah that's the channel .
D :  D Yeah . Do we make a menu ?
A :  Menu ? Uh yes the n newer televisions ha do have menus .
A :  Uh
D :  Uh
A :  M Menu . I think um
A :  only one or
A :  two numbers .
B :  Mm yes .
A :  And
A :  Hello ?
A :  That's ch
D :  I think it will be um q quite easy to use , to have uh uh four arrows . Up-down for channel selection , and left-right uh for volume . And uh a menu uh button . And if you press the menu button you get into the menu , and you can use the same buttons . But the then to scroll through the menu and to change the options .
A :  Yes .
A :  On the L_C_D_ screen ,
A :  you mean ?
D :  Uh well yeah that depends on if you have uh the menu on the T_V_ . Or you get the menu on the L_C_D_ screen on the remote control .
A :  Think it's better to have it on the remote control , 'cause it it has to work on all televisions .
D :  Yes .
C :  But then we come to the costs .
A :  we need
A :  N Yes . But if we
A :  have this
D :  'Kay .
D :  But well if you aim at the younger market , um a as they as uh s uh as we seen in the usability uh lab , uh they will buy a nice looking um
D :  remote control .
D :  And also to find the easy to use uh part very important . So if we have a L_C_D_ sh uh screen , and uh not too many buttons , I think that will incre uh uh even when it's a bit more cost , it will still sell .
A :  So now we don't have a lot of buttons .
A :  Is this enough ?
B :  Mute .
A :  Mute .
A :  Maybe in the menu ?
B :  Um
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah but then it's always uh more than one uh
A :  Mute . Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  thing to do .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe more ?
A :  No .
A :  Well . Then that's all . This will be the buttons .
A :  And
A :  I think that's enough for the next phase . So we can go on to
C :  But now we have only the buttons . And uh we don't yet have to decide what the remote control would look like ? Or
A :  Yes .
A :  No that's for the next phase . Um
C :  Okay .
A :  Phase two is the conceptual design . So then we'll have the concepts .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  That's for the So uh next point .
A :  Now we have lunch-break .
A :  After that we have t thirty minutes for work . And you can find the minutes in the Project Documents folder inclusive the uh buttons . No .
A :  Your individual action , you can find them in the email .
A :  So now it's time for lunch .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay . Good idea .
A :  Thanks for coming .
A :  Welcome back .
B :  Hello .
D :  Hello .
A :  Uh let me see .
B :  There's one of mine .
A :  Okay . Roo , welcome back .
B :  Hello , Flores .
A :  The waiting is for Sebastian .
B :  .
A :  There he is .
C :  Is there any time for a cup of coffee ? Can I get a cup of coffee ? Okay .
B :  We have a slight problem . I opened uh the C_D_ ROM box uh guys .
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Uh no . You can't , sorry .
B :  So just cancel it .
C :  Well , during my work I have no time either . So
A :  Well , this is life . Sorry uh , Roo .
B :  Yeah , I opened the C_D_ ROM box . Accidentally . But it's alright .
A :  Okay . Okay . People , welcome back with the second meeting .
A :  Um for now on the schedule are a few points . Uh first of all the opening , which we are doing now . Um second , I received um some new project requirements . I'm not sure if you received them as well , um but I will tell you about it . Um then um the three of you uh prepared a presentation , I think ? Sebastian ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I think so too .
A :  Roo ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Ruud ? Almost , okay . Then we'll do your one uh uh as la uh the last . Um the top goal of this m
D :  Almost .
B :  But you can't upload your presentation from here , I believe .
A :  Um we will figure that out . Ca can you try to
B :  Okay .
D :  Uh if it if it if it's wireless I could just uh put it in the .
A :  Yeah , w we will see .
B :  I don't think it's wireless here . Or it is . Yeah ? Okay , great .
A :  Um it is , yeah .
C :  It is . It is .
D :  Uh okay .
A :  Yeah . Um the top goal of this meeting is to reach a decision on the product , on the target group um and and the functions of the remote control , so keep that in mind . Um
A :  we have forty minutes . So
A :  it's now
A :  Yep . Okay . Um the new project requirements , first of all , um we didn't speak about it , but we should not um support teletext in the remote , um because our b um board uh feels that uh teletext is out of date and internet is replacing teletext . So um we are not even going to try to um implement it in our product .
A :  It's a board decision . Um the remote control should only be used for television , because it's not uh f uh feasible , it's not uh w uh uh we we cannot make it because of the time to market um that we have to deal with . Uh the third requirement is that we should focus on customers that are younger than uh forty , which is important for you , uh Ruud , and as well for uh Roo . Because the product should um be uh interesting and and uh should be bought by people younger than forty . Um
B :  Yeah .
B :  Time , yeah .
A :  then for Roo , as well uh important , the corporate image should be recognisable in our product . So the colour colours and the slogan um do have to be uh in the product .
B :  Yes .
A :  Is that clear ?
A :  Any questions on these
A :  requirements ?
A :  No ?
A :  Okay . Um the individual presentations , I th um Roo or Sebastian , who of you would like to start ?
B :  Yeah , I'll start .
A :  Uh uh yeah . Okay , great .
C :  Yes .
B :  Um
B :  Oh , how can I uh
B :  Geez , and sli and show .
B :  Um
B :  Just uh press it . Uh yes .
B :  Alright .
B :  Um well w we uh we had discussed this already in the fin in the previous uh discussion . Uh the method of the remote control is just the function of remote control is basically to send messages to the television set .
B :  So that was
B :  the main uh important thing what a remote control should do . Then I found uh two different kind of remote controls , the multi-function uh remote control with many possibilities , but um the lack of the feeling I already mentioned uh in the previous uh discussion . And the ease-of-use remote control with uh the less p possibilities but a great feeling in in touching the buttons .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um but um yeah .
B :  My personal preferences were ease of uh the easy to use remote control , because uh the user-friendliness and uh it can be more trendy in in user design . But um your new goal f was for uh people than less than forty years old . So maybe um the multi-function can be implemented in uh in our design . But it should b I think it should be a combination , but teletext buttons are not uh in our design . So it should uh
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  take out , well , eight buttons or so . But my in my opinion , the the easy to use R_C_ is uh the best uh possi possibility for us .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh Ruud , did you get that ?
D :  Yeah , uh b uh most .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so the important thing here is
B :  And it's also i indeed uh uh Ruud's uh insight in the in the topic . Yeah , what what does the market want ? I I don't know .
D :  Oh , user-friendly .
A :  In the market , yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay , w we will s we all uh
B :  Just for uh for user desi uh user uh friendliness I uh should choose for the the ease of use remote control .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Sebastian .
C :  Okay .
C :  Excuse me .
B :  Scusi .
C :  Um
C :  Okay , it's still the right thing .
C :  Okay . Um well , there are some changes in the design requirements , so there are some changes in the method also . Um basically all this device has to do is send messages to a T_V_ set . And the m most easy way to do this is by uh sending pulses of infrared light to a T_V_ set . Well , I th I tried to uh implement a picture here , but it's hardly readable .
B :  Energies and uh
C :  Can you see it ? No ? Well
A :  No , it's not visible .
C :  Um , there's a energy source here . And um basically there it's connected to three things . The user interface connected to a chip , which is connected to the sender , which generates messages using uh infrared light , which are sent to the receiver . That's basically the idea . And there's a little picture , just for your imagination , how a device like this should look or can look . Okay . Um what have I found . Usually these kind of things consist of a battery , infrared diode , buttons , chips , and circuit board . That's all . It's cased together , nothing more than that . It's almost every piece of equipment um
C :  every piece of uh every T_V_ set is controlled infrared . There are some exceptions , but most of all have uh infrared controls . And uh the more luxury uh remote controls have lithium buttons . And I think that's what we w yes . In the and it's a little more a little bit more fancy also . So maybe we should consider that . Okay . I have a basic scheme of the things uh which are implemented . Um basically this is all there is . There's just one chip . There are a few buttons connected . Uh the buttons are lit . And the whole thing is transmitted by a infrared li diode , and there is not a power source here .
B :  Yeah .
B :  The glow in the dark uh concept uh we discussed .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  So that's basically the total design of this piece of equipment . There's nothing more to it . It's fairly easy . It's been done many times before , and I think we should uh we should c s succeed in in our plan to do this . So
A :  So it's fairly easy .
B :  Succeed in it also .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , good .
C :  Okay , so uh personally I think we should infra use infrared , because uh otherwise our device cannot uh communicate with uh almost every T_V_ set . So I think that uh should be clear . Uh another important point is uh we really should use uh energy uh sparse , friendly components . Uh there are specially uh designed um energy-friendly components which consume uh far less power than uh conventional components . And um if we want to use uh a rechargeable design or uh a energy-save design , we should really implement them .
A :  Okay .
C :  Um for cost-effectiveness , we should really use a very low-cost uh circuit board , um because most of the production cost are are in this uh part of the equipment . And um the money we save on using this we can use uh for elaborate fancy lighting uh techniques , blinking LEDs and all that kind of fancy stuff . I think our uh users will really uh will really like that .
A :  Okay .
B :  And what's the um if we use the LEDs , i does it use much more energy or
C :  No , they're p f uh power friendly LEDs also . So we can use them . So that's no problem .
B :  Okay .
B :  For the same costs , it's can be uh in our
C :  Uh no , they're uh they're a little bit more expensive , but by uh um um making
B :  Combined with the low-cost circuit board so it's uh
C :  We can we can make its I think .
D :  Well you could only lit uh the buttons the buttons that are used most . So , the channel switching .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , but but the question is whether um two or four buttons makes uh m makes such a difference in the costs if you already plan to uh include fancy lightning techniques , I guess .
D :  Or
C :  Okay .
B :  But I think
C :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm , true .
B :  Yeah , I think it's the same as in the cell phone , just light in in the device that that shines on all the buttons , and not for
C :  Yes . Well , it's not one light , it there are more lights in a in a in a mobile device . No no no , no . That's right , that's right . So well , this uh should be it .
B :  Yeah , but not for each button one LED , I think .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  Um have a think about it .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , Ruud .
D :  Oh , mine is already outdated .
A :  Okay well , we ar we are very curio curious to what the market um will feel about such a product .
D :  Since uh
A :  So any income is welcome . Input .
D :  Okay , make
D :  Well
D :  Uh then I'm sure the target market is uh ten million units .
D :  Of of which we should sell about uh forty percent to make the five million .
B :  Could you step a little bit more to the right ? Yeah , thank you .
A :  Okay .
D :  But um since uh the other part is uh forty percent of the market , I uh thought earlier we might want to constrain that portion of the market . But uh since uh the requirements changed , that's uh not a good idea .
D :  Uh well , skip this .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Well , it's this till true , of course . That they only use ten percent the buttons . The buttons to zap are used the about uh fifteen hundred times , when uh the power button is only used one time . And the volume button's only four times . So they're obv obviously uh the most important buttons . And uh lots of people complained they kin can't find their remote control . So we might want to build in a feature to uh support them .
C :  Mm .
D :  Some uh audio signal . Like uh home phones . Or
A :  Okay .
C :  Or a find a finding function , you know . That's quite a yes .
A :  Well , that's interesting .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's definitely interesting . It uh it separates our product from others uh as well . Okay , go on .
B :  Sound signal .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
D :  Well , I just said that . And uh well , this obvious , and he also said it .
A :  Okay . So that's what the market tells us .
D :  Uh that's about it , yes .
A :  Yep . Okay .
B :  The volume and uh the zap buttons are the mostly used . So
D :  Uh mo uh zap buttons most . Volume , they are uh use a lot . But
B :  Yeah , well it should just have a design
D :  more than all the other buttons . So
B :  The perfect design for those only those buttons . And first um
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes , we should focus on that , I guess . Well , the technical uh there I think there are no technical difficulties . There's no um elaborate technique uh used in this uh kind of equipment . So um I don't think we have any hiccups there . So we can fully concentrate on developing a product that is really um what the market needs . So maybe it's a good idea to think about these buttons and and uh and a sound signal .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
B :  Yeah , the sound signal . Just one thing I'm just wondering , the sound signal , from where do you execute th the s sound ? Another device is not a solution . It should be uh uh
D :  Yeah , that's uh a problem . Yeah .
C :  Yes . Th that's a bit of that's a problem . Usually
A :  Well maybe maybe like clapping in your hands , like um turning on and off the the the lights .
C :  Oh yes .
B :  Yeah , but maybe you'll uh get some new technologies for it .
C :  Yes . Well , there there are some devices who uh incorporate this technique already . Um there are video sets and um they have a special button , the find the remote control button . You press it and your T_V_ set starts to make a uh kind of weird sound , and your uh remote controls then start to beep . And um
A :  Reports rep respend response to it .
B :  Yeah , just like uh the phones the
C :  Yes . Yes , that's it .
C :  Yes , same thing .
D :  Yeah .
A :  But uh th
B :  But but T_V_s don't have all uh
C :  No , so we we should use something else .
B :  uh buttons . Uh
D :  And you
D :  Yeah , and usually
A :  Yeah , because we do not have a a a a a home um
B :  But I believe you will have an
C :  We do not control the T_V_ set so well .
D :  And even if the T_V_ set would have such a button , uh you would have to walk to your T_V_ , and it's
C :  Yes , m yes . S and we b we want to make so it's is easy as possible for our customers , so we should think about
A :  Okay . So what about the clapping technique ? Um because you se
B :  I'm convinced uh Sebastian will uh find uh one solution for us .
C :  It's quite complicated . Well , it's quite complicated . Because how can you separate the clapping sound from other sounds .
A :  Well , you see it a lot in in light uh lightning uh uh
D :  And b
C :  Yes , yes . Well , basically the characteristics uh the characteristics of clapping is just an increase in the volume , the amplitude of the sound , which is uh generated a few times within a uh certain period of time . But there are many other sounds uh which are exactly the same from the point of view from a remote control .
A :  Yeah , a peak . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So if if you'd be watching a movie , it would constantly beep .
A :  Yeah , that's true .
C :  Yes , so we don't want that .
B :  But we can have just uh uh a home stat uh f a base station next to the T_V_ . Just a little antenna or uh something . Well if you lost th I don't think people would bother walking to the T_V_ and press that button because they lost the their remote . Uh that's just uh
C :  Maybe we can
C :  Something like that . Well , is there not something f something more easily
A :  Well uh
C :  Well , I don't think uh .
C :  No , and y the the most important thing for people is that there's a central point to which they can go and uh b uh perform a a some kind of uh . And then uh the remote control uh reports itself , so w we should use have uh we should use something like that . You do not want another device , which can be uh everywhere in the house , which you have to find first before you can find your remote control .
A :  Yeah .
B :  just a base station next to the T_V_ is the best possibility .
C :  Yes , something like that . But that will be very costly , I think . So that's not a good idea .
A :  Yeah , m maybe um w we uh we do agree on on the thing that the remote should have such a function , if it's possible within the costs and all that kind of things . Um maybe Sebastian should have uh a detailed look later on and um come up with a solution , because that's his his field of expertise .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I will .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes . But um before I do that I w I want to warn you that uh by implementing this kind of a function the technical design will become more complicated um and it will become more costly also . Because there will be additional components which which uh will be used . And there are some implepe imp
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
B :  And do we even uh prefer the sound above the the LEDs , the lightning uh
C :  Well , I I think so , because um when you have a p newspaper over your remote control , you cannot see it . So
B :  function ?
B :  It's a unique item uh
A :  Yeah , it's a distinction in the market . It's a different exactly . It's an uni an unique feature , and um I think um it's worth um uh looking and and probably more i interesting than uh than the lights .
B :  It will be an a unique feature of our remote control .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  And just about uh the user interface , I came up with um an easy remote control and an advanced remote control . What should we choose in in design ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well , um according to Ruud , um people do not use um all the extra features very very often . So
B :  Well , the extra functions .
D :  I have the numbers r I have the numbers right here .
A :  Okay .
D :  Well , t uh we won't support teletext which which was the third-most the second-most used function .
B :  Used option .
A :  Okay . Well , we we do have a wise board , so I'm not questioning that .
C :  Okay .
D :  Uh well yeah , channel selection is obviously the most important .
A :  Yeah . Okay , so on the relevance scale uh the channel selection , the volume selection and the teletext . Well , we skip that .
D :  So
D :  Yeah . Yeah . So
B :  Well , so it just th the basic functions . And we don't have to use it for D_V_D_ players uh and all kind of stuff . So
A :  Okay .
C :  No , no . So that's out of the question . So
A :  No .
D :  Nope .
B :  Yeah . Just through uh the easy uh design . We can make uh a nice design when when there's not mu uh much buttons in it . So
A :  Yeah .
A :  Uh uh uh I think we should go for the easier one .
C :  I think also . Yes . Well , we should save costs uh by not implementing a lot of functions and uh the money that we can save from that we should use for uh having a nice design and uh thinking about the user interface and
A :  No .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , Ruud , how do you feel about that ? Uh do you agree , do you think the market would would respond to uh a simple
D :  Uh well if we um include other uh innovative
D :  functions uh then they uh might , 'cause young people uh like new features . So
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's right .
A :  Okay , so this is is kind of uh
C :  Mm .
B :  Uh just a few buttons , trendy design , nice lightning effects wh and the sound .
C :  Okay . Well , is it maybe there's another possibility . You can make it look like an easy s piece of equipment , but it's quite elaborated , uh because it has many functions . Maybe it's more important to make the make it look like a very uh friendly , easy to catch piece of equipment , but um nevertheless
A :  Yeah .
A :  But but are we not in in the in the manual uh I mean if you have few buttons , no display , um I mean uh I guess it's l it's working with with a shift functions and um one button can uh
C :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
C :  Ok like that . Well , I was more thinking about a more elaborate way of controlling , by by these kinds of sticks or something like that . I don't know if if it's user-friendly . That's your field of expertise .
B :  Yeah , I don't know yet .
A :  But but how does how does the remote uh report uh r uh give back to the user w in what state it is ? Because we do not implement uh a user history .
C :  Mm-hmm . There's no , but there's no way to do that , because we cannot implement that kind of the system . W
A :  I know , but but if we use uh like a stick , for example , um
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well , maybe we can use a light for that . When you move the stick to a to a position , maybe uh a light next to it can lit up . So you know I've just uh pushed the button , or I changed the channel or t uh turned up the volume . Something like that .
D :  And if you use that stick for volume control and channel uh selection , you have the m two most important functions in one uh button .
A :  Yeah . Uh and we could have other buttons for the for the advanced uh functions .
C :  Yes .
B :  But does it uh I then should n just use uh i instead of the stick , uh like many cell phones , just a round m well , should we just use a
A :  Yeah , draw draw it on the board .
B :  Um it's already uh oh , we have a blank .
B :  Oh .
C :  Oh yeah , something like that .
C :  It's not really a stick , but
B :  It's just an easy uh way of of a round button what which can be pushed in four directions . Instead of a stick . A stick is v vulnerab vulnerable
C :  Yes . Yes .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah , it can break down .
B :  when it's falling down or uh just a round uh button should be the trick , I think .
C :  Yes , yes .
D :  Yeah .
C :  And
C :  Yes , and this also looks more fancy , I think . I think it it will attract uh
B :  Yeah .
C :  more uh uh public , I think . But you're the marketing man .
D :  A younger uh Huh .
D :  And it's also quite easy to use , so it'll it uh attract younger people because well new , and it might attract older people because it's easy to use .
B :  Geez .
B :  Well , volume and
B :  something uh
B :  like that .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  The programme up and down .
A :  Okay , yeah .
B :  And the vol yeah , the pen doesn't uh really does what I want .
C :  Okay , that's good .
A :  Okay , but w we still we're still in the question of uh um uh putting in advanced options . Um Ruud just told us um the market is interested in some advanced uh new techniques . Um however , uh keeping it simple is is important for the costs and all all those kind of things . We need to find a balance between uh the advanced techniques and and the user-friendliness .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But I think our our next step to look at is just that . So I don't think it's um we have something to do . Uh we can't discuss it right now , because n no one of us have has the information to discuss about that ,
A :  Um well , for we do have to uh decide this this meeting . Yeah . We need to um have the uh the user function uh the functions decided and um
B :  I think .
B :  Yes ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
A :  uh our target audience .
C :  Okay .
B :  'Kay , but teletext is so uh is just scrapped .
C :  Do do you want a list of functions ? Do you want an explicit list ? Uh which uh incorporates all function available on the device ?
A :  Um well , I do not want a full uh it's not necessary to to have a full list , but I want um the kind of functions , for example uh th the most important are volume and uh programme selecting .
C :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  The ten digits .
A :  Well , for example , that that's what we should think about . l how is the remote going to look ? Not not in the user interface , but
B :  Oh , and just one function . The the the the programme to programme button , the switch to uh two channels , when you have uh something on channel four and something on channel six , just one button which which can uh change yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm . Yes .
A :  Yeah .
A :  A bit of a split mode . Uh l like Yeah . Dual channel watch . Okay , well um m maybe I should write that down . Uh Ruud , um what's your last name ?
C :  Change . Yes , yes .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well you're the secretary .
D :  Mielsen .
A :  Mielsen , because I I was writing it down in the last uh Mielsen . Right . Um I put all the minutes I make into the shared folder . So if you want to have a look at it , you know where to find it . Um
C :  Mm okay , but make a s make a sub-folder for it , because it's starting to fill up already .
B :  Alright .
A :  Yeah , that's that's if you want to do it , Sebastian .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Sure .
B :  Our B_S_C_ uh W_ uh
C :  .
B : 
A :  Okay , um
A :  Okay , so so um uh
A :  Volume . Programme .
A :  Uh dual channel . Uh
C :  Yes , that's important .
A :  And and do we want um
A :  the ten digits ?
B :  The ten digits ? Yeah , I believe so .
C :  Well , are are you sure ? I'm not so sure .
D :  Well , if you want to go to channel ninety and you have th that button .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well , that's complicated , but is that so relevant ? Because I don't think but you should uh shou you should know that .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I wouldn't buy it personally .
C :  If it were so .
B :  A remote control without the ten digits . Uh and I think the most
C :  Okay , I can imagine when
A :  I agree actually .
C :  I can imagine when you're when you have a satellite decoder and and you have , well , about six hundred channels , I can imagine you want this . But if you're uh a regular T_V_ user , and you just want uh to watch the the Dutch television networks , well , you can uh you can use uh about ten buttons . That's enough .
B :  Just elder elder people would would buy it , but
D :  Well
A :  But we do have thirteen different Dutch channels .
D :  But
B :  Yep .
C :  Well , but how how often do you watch all these channels ?
D :  Yeah , and if if we
B :  The older people only use five of them .
D :  And if we are targeting at the younger audience , they will probably watch more channels than the older people . So
A :  Often .
C :  No , you're probably right .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . But I think these uh ten uh buttons look a bit dull . Don't you think ?
A :  Well , it depends on the on the on the looks , on the on the
C :  The design . Okay . Well , y then there should be should done be done something specific with it .
B :  On the design .
D :  Well
A :  You c you can d make them very fancy by um
D :  And
A :  I mean Nokia , they have ten digits on their phones and it still looks very fancy . So I'm I'm I do not agree
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh
C :  Okay , so you can experiment by uh with with shape or with size or with colour , that kind of thing . Okay .
A :  Exactly , exactly .
D :  And um there are some numbers about uh speech recognition here that uh younger people would like it . Uh it might be expensive and uh hard to implement , but it would be a solution uh
A :  Okay , speech .
D :  for
C :  Well , maybe it can be combined with the find the remote control . So um when you add uh speech recognition to your remote control , uh it's very easy to change uh the channel . That's one thing . And it's very easy uh to find your remote control .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  To find yeah .
C :  So maybe that's a possibility , but I'm afraid it will be a bit costly . But maybe when we uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh
A :  If if we would um drop the ten digits but keep the programme and the volume , because maybe people do not always want to use their voice , um
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay , okay .
D :  Especially elder people uh don't like voice recognition . So then we should implement such a but
A :  Yeah . But we do focus on younger people . We d it it's a board uh decision .
D :  Yes .
C :  Okay . Well . I I think it should uh should work , it sh we should manage that .
B :  So we have to i to make um a decision between the ten digits or the voice recognition .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yes . Well , the voice recognition has the main adva has another advantage . It's mas it makes it very easy for us to implement the find uh find the remote control button uh remote control function .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So that's that's a big advantage , I think .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , g good .
A :  Okay .
C :  There's only one disadvantage uh by implementing this . Um the power saving power saving will be a bit more difficult . So we can expect that there will be a less longer life to the batteries . But maybe can we we can think something smart about it . There are some uh hybrid hybrid devices which incorporate a solar panel and rechargeable batteries . So when you just leave the device in a in a light room , it charges itself . You have to do nothing for it .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay . But
A :  But but can we manage it bu uh for the costs ?
B :  Twelve dollar fifty .
C :  Maybe , maybe not . I'll have to find that out .
A :  Because it seems like a very
D :  And uh if we if we could inc uh include a c a cradle in which it could recharge ,
C :  Yes . So
D :  then there wouldn't be uh a big problem . 'Cause when
C :  No , that's very cheap .
A :  Is a cradle very cheap ?
C :  It's Oh , it's very cheap . That's no problem . It's just a a case with two uh metal contacts .
A :  I know , b uh but there should be an adapter as well .
C :  It's
C :  Yes , but they're they're mass production . They're very cheap . So it will cost us p practically nothing .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . We we have uh about ten minutes left this meeting . Um
A :  I would like to hear um maybe maybe you all have th uh things not um spoken about , yeah , but that are important . Uh Ruud , you you came up with the voice recognition uh data . Uh are there other things about the market we should know ?
D :  Um I think we dealt with the most important information . Just that the younger part of uh the market isn't the forty percent we uh
D :  want to sell to .
D :  So we we should uh for least a bit uh look at the uh older people . But with uh buttons like that , which are easy to use , we uh might attract them too . So
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  I don't think that's a big problem
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so although we are focussing on younger people uh to make it uh profitable uh
D :  Yes . Yeah , profitable .
C :  Profitable .
A :  Profitable . We we yeah , we still need to take in account the the bit older people . Okay . O okay .
D :  Yes .
A :  Um Roo .
B :  I have nothing uh nothing to add , I think .
A : 
A :  Nothing to add .
A :  Sebastian ?
C :  Um I just want to make a summary of all all things uh spoken and uh the different possibilities . Um
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Great .
C :  so uh basically we've decided to implement a seemingly uh easy design . So on the outside it looks easy , but uh we can make it easy on the inside or elaborate on the inside . So that's one the those are the choices we have to make . But I think there's a big advantage in making it more elaborate by uh implementing uh speech techniques , uh voice recognition , that these kinds of things .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Um it makes it also more uh attractable , I think , to our uh audience . Um there are some advantages and some disadvantages , and the main advantage is that we can implement uh fancy techniques , which uh I think our customers will like . The disadvantage is that there are some concerns about uh the the costs and um the things like uh battery lifetime , energy saving . Uh another advantage is that the circuit board will become much more easier if we do not do not implement these buttons .
A :  Yep .
C :  If we just add uh uh a chip which does the voice recognition , uh our circuit board will become even more cheap . So that's another well , it wa it w it was an issue , but we also thought that we already thought we should do it as cheaply as possible . And this even uh makes it more cheapy . So
A :  Yeah , and that was the main issue , right ? The the board
A :  Yeah .
B :  But the cheaper the ch uh the the chip or th what was it ? The circuit board .
C :  Mm-hmm . The circuit board .
A :  The board .
B :  The fewer buttons you can use on it .
C :  The fewer buttons you have , the ch ch the cheaper the circuit board , yes .
A :  No , it's th yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
A :  It's the other way around , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And it's very cheap uh to incorporate uh uh an integrated circuit , a chip . So that's
C :  that's another advantage .
A :  It shouldn't be a big issue .
B :  Well it then we should just uh take a look at the costs and uh especially for the voice recognition .
C :  So
C :  Yes , because I don't know
C :  Yes . I d I really don't know . So
B :  No .
C :  It can be costly . Maybe not .
A :  Okay . I'm not sure how how we'll f uh determine the costs , I will have a look at it . Maybe you will get some information on that . Um I'm not sure how how that
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes , I al I I hope my personal coach will uh have a lo uh look at it .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay , great . Um
A :  well , I think we're qui quite done . Um for now we will have the lunch break .
B :  We're done , I think .
C :  How nice .
A :  Um I'm don't know how long the break will be , but we'll find out . Um then we will have thirty minutes of time to perform our individual work , uh and I'm sure your personal coaches will uh assist you with it . Um I will put the minutes I just made in the project documents folder . If you want to look at it um well , just do . Um the Interface Designer , um I would like to the next meeting I would like to receive the uh components concept . Uh Roo , um from you I would like to see
B :  Me neither .
B :  Interface industrial .
A :  Uh
A :  I'm sorry , yeah , I'm sorry . User Interface Designer , uh Roo , I would like to see the user interface c uh concept . And um
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well , we understand .
B :  Uh the only problem is it that it depends on the divisions the decis uh decisions Sebastian makes . About the voice recognition . Well
C :  Well
A :  Well , i it should be easy , that's w w what we concluded . It should be an easy interface with not so much buttons . S just a a p a p a volume and a programme one . And um
C :  Mm yes .
B :  Yeah .
A :  um yeah , some some fancy lights . I think that's what we decided .
C :  So we drop the voice recognition ? Or Oh .
A :  No no no , we didn't but it shouldn't be integrated yeah , it's of course it's user interface , but um i I was talking about really the design of the
C :  Okay . Well um do we really have to decide now or can we decide next meeting ?
A :  No .
A :  We can decide the next meeting . Yep .
C :  Okay .
C :  Because I'll have some updated info on that uh
A :  Yeah . I guess all of you have i updated info . I'm sure the marketing expert will receive uh t uh you will do some trend watching . And I'm sure the market will um uh
B :  Yep .
D :  Hmm .
A :  uh will change , adapt and um so we will see that . Um yeah , that's it for now .
B :  Adapt .
C :  Adapt .
D :  Left .
D :  Hmm .
B :  That's it .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Any other questions or can we have the lunch ?
C :  We can have the lunch .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay . Good .
B :  I'll take the lunch .
A :  Wait for the marketing director actually , so .
A :  Anyways .
A :  Uh .
A :  See , shall we wait ? I'm not sure if he's late or delayed or whatever , so I'm gonna start soon , we have now don't have much time anyway . There you are , okay .
B :  Oh , there he is .
D :  Yes . Sorry , a little bit of pl little problem with computer .
C :  Okay , we
A :  Uh no problem . We're about to start , so have a seat .
A :  Okay , welcome again . Today , functional design phase .
D :  .
A :  I'll take you over the minutes of last last meeting . Okay , that was just to get to know each other , have a little thoughts on what your vision is and on this project , so
D :  Uh .
A :  I put the minutes on the I made on the on the p the the project share , so if you wanna review them , they're there . I will do so after every meeting , so if you have some information you wanna take back you can find it there . Anyways , um today three presentations , from every one of you .
A :  Um after that I got some new project requirements from project board , so we're gonna go af go after over this later . But I wanna start with uh stuff you did first , so we can see what everybody came up with . And after that we can have the new requirements and share some thoughts , so . Who would like wanna go first ?
D :  Yeah , sure , no problem . Um there was a little problem with my computer so not uh the whole uh presentation uh
B :  Go ahead .
A :  Take it .
A :  Anyway , let's see what you have .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Um
D :  Okay , and
A :  Uh it's still a bit open .
D :  I want to open the my s oh no .
A :  You should close it on your own notebook , I guess . Yeah . So there ? Okay .
D :  Oh no , that's okay .
D :  Uh slide show .
D :  Yes . The functional requirements , it's uh uh very important for uh the user , he he wants to yeah . The the method we used uh it it's not m not a slide , because it went wrong , but the method we use uh , um we tested it w uh with uh a hundred uh men , and we asked them to w uh what the remote uh f feel uh like and uh what what's uh important . Uh
A :  If I can cut in , is it people or men ? Is it people , okay . 'Cause I thought it was only men , so 'Kay .
D :  People , sorry . Both women and men , yeah . Okay . Uh the findings um uh seventy five percent of the users find most remote controls ugly . Um
B :  That's pretty shocking uh .
A :  So we have to s we have to do something about that .
D :  Yeah , and yeah , most th th they want to spend money for a better system , for better remote control , so we can do uh a l a little uh nice things with it , and um they use yeah , they use zap a lot , um uh fifty percent say they only
D :  So that's the most important things . Um oh yeah , not all of it is it on mine
A :  Okay .
D :  on my PowerPoint presentation , but um uh the relevant buttons are the power , the channel selection and the volume selection . It's uh the most basic buttons that a user wants uh to use . Uh less important is tel teletext ,
A :  Okay , just talk ahead .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  uh um they use it , but it's not uh very uh important uh on the scale of zero to ten they six and a half uh and but not important is the channel selection , the the hmm ? Oh , the the no no no no no , that's very important , but uh w and not important in the audio settings , display settings and uh
A :  Okay , that's okay .
A :  That's a little weird .
B :  Which channel selection ?
A :  Okay , we can we can hide those under a menu or something , okay .
B :  Oh , okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Um new preferences preferences . Uh um um beep to find your control , was that was in the test , the the most people uh f find it uh irritating uh when they cannot find a rem their remote control , so uh I think it's a bee beep to sound it and uh you can find it . And another thing uh they want was uh speech recognition um so they can say uh what they want to let's go to channel one and uh that's uh kind of things . And they want maybe an uh L_C_D_ screen um to to look it um wh what's on every channel uh and uh what do I want with it ?
A :  That's like a button on your T_V_ ?
C :  Mm .
A :  Remote , okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  We wanna have a little preview on the remote control . Preview what's on the channel . Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Is that manageable ? 'Cause it sounds pretty expensive too .
A :  That sounds too It's possible , but uh I think it's expensive , but do continue .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . Um
D :  Uh my personal preferences is uh a button for my favourite channel , so I can uh I dunno , so I can zap to my uh
D :  f uh quick uh to my favourite channel wh what I uh so , the remote mu must see or um
D :  must um see wha what mine preferences are for which channel , so I can zap t to
A :  Okay , you don't set it yourself , it just remembers the channel that you are on most , for example . You want the you want it to be programmed , for example y programmed f or you want it to recognise your favourite channel ? Let's see , you you spend twenty minutes each day on that channel , so it recognises your favourite channel .
D :  What ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Recognise
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's uh what my personal preference like .
A :  Okay , so it's it it does it recognise itself , you don't have to set it Okay .
D :  No , itself . Maybe it's easier to to sell it , but
A :  Okay .
D :  I don't know it's manageable , but we will uh we will see . Yeah , it's a little bit uh it's the end of it . It's a little bit uh I lost it , the computer uh crashed , so .
A :  I see .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  No problem , it's it's okay , that's Yeah , go ahead .
B :  Shall I go ? Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So , some technical functions .
D :  Darn computer .
B :  Basically I have some issues which you discussed earlier . Uh let's just start with the method . It sounds really easy , what does the user do , what does the th remote control do , but there are quite some issues .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So the things I'm going to concentrate on are the user aspect , because the technical aspect , that's pretty much covered . We can do that . What goes wrong
B :  at the user . Gets the remote control . Where is the remote control ? We've all had it once , I want to watch some television , where's the remote control ? That was one of your ideas which you posted in the network folder , a really good idea . Uh these are just the issues . I come to some uh personal experience , findings , possible solutions later . Searches for the button .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That seems very good .
B :  There are many buttons on a remote control which are not clear . Uh so either we lose those or we try to make it a little bit more clear . Uh also symbols tend to fade after a while .
D :  Mm uh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  There's nothing more annoying than faded symbols , because you don't know which channel is this button , so possibly we could find uh something for that , yes . Uh covered that . Oh yes , user presses the button . Um usually when you have a lot of buttons , buttons are small . So you press more once remote control goes
A :  Okay , so have it more make it more durable actually . Okay .
A :  Okay , so the buttons should be
B :  kablouey or something like that , so we have to pay attention not to put too mun too many buttons on uh the remote control . And possibly also the size , so more important buttons , bigger si
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
A :  Wow . The s Yeah . Make it make them bigger . Even more durable uh .
B :  So this is basically what I h had in mind in the fade-proof symbols , locator , a sound , uh so clear we should stick to existing symbols , but maybe we could do a little uh investigation to see whether some symbols are uh need to be replaced by others . Uh
A :  Okay .
B :  This I pretty much covered . So what we want to go to is not this one , but more less buttons , easy , some bigger buttons .
A :  Yeah , it's true .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So that's basically uh what I had in mind .
A :  Yeah , that's clear .
B :  This is not the final design , this is just a general idea of how I'd like to see uh basically the general idea .
A :  No , of course uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  I must say that it
B :  So that was it .
A :  Hmm .
A :  That was it . Okay , that was good . So we agree on the the part that we need to get something on the on the remote to find it somewhere and increase it the durability of of the thing , so The other aspects , we'll just see how what you came up with and what's possible for that budget .
B :  Yeah , I think it's a really good idea .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Okay , that's fine . Um . Okay , now work a little with me .
C :  Okay . Well , let's start it as it is . Okay , uh the method . There are a few questions that need to be answered , uh you already uh talked about it a little bit . Which buttons are wanted , uh is our remote control universal or should it be programmable . Uh if it should be programmeab grammeale then we need um something like a mode that you can switch it . Because then the buttons have to send out a different signal then they would normally do . And uh how big is the remote control uh going to be ? I'll tell you why that's important to me . Um there are a lot of technical parts in the remote control , so uh uh that's why I also would like to say uh go a little bit easy on the designs , uh I heard ab uh you talking about beeps and about uh video screens , but uh the material inside and the technical aspects are quite complex already .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So keep in mind that everything that you keep uh think of , it has to b to be built . So it's that's not as easy as it s might look like . Uh material study , I'm working on that um for the the costs . I have to check out how far I can go with that . Normally , a circuit board is made of fibreglass uh and the wires are made of copper . Uh that is how it is done and all the remote controls work that way , I think we can just go on with that . Um then I've read more integration of materials means less cost for the production . The more we can make uh at once uh in one piece , uh that is cheaper .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Of course , hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  You mean integrate them all into the circuit board . Okay .
C :  Exactly , so if we make a circuit board with the the connections already on it , then that's cheaper . So we have to make something that's not too difficult in design again . This is what look like uh looks like if you press one button , so this is not the entire thing . You have the the power coming in , then you have like a switch . The switch uh uh uh if you p press it then some electrical charge goes into the processor , that thinks over a Morse code , that's how you should see it . The Morse code goes to the amplifier , then uh the signal is sent to two uh light bulbs . You have infrared and an interv um uh how to say it ? Uh a light in indication , light that you know that it's functioning .
A :  Yeah , okay . So you have
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh here again , that's my story about the different modes , if you do want to make remote uh universal , then the processor has to uh make up a different Morse code when some button is pressed . That makes it much more complex , so we really need to have a look , do we want that or not . Uh I don't have any personal p uh preferences uh so far , except for uh the materials to be used uh light , that they are light .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . That was it ? I'll get back to my thing then .
C :  That was it .
A :  Uh
A :  Okay , back this up to the screen . So I got some new information on the project specifications are changing a little . Like you said uh teletext is not not very popular anymore because the uh the internet , nowadays people don't use the teletext anymore or hardly , so it can either
A :  Well , I don't think we should remove the button , because there are always people who are using it . But I don't think it should be very it should be one of the big buttons for example . Just put it somewhere or under second option or whatever . It's not important anymore . Um we're targeting young people now , because our um
B :  Yeah .
A :  This is a new product and with this new product we want to appeal to younger people , which are um the younger people were defined under forty . I so I think it's that's also good with the fashion and everything , so yeah .
D :  Uh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , and they want to pay for it and uh
A :  They want to pay for it , people are willing to spend money actually to buy a um remote that they like . If they like the way it looks , the way it functions , so they're actually gonna spend uh spend money on it .
D :  With more
D :  Where with more technical specifications
A :  Yeah . see how far we can go with it anyway , so And one thing that should be important is that the corporate l colour and slogan are recognisable , which is apparently black and yellow , but
D :  in the
D :  Yeah .
A :  I'm not sure if we I think we should keep the the logo in mind , because with colours you can uh have a lot of uh fashionable colours and everything on it , which suits everybody's taste . So
A :  With that concept I started thinking , so why not just steal Nokia's idea and just make changeable covers for your I mean those cost hardly anything I think , and people could even spend extra money
B :  Oh .
C :  Yeah .
A :  on buying a cover and so have an entire new remote control that they like to see . Or we can sh for example we can make a different a basic design .
A :  And sell the covers separately , for example . That's just a little marketing idea that could be applied , so you can p it appeals to really everyone . So you don't have to I think you don't have to make entire remote controls . We make a basic one and manufacture this cover separately . So that was that was my idea on what we could do to appeal this product to everyone . So just
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  I'm not sure if you came up with anything in the meantime , after making a presentation . Would you like to share ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  No , I think this is a good idea . But
A :  Okay .
D :  But oh ?
B :  Is it manageable ? Is it easy ?
C :  Go ahead .
D :  Yeah , with with an L_C_D_ screen you can
A :  Oh yeah . I think we should lose the L_C_D_ screen , like you said . I think for example it's it's huge I think the L_C_D_ is huge , it consumes batteries like hell .
C :  Yes , I think so too .
D :  Why ? Nokia w
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh .
A :  I think it takes up a lot of a lot of power . It costs a lot , I think . What we could do , what could be possible , is maybe not an L_C_D_ screen but with a preview , but y I'm not sure if it's even possible . For example , a little T_V_ guide .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And it costs too much to fabricate , so we're on a tight budget here .
C :  Okay , uh
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Like you have a little just just a text only , not colour , just a little text thing so you can use your remote as a T_V_ guide . I'm not sure it's even possible , but maybe okay , make it Yeah , find a little compromise in that , but What did I write down ? I think the p yeah , the beep is a very simple thing to imple implement , just make a button on your T_V_ and just hit the button , it beeps somewhere . I think it's easy to implement , we should go for that . Uh speech recognition .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm . I have to check that out , I'm not sure .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That must be possible .
C :  Ja .
C :  I'm sorry , whe where do you wanna hit the T_ you wanna we want a button on the television . In th okay , but that rules out a universal remote control .
B :  And it's
A :  I thin Yeah , I mean where else should you put it ?
C :  Because that's not possible uh .
A :  Yeah , but how are you gonna use that if your I mean if your remote control is lost , how are you gonna press where are you gonna press the button ?
C :  Uh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Exactly .
B :  Maybe just a slap-on sticker with a button which sends out a small signal .
A :  A slap-on sticker . Oh , you mean as like a separate thing you can attach to your T_V_ . Yeah , that could be possible . A little little box you can attach to your T_V_ is fine then , okay .
D :  Mm uh .
B :  Yeah , exactly .
C :  Okay , then uh I'd I'd like to know now if we want the uh universal remote control or not , because that's uh determines everything I'm gonna do . If not Okay .
A :  I think it's universal .
A :  I think we should go for universal , because apparently we're a separate company making separate c remote controls to sell to a lot of diverse people . I think universal remote control should be possible .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Um
C :  Okay , then I go for that .
D :  Everyone uh wants to buy it , so we w yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think we're targeting everyone , so remote
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . No , it's fine with me , but then I know what to look for .
A :  Okay , universal is good . Speech recognition , I think it's very hard , because we're selling across multiple countries . So I think implementing speech recognition is such a small um apparatus , it's very hard to do .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Or one .
B :  And it's
D :  Or when you say one two uh i it uh it's enough , right ? But
A :  Yeah , but I don't see Arabian people speaking one , two uh whatever .
D :  Oh yeah .
B :  Besides that , the technology isn't really super yet , so that is a problem in implementing this .
A :  It's Yeah . It's not a mature technology , I think it takes a lot of memory and everything in in a remote control , so
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  It's a good idea , but it's just not I don't think the market's ripe for that yet .
A :  I don't think it should be implemented in a remote control yet uh . What else do we have ? Um well you should you should look into the in into the materials that are real durable .
C :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So the the the symbols won't fade , maybe a little harder plastic or especially li we don't maybe we don't have have to do all the buttons , but especially the ones that are um the popular buttons , so those always fade first .
C :  Exactly . I already noted that .
C :  Mm , okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  Mm the thing is the most important things that we have now . Let's see .
C :  Hmm .
C :  If we uh make a remote control with changeable covers , then we can also make uh a cover for every language area . That's fo is uh especially for older people , that they can read it read it in their own language .
A :  For example ?
A :  Well , we're not we're not targeting older people , we should remember that . Everything we target is under forty , so . You assume that that they read correctly and I think they're The most important thing about young people is that they're really sensitive to to trends that are passing through the world , so
D :  Yeah .
C :  That's okay , okay .
C :  Huh .
D :  But b
C :  Uh okay .
B :  But should the exchangeable covers include the buttons themselves or just the
A :  No , of course . No , I think it's just something you you put over them , because Yeah we c Yeah , you ca Well , tha that's not a that's not a bad that's not even it's not even a bad idea . I mean , for example , if you're if you're into the durability issue
C :  Hmm .
D :  But every
B :  C that's a problem with the with the text then .
C :  Hmm .
A :  you could For example , if your buttons are faded , after I mean if you make a durable remote , they are faded , you can just buy a new cover . Uh I'm not sure it's it's hard to make . So it's a good and a bad idea .
C :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Uh but I know that the buttons are like a Nokia telephone on uh one sleeve , so you don't have to change your whole cover . Uh we can make something that you can only remove the sleeve . Know what I mean ? It works the same as a Nokia telephone , it's it's in my uh 'kay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh .
B :  Oh yeah , I know what you mean .
A :  Yeah , I know , it's just just a one one piece of rubber for example , okay . Yeah , that's what I something I have to look into . Either either change both the buttons and and the cover or just the cover , I'm not sure which which is easier , so
D :  Yeah .
C :  Exactly .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Um anyway , yeah , this is what we're gonna do afterwards , just lunch break and have more individual work after that , so let's see what we let's see we
A :  So you have to come up with a components concept , yeah . I want some you should do some trend-watching , because even if we're if we're gonna do those covers and everything , what people really want , that's what we need to know in this phase , because that's gonna be the essential final design that we're gonna come up with .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um
A :  Yeah , I think user interface is fairly obvious . I mean it should be very intuitive , s Yeah , it should speak for itself . Uh for example I bought a remote control last week with a new T_V_ , it was it l it's like all buttons and you have no idea what it does at first , and I'm total T_V_ new , anyway .
B :  Pretty straightforward .
A :  So I think it should be have less or l very little buttons and maybe a second second level menu for the advanced things . Or maybe just stick 'em under a menu , like you said the um the sound options and the surround and whatever , they're more complicated , just stick 'em under one menu and uh give it a just put it in in s in a software piece , you can menu and you can uh select everything you want to to set on your T_V_ .
C :  Mm .
B :  Is it techni technically possible to uh send a signal to a television and then pops up a menu , because we're working with different types of television , so we're going to work with that ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  That is true .
C :  I don't think so .
A :  No , that's true .
C :  No , I don't think so . Because the television needs to respond to the signal , and if it doesn't know how , it's Exactly , that's not possible .
A :  Yeah , that's true .
B :  It's an in-built menu , isn't it ? Yes .
B :  So basically we
A :  I'm not sure if it's impossible , but uh there's a chance it's not , so .
B :  Or we could use a double-sided for less used functions you
A :  A double-sided remote control ? I don't think that's useful .
B :  Yeah , with the cover . I it's basically an idea to overcome these issues , because
A :  Yeah , but then you're gonna have a lot of wasted buttons . For example you have a Sony T_V_ and the half of the buttons won't function if you have a for a Sony that won't for a Philips T_V_ .
C :  Hmm .
B :  No , but basic functions but functions which are not frequently used . Because if we use a universal remote control , we're going to have to have most buttons on it , so
D :  Yeah .
A :  I don't think we should Yeah , for exam
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  I'm not s yeah , for ex you have to make it a little decision between the part if you want a universal remote control that it should do what people usually do with their T_V_s , not not the very complicated settings that you can usually do that with uh either a old old remote control if they really hate that thing , but
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
C :  But that might be broken .
A :  you can't you cannot take into consideration all the different brands of T_V_s . I think there's I think there is a standard for example between uh because usually the the menu is the menu button is is usable between different brands .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Especially the big ones , the big brands , so . 'Cause everybody I have a universal remote control and it can use the menu button , so I think I'm not sure , if you can put some research into that , if it's possible . Uh I think just a b and the navigation is very basic , it's usually the same thing .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Mm okay .
C :  Mm . But I think there must be a way uh to invoke the more complicated functions of a television . For instance , if your old remote control is broken and you buy ours , then uh you should be able to get everything out of the television that's in it . Because otherwise you'll lose functions by buying our
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's true . I think so uh we need to put some research into that if if we can open the menu , I think it's possible , just the way how to . Yeah , then then you could do everything I suppose , because usually the T_V_s have tha that inside in this other little piece of software , so it's okay .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , I thi I think so too .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  And I think that our r remote control should not look like uh any other . For instance uh Sony makes all their remote controls exactly the same for all their devices , and you always grab the wrong one because formatting of the buttons is exactly the same , only the labels are different . We should not do that .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah I think it should be a little distinct from everything else , because it's either it's both mayb maybe the shape can be a little different . Maybe it's a little more curves or whatever .
C :  Exactly .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I have some ideas .
B :  I have some ideas .
D :  Um yeah .
C :  Mm that's your uh division .
D :  And uh with different colours uh .
A :  So um
B :  I'll put some on paper and present them next time uh the ideas that I have .
A :  Yeah , this . Not sure what because we have forty minutes , I'm not sure how much time we have left for the meeting anyway , so .
D :  Okay .
B :  I heard a beep go .
A :  Yeah , but it wasn't me , it was him closing something . So anyway , yeah , we could do some i do some work now on on the design for example . I mean what do you want , do you want , but
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but we like some some curves or
A :  Yeah , may maybe something like this .
A :  But though smooth inside .
A :  So you have the transmitter here for example . Let's see that you what would be handy . I think that the the buttons should be the channel buttons should be uh on their own . Let's see one , two God damn it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh .
D :  And a light uh
B :  Oh , we get the general ideas , yes .
A :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Another one here . Let's see what I think this should these are always on top of the of the control , so they should be here .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah , and since you're holding it like this , I suggest you put the channel up channel down and volume yeah yeah .
A :  Think it's like this .
D :  Volume .
A :  Withi within the Yeah , just take it .
B :  So you have the up channel
B :  the down channel the volume , do we want that horizontal or vertical ?
A :  Do you take triangles or
D :  Uh it's it's fine , I think .
A :  Um I think it should be I think it Maybe we should make 'em bigger or whatever . Yeah .
B :  This is basically what people are accustomed to , so
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but this is just a g general idea . Uh maybe the menu button can go i in the middle .
D :  Oh d
A :  Yeah , in the middle . It's it's usually uh there , but
B :  Whoa .
A :  Mm .
C :  Perhaps we should also make uh something like a flash on it , if you if it's lost , for people that are deaf . They they won't hear the the beep .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but for example if it's lost in your armchair , we'll not see the flash .
B :  You won't be able to find it .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And flash takes up a lot of batteries again .
C :  Uh .
C :  Yeah , it's true , but it's it's only has to do so when you press the button that it's lost .
D :  Just
A :  Yeah .
B :  We could make a combination that it goes beep and that you that some light lights up .
C :  So .
D :  And L_E_D_ uh on it .
C :  deaf people ?
A :  Yeah , I thought about for deaf people for example , so . We could do that . Uh let's see .
D :  Just a light on it or
B :  So we have the basic channels we've got here , uh the power button
A :  Oh yeah , it's true .
B :  somewhere over here ?
A :  Um that thing should be central . You shouldn't be you uh shouldn't press it by accident , but it shouldn't be stacked away somewhere .
D :  Very important .
D :  Oh , that's
B :  I usually
D :  It's
B :  press it on top . At least that's what I'm accustomed to .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I have another idea , I'm not sure if it's possible .
A :  Yeah , like that's gonna work .
D :  And
B :  What would you like to ?
A :  Yeah , I thought maybe we should move the buttons down and put it here for example to
D :  But you r
D :  And you are reading from the t you always read from the top to the the bottom of it . Yeah , so it's
A :  From top to bottom . Yeah , that's true , you should I think the bu the power button should be on top , 'cause it's the first thing you do , turn it on . So power button on top . Um
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , mute button . Is that somewhere here ? Is that used often ? The mute button ? Do people use that often ? 'Cause uh I'm pretty much accustomed to it right over here , at least in general , but
A :  Mute . Do we hardly I think it should be at the bottom somewhere .
D :  So i it's sorry ?
A :  Mute . Turn the sound off .
D :  No , it's no .
D :  Uh .
D :  Hmm .
A :  I don't think it's important , but I think it I think it should be you c you could put it somewhere here .
B :  It's not that important , no .
D :  Or or with the volume selection .
A :  No , because it Yeah , people are accustomed to that , it's
D :  Around uh not uh not at top at the around the volume selection . I don't know where exactly , but
A :  Can I have that ? That's j
B :  Sure .
A :  Take this out and here see
A :  Uh are we gonna take triangles anyway ? I'm drawing triangles , but
B :  That's pretty much what people are accustomed to , aren't they ?
A :  Yeah , it's maybe a bigger lesser than thing . So anyway , I think this is should be
A :  the channels and or sh
B :  Well , I'm accustomed to the channels being on top .
D :  No . Yeah .
A :  Here , okay . Okay , should we chan okay , this two , channel
C :  Yeah , me too .
D :  Yeah , that's better . On the right .
A :  up and down .
C :  Shall we uh also look if it's possible to make a rechargeable remote ? That you don't have to buy new batteries if every
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , for that is it's on one part it's um it's a good thing to recharge it
D :  Maybe it's more ex expensive .
C :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Maybe we should what what could be possible is one with rechargeable batteries for example . You have just put Penlite batteries that are rechargeable , because it's an it's it's it's very annoying .
C :  Uh .
C :  But that's already possible .
B :  But isn't that expensive in the entire package ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  I'm not sure y I'm not sure it's if it's expensive , but just take a look at it , because it might be a very good idea . Because if it's it's uh useful to have it rechargeable , but at the same time , if you don't want recha if you forgot to recharge it and you wanna watch T_V_ now , you wanna be able to put different batteries in it , use it now and not in half an hour .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes .
C :  Okay . Uh you could make a device , but I'm not sure how that uh is possible with the costs , that you can put in normal batteries , rechargeable , but it you're the remote also can act as a recharger . So then you can choose , you have every decision . Know what I mean ?
A :  How about
A :  I think I have a nice idea .
A :  Not exactly uh .
C :  You can uh put in normal Penlites , rechargeable Penlites , but they can also be recharged with the remote , with a wire .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah yeah .
A :  I think it's uh it's a pretty good idea to have uh like sort of a maybe a base station that you put on the T_V_ . Could be flat , you could insert your uh remote into it .
C :  So but
D :  Yeah , that's g
C :  But I think that will cost a lot . Uh a normal wire would be better . Like a like a P_D_A_ , a hand-held . You can uh just put it in the electricity and it charges itself , you don't need basic station .
A :  I'm not sure . A what ?
A :  Well , we were talking about the fact that we wanted to insert either a beep or a flash into the thing with a little separate signal or So you could put that on a T_V_ for example . It could be very flat , could be very small . It's a very small Yeah , I'm drawing it big now , but So you can put your remote on flat for example .
C :  Yes .
C :  That is possible , that's true .
D :  But
D :  Which
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  And at the backside of remote just just just a little hole
C :  Yeah .
A :  for example um you just put it down , it recharges for example . I don't think it's very expensive .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But again , isn't that too expensive ? 'Cause that means that we have to implement rechargeable batteries , a docking station
D :  Yeah .
A :  I'm not sure if it costs a lot , that that's what he r
C :  Mm .
A :  That's that you that's what you buy yourself .
C :  Yes . I'm going to try to find that out . I'm not sure if there's information available on this , but
A :  It's just an idea , we have to find out if it's possible .
D :  But
B :  And do people actually want that ? To pay extra they want to pay for rechargeable ?
D :  Yeah , they want to pay for it .
A :  Do they want but they want a rechargeable one ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  I'm not sure , you should find out if it's if rechargeable is important .
D :  Th uh there was not a el ask esque
C :  Hmm . These are uh comfort issues . So I think people will pay they wanted to pay for comfort . Well , this is comfort .
A :  Yeah .
D :  But
A :  They want to pay for comfort , we just assu we we could either make a separate station which just sends a signal to the remote control to either beep or flash to find it , um and
D :  But f hmm .
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , we have to either that or make it integrated with a with a docking station .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah . Exactly . I think this is a brilliant product . I would buy it myself .
A :  I think it would be good actually . I like the beep part anyway . So um let's go through the
C :  Uh .
C :  I like the covers . That's a brilliant idea . I never thought
B :  Can can we save this or
A :  Covers is covers is good . Yeah , it's Oh we can save this . Up and saved . We even saved the ant .
A :  Um
A :  Okay .
A :  So what we have is you have I think you have to do a lot of work on if it's possible for the cost .
C :  I hope if I have information about that , I'm gonna
A :  Maybe yeah , or maybe you can find out i what people are willing to pay . We are going for twenty five Euros sales price , but just try to find out what they're willing to pay for it , because if they're willing to pay more , we could lose a little profit and maybe attract more customers , uh we just have to see what it looks like .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah .
C :  Mm . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I would like to make a decision . What it costs and what kind of materials that we can uh choose what we want in it and exactly , I need it .
A :  Yeah , if you have some financial information that that'd be nice , so . Hmm .
B :  Could you post some other essentials of what people want , so that I can work with some buttons , where to put it
A : 
D :  Yeah .
B :  You seem to have information on that , I'd like to uh
B :  see some of it .
C :  Was it not possible to uh send emails around the office ?
A :  No , it wasn't wasn't allo it was possible , not allowed , so .
B :  No , it's not . No .
C :  Not .
A :  So that's um why I'm not sure that you're allowed to share documents on the on the draft .
D :  Yeah .
D :  My computer crashed , so uh
C :  Yeah , okay .
A :  I don't care . I haven't heard any complaints yet , so . Um
D :  I lost my uh presentation , but
B :  Oh , your computer . Okay .
D :  I have the uh
B :  Well , I have your PowerPoint presentation , I can get some inf information out of that .
D :  Yeah , but I
D :  Here I have the the s the homepage of uh our
B :  Let's see .
A :  Yeah , the oh , they inc uh they include the new one . Or just for you .
D :  internet , and here is my
B :  Oh , where would we
D :  here is my marketing report , maybe you ca you can look at uh that and
A :  Oh no , I didn't have that .
B :  Where would we want the uh teletext button ? Because we decided that it's n not that important . Do we put it somewhere over here ?
D :  Ah yeah . And one
A :  All it tells just let's make make a new tick the new one .
A :  Um other side . Yeah , let's increase it a little because
D :  And uh wha what people want ,
B :  Or maybe this is something for the next meeting , I can draw out some ideas .
D :  I've uh
A :  Yeah , draw us up some some designs of of possible just keep in mind that the important buttons should be on top and either big , so the more less important
D :  I have another thing uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well , we have decided more or less the basic structure . I can put the other buttons in
A :  More or less .
A :  Just play a little with this , put l shift a little up or down and we'll see what looks best .
B :  Yeah .
C :  What uh what did you wanna say ?
A :  Or just po post your designs from time to time on the product share .
D :  Yeah . Um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh what I al already said is the the uh the remote controls are always lost , but it it's also for people , they want to learn it fast , not uh they want to
B :  Maybe another idea uh .
C :  Mm . Mm .
A :  Yeah , so we don't want we want very little buttons , just the buttons you use a lot .
C :  Mm .
D :  It's yeah , it's easy to learn wi and uh
B :  Yes , but it should cover all the functions , so possibly , just an idea that popped in
A :  Well what we had function that what people do , so . People change channels , people they change the volume and they they change channel , they turn T_V_ off and on , for example . That's the basic fu that's what you do I'm not sure who present that again , but those are the basic function that people use it for , so those should be very well represented .
D :  Um
B :  Yeah , but we could go a step further , because some T_V_s have the uh possibility to adjust brightness , that kind of menus .
D :  And
D :  The
D :  If
A :  That's true , but that's what we stick under the menu button . Everything is you say in every T_V_ that's configured under the menu .
B :  Yes , but it
C :  But that's the question , is it ? Because it needs to be configured in the television under the menu . If it isn't , then we cannot reach it .
B :  Because we're making
D :  Um
A :  Yeah , but
B :  We need to adjust to the technology .
A :  But I think most modern T_V_s have it in their menu .
C :  I think so too . I think so too . Uh isn't there a possibility to do research on that , so we know that for sure ?
B :  True .
C :  If you rule out functions , then uh and that gets known , then people are not gonna buy it . Then the consumer bond or something says uh you cannot do this and that with it . That's a bad bad com commercial for okay .
B :  No , I thi
D :  If um
A :  Uh we'll we'll see what we can come up with .
D :  Another thing I want to say is that uh we are looking at the market for the age uh younger than forty . Um on my report , I didn't uh ish I didn't show it in my uh presentation , because my computer crashed . Um they want to pay for an L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition .
A :  Under forty . Yeah ?
C :  That's true .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah yeah .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  The want to pay for Oh .
C :  Did they really said it like that ? Those two things . Do they realise how much that costs ? That's almost undoable .
D :  i yeah . Yeah , and
A :  Uh shall we ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Oh , we're not going to be able to sell it for twenty-five then , with an L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Younger , age sixteen and forty five .
D :  Uh but
A :  That's all here , here it says
C :  No , that's that's . Even if i if we have this lost unit , then we cannot do it for that price .
A :  Yeah , age sixteen forty fi interest in main features more critical . Okay , so we're not focusing on this .
D :  If if they
A :  Um
A :  All the interest in features , not really the L_C_ oh here . Would you pay for uh speech recognition in a remote control . Hmm , okay ?
C :  Yeah , that's true .
D :  So uh
D :  we can
A :  Speech recognition is quite
D :  We can look at the possibilities for an uh L_C_D_ and uh I dunno . Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , just look at the possibilities then , because if apparently it's what people want , it's supposed to be a luxurious remote , maybe it's not even that expensive . Or find a compromise , maybe just a black and white or for some extra information on it , on your programmes .
C :  Hmm .
D :  How much it will cost and
C :  Uh .
C :  Uh I
D :  Um
B :  Well I doubt it , but
C :  But I really need finance information .
A :  Me too . I mean we all do . Right . I think it's something we should put into consideration . Apparently it's what people want , so . We should see if what it costs , if it's possible .
D :  It will come uh
C :  We all do .
C :  Mm .
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , we should do a little thing about design , because it looks boring really to me . Even if you put it even if you put a different cover on it , it looks still looks boring , so .
D :  Different colours maybe .
C :  Hmm . And the design , it should differ . This is Philips , huh ? Philips has this .
D :  But all
A :  I have no clue . I just drew something what which would fit into your hand easily .
B :  Well , I had basically
C :  Okay .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Uh .
B :  Something like this . To make it kind of futuristic .
C :  Mm . Oh , I realise if we make it small , then it needs to be a little thicker , because I need to put all the electronics in it . If we make it s uh smaller , uh less wide , then we need to m make it a little thicker , because I have to put all the electronics in it .
A :  I think it's a very
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Okay . Mm-hmm . Yeah , but you have to j just keep in mind it shouldn't be too heavy . I mean we can stick it in in there , I think . Huh even if in the worst case we can even Could you give me the pen back ?
D :  Okay .
C :  No .
B :  So what kind of
B :  Yeah , sure .
A :  So let's say that people would want an L_C_D_ thing . Let's take take the basic design again , what we oh , crap uh came up with . I'll just make it a little bigger now .
A :  So a transmitter here . Anyway .
A :  We could let's say we have an L_C_D_ screen , people want an L_C_D_ screen . So then we should probably put it here .
A :  It doesn't have to be really big , but just just have to be has to be there . Think it's a good place , people don't
C :  Hmm .
D :  If you're reading from top to bottom , I think it's better to put it uh at the top . It's j
A :  No ? It's not that uh it's not the most important function , it's just an extra thing , it just you press the buttons on top , because your finger is on top .
C :  Me too .
C :  Ah but .
D :  Uh . But i if you if you are going to uh put the L_C_D_ on it , I think it's very important to use it , uh because it's use it uh
A :  How can you use an L_C_D_ screen ?
D :  But nee the function of it . So you can use it maximum , because uh it's a lot it costs a lot .
D :  So
A :  Yeah , but why I I'm not sure .
B :  Now it's pretty much tucked away in your hand .
A :  Uh if you t if you press a button , you can see it , ri I'm not sure wha I'm trying to imagine myself what it would look like .
C :  Hmm .
C :  No . M I personally would prefer it on the top .
B :  I'm
A :  You would prefer it n Okay . So we have three people saying it should be on top .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Huh .
C :  But it
A :  Okay , but then you would would s have to stack away your buttons somewhere else . Anyways .
C :  Hmm .
D :  It's expensive to build it , so
C :  Mm .
A :  Uh this looks a little
D :  you must use the maximum of it .
B :  I'm still not convinced of the
A :  About the L_C_D_s thing . Well if it if it's if it's possible wi if it's not too expensive , we should include it , because it's it's cool .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
C :  They want it uh .
C :  We should just try to make that if it's possible . If it is possible we should really do it , but we need that information .
D :  Huh .
D :  Uh . But uh
C :  Also keep in mind again , the L_C_D_ screen is very flat , but it needs transistors , resistors , I don't know what more and that needs space .
C :  So I have to look if that's possible .
D :  Yeah , I know uh .
C :  But if we
B :  So basically can I what we have to decide now is uh what goes on top . Do we put the volume control and the channel control here , or do we put it on he Would we like to press it in the middle ?
A :  Uh we have green now uh
D :  In middle of it .
A :  Or maybe we should m we could uh draw draw something a bit that has it on on on the bottom . Maybe in a circle for example , like we like in this example . I think this is not good , but for we could make circular buttons for example .
D :  In the middle .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yes , but we do agree that we keep this at the centre , because it's basically the most important function .
A :  For up and down , ma make it a circle on it , because it
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think the channel button should be in the centre . Channel button should be st stick together , for example here in this section . Because it's uh
D :  It's the most import yeah .
B :  Well , that would make them quite small . So maybe you'd put them here .
A :  We're not sure about the size anyway , just a general design . You can make it as big as you want . For example if you take uh
B :  Yes , but a big remote control probably not something which people would like .
C :  Hmm .
A :  No , let's see . For example just
C :  If we have a a space issue , we can also lose one battery . It is rechargeable , so we can stick with one instead of two . That might be an option .
A :  Yeah . I don't think if we if we even use an L_C_D_ screen , we need to , definitely .
D :  .
C :  Yeah , but if we need two batteries and an L_C_D_ screen , that means a lot of space that we need . But it has to be a little bit heavier .
A :  Yeah , but we have to see what the si what the size is . The L_C_D_ doesn't have to nee doesn't need to be very big .
C :  Okay .
D : 
C :  No , but the things behind it . space .
A :  Mm let's see .
C :  Like a process uh .
D :  Finish meeting now . It's on your computer .
A :  Finish meeting now . Okay , we will . So either
B :  So would we like this or would we like the
A :  We either we have to decide what what people want . Either this one , this this could be the luxurious one .
C :  I like this one more .
A :  So we have channel buttons here . I'm just drawing something uh . Uh
A :  I think this would this would look cool . You could have it for example
A :  small buttons here for some extra functions , so if your basic function's here , we should like we decided before , programmes up and down ,
D :  Uh .
C :  Mm .
A :  and volume here .
D :  Or
B :  Let's see what we have here .
D :  And uh what about speech recognition uh
A :  Well you can just no , I'm not sure if we can do that , but we could put a microphone in here for example .
D :  Yeah , yeah , but or or an L_C_D_ or an uh speech . I think it's L_C_D_ is better now .
C :  Mm .
A :  Just to do research into both , w what it costs and what it takes for space . But let's cut the meeting for now yes .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I'll try to .
D :  Yeah .
C :  One more uh thing I'd like to say , uh let's give this uh a name , and not like some vague serial number that no one understands , like with cars . Shall we all try uh to think about a name ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , okay , yeah , that's yeah , that's okay .
B :  So I think of a name .
A :  Yeah , let's think of a name , okay .
A :  Uh okay .
D :  Oh , good .
A :  Okay , at anyways , the the minutes will be on the on the web shortly , so there we go uh .
B :  So
B :  Yes , go and finish up and I'll see you at lunch .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Good luck .
A :  Yeah , to all .
D :  Same .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I've Do we uh save the ?
D :  .
D :  .
