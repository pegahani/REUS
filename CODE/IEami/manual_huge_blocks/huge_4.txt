A :  Did you get my email with the slides ?
A :  Ah . Tricky .
C :  I guess I have to change the pen otherwise . Will be completely different .
A :  Dunno . Maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats .
A :  Might be seat floor rather than person .
A :  Yeah , put it back .
C :  Yeah . And do you think it's .
A :  Yep .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Jo's making faces at me .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So .
B :  Matthew is uh late again .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Probably an important man . Um .
B :  So well it is important for him to be here uh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So what can you ?
B :  He he he
B :  You did work together didn't you ?
C :  Yeah we will yeah , so I will be able to to summarize uh our meeting , but still I think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer .
B :  Yes .
C :  I think we can put on the here .
B :  Yes . Yes .
C :  Uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items .
B :  Mm . Um yes but w we
C :  Um , can we have a phone , can someone
B :  Yes , maybe we should phone him .
C :  it's really w well designed .
B :  Um well
A :  Mm .
B :  Um , when he is not here we will just we just have to continue . Um so just for record I I will take uh notes again .
A :  Mm , object tracking .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  And um
B :  well first thing uh I was uh uh I got an email from uh from my superior again that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve Euro and fifty cents . It's uh well he said to me well uh
C :  'Kay .
B :  when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . There is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter .
B :  So we have to consider that .
C :  Yep .
B :  Good .
B :  so maybe Anna , you can have your presentation .
A :  Well we can't no we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design .
B :  Okay Matthew . Nice uh you are here .
C :  Great .
B :  Great . Great . Oh ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs .
C :  Yep .
C :  So I will start by the the basic one that uh
C :  fits into uh eight Euros actually , right , seven eight Euros , and uh well first for both they have um a special shape , maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , but uh it's like a surf board . And you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf T_V_ , maybe the web , and uh it's kind of interesting shape because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff . And also it's not too far from um a mobile .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Or browse .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
C :  So people are used to that kind of shape , right . Don't take care too much about the colour because w yeah we don't take yeah . So here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led yeah L_A_ L_A_ L_E_D_ ,
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now .
D :  I yeah .
B :  Eye .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  L_E_D_ .
C :  the on-off button , in red . Here would be the volume . On the on the left , okay , so easy to turn on t and off . And um so this is a very cheap version so there are maybe you can carry on uh Matthew .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  Uh-huh .
D :  Mm-hmm , hmm .
B :  Yes .
D :  Also so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually so you can go up and down the channels , uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  How can you change from V_C_R_ to uh T_V_ , by the way ?
D :  Oh no no no , this is a single this this is a model with just the T_V_ one . No no just sorry , this is a standard T_V_ one , we are not talking about that . So and then we have usually there twelve keys but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . The extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel .
C :  Okay yeah . Yeah yeah .
B :  Ah , okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . Actually .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay so it's it's t a very basic remote then , it's only
D :  It's a very basic minimal thing which you can which is which is also available in the market , actually that's what it that it i and would cost us to build it about eight Euros .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Seven , eight , ei eight Euros .
A :  Mm .
B :  Exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So this one model and uh yeah . Sure .
A :  Can I see ?
A :  Thanks .
A :  Okay I like the volume control , that's good .
C : 
D :  Th this is a magic one but I know we don't want to talk about that , you know like uh i i i it is a very futuristic , it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . So that uh then what we look t yeah .
A :  Uh-huh .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So it doesn't actually have buttons .
A :  Did you wanna see ?
B :  Mm-hmm . Yeah no you can carry on , I just
D :  This is a model , yeah .
B :  look how it feels all . Yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yep .
B :  Just I'm I really want to talk to it . But . So but but continue with your uh mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah actually , yeah .
A :  It won't talk back .
D :  Uh so well then the this is the a more a little uh smooth and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , so all we have uh th you see there are only six keys , but don't worry they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here .
A :  Right .
B :  Mm .
D :  And so they have more space actually and uh it's easy to uh use this and uh you have um so this is a standard uh uh infrared eye , and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo yeah s pause or stop , and uh then uh you can uh you have a L_C_D_ display , here and uh y this is a functional thing which can change like it's a toggle switch which could change the function say , y you press it
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Play , pause .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  From D_V_D_ player to television or something .
D :  Yeah . I really can change it , so
C :  Exactly yeah . To audio and to video on demand .
B :  Yes .
B :  Mm .
D :  Instead of having many switches , y
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes and and and then you get feedback via the L_C_D_ yeah .
D :  The L_C_D_ can display what is that on that , and uh well you can have a integrated microphone over here , or in the button th here , so which can uh basically you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . And here is a small L_E_D_ which is like blinking one , which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , and which is can be useful for the locating as I was talking earlier okay . And uh well then we have a cover basically , basically you don't need much of the time this , when you need you can use it , and this gives additional functionality that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing
C :  Yes .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  This is the orange button , the microphone .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  An yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Crazy dis designer , okay .
D :  to this cover you know . Design enter .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the L_C_D_ screen ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah . It's basically to do that .
B :  But but the L_C_D_ screen I mean is a very uh
C :  Yeah .
B :  well an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be
D :  Actually when you are watching the T_V_ , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , you know , uh you want to uh and this gives a protection to the L_C_D_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . Gives a protection because when it falls down or something
C :  Oh actually well .
B :  That th that's true .
B :  Mm .
D :  it it is it is is is it gives a protec it's more robust that way . Uh yeah . And you have very good chances
B :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Yes . Yes , more robust .
B :  Yes okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  It's low weight . You have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So the the cost is actually a bit more , it's uh it's it's sixteen Francs .
D :  It
D :  Sixteen Euros .
C :  Sixteen Euros sorry .
B :  Okay .
A :  So it's well outside the budget then .
C :  Then it's out of budget . But the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . And they say basically that the S_R_ system would be uh something like three Francs per item so three Euros sorry . And um
B :  But w
D :  Yeah .
D :  Three Euros .
A :  That's on top of the sixteen , or is it part of that ?
C :  No no no , part of that , yeah .
D :  Part of that .
A :  So that takes it down to thirteen Euros without the speech recognition .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Mm 'kay . Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well uh if you we can have if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys if you want to you know
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well I think th th yeah we should stick with uh a number of keys because if we add too much then
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah it it should not be cluttering up everything .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  it's too
A :  What's this one on the side ?
D :  Ah that's for the it's kind of a L_E_D_ for indicating your battery and as well as it's like a blinking one you know you can keep it aside .
C :  Locati . Location .
A :  Ah okay .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay . I like the shape of them , I do like the
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  the size and the the shape .
B :  Well well
B :  Mm . Be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe Anna you can uh give our uh give us your um
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . And maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two .
B :  Yes . Evalua evaluation and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at .
A :  Okay .
A :  Basically this is what we've talked about already , um , from the marketing point of view . We just wanna make sure that we've taken into account Yep .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well just
B :  do it quickly if if we al already .
A :  So it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . Um we just go through these and rate them as a group and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , so just average the score of those items , so
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  These are the things we identified as being important . Um the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . And then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So well do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now or do we wanna discuss them further and then evaluate them ?
B :  Um , n no why not why not discuss uh discuss it now ,
A :  Okay .
A :  So f just go through onto the whiteboard I guess . Not sure how this is gonna come out .
A :  So the first one was really very far below budget , would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that or just have the high profit on it ? 'Cause if we're only going to make it for eight Euros then we have a
B :  Mm , well my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight Euros we must think how can we improve it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And then I mean w w w you must just see it we can still spend this four and a half Euro and
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
B :  to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five Euros
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five Euro .
C :  Functionality .
A :  Okay so look and feel , innovation
D :  And now it easy to use .
C :  Easy to use .
B :  Mm .
C :  target .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And trends .
A :  Oh , you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? Is that part of both of them or ?
B :  Um well w w we can still discuss that . So um , and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas I mean adding things or uh removing uh of options because they are too expensive , but
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I've received uh a framework which we can do this . I mean did you have this this Excel sheet ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  No .
D :  No .
B :  No okay , this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve Euro uh fifty cents uh .
A :  No .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  So maybe we can start with this , uh , calling this one .
A :  Okay . Yep . So it's the pink .
B :  Th th this is the first design .
A :  And the other one's green .
B :  Yes .
A :  Okay , so look and feel ?
A :  Where um one is I've broken the pen again .
B :  Uh there is another pen .
A :  S yeah . Get that one . Um w one's bad and seven's the best . Sorry , one's true and seven's false . One's the best .
B :  Okay .
A :  So on a scale of one to seven ?
B :  'Kay .
B :  Okay . So . Look and feel .
B :  Well you already feel that uh pretty much I think .
D : 
B :  In i in my opinion
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , so I I I would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . But that's just half , we should also consider look , and then
A :  Mm-hmm , yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  i it looks
B :  quite conventional .
A :  Mm .
B :  Don't you agree ?
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  On the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at , so
B :  So maybe two . Hmm . Hmm . Ma ma ma ma maybe say say five
B :  I It's my opinion , but I don't know what what
D :  Well I will give it maybe we have anyways the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say you know . It though the look is fine but uh still I will give four in that case you know .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Four maybe .
A :  Four ? Okay .
D :  Four yeah that
B :  Four , four . Now we th th then we settle on four .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I will gi yeah .
C :  Uh .
B :  'Kay . Can you maybe fix the other
C :  Yeah . If you press like this not like this then you
A :  Mm .
A :  No that's the ink's dried .
D :  No . C can you get the batteries ? No no the battery has fallen down , that's i
A :  Battery's low , isn't it the ink ? The b that's the that that one ? battery there .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But
D :  No no it's not that , it's how to close a battery .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay ? Now it should be .
A :  Mm .
A :  No I think it's lost a battery .
B :  Mm , try it , just try it . Oh it will not ri mm , mm .
A :  No it's It would still write but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors .
D :  Is there another battery there ? Oh yeah .
A :  You got a second ?
C :  Try a
A :  Well we won't be able to tell .
B :  Yes , it it has a mm .
C :  Perfect .
A :  Is that working ?
A :  Did it come out ? Good . Okay . Because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , it's just a normal whiteboard marker but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard .
B :  Good . Good .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yep .
B :  Okay . So then then
A :  And the other one ?
C :  Wow .
B :  Ah .
A :  I think it's slightly better , um ,
B :  Mm .
A :  it's hard to tell from just the plasticine , but
B :  I I
B :  I
B :  When we want to include I I I'm doubting about this this component .
B :  It it it it breaks in your
A :  Mm .
C :  'Kay maybe
D :  No actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , it it's n i it is jus
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
C :  It's not a button it's a led , it's a
D :  It's a led actually which which 'll be covering in a curve
C :  Ac actually yeah it should be embedded .
B :  Mm , yes I see , mm okay .
D :  It's will be embedded there so it won't be really you know protruding or something .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Oh you can push push it again , you can push it .
A :  Yeah . The other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? 'Cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , maybe it won't work so well .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . No you it it not protruding actually , it will go in better into that
A :  Okay .
B :  Well r r
A :  I'd say two or three for that one , personally .
B :  Mm .
A :  Probably more towards three than two .
B :  I think the look is better but the feel is is is worse . So so I would also say this is four . But w w do you what do you think ?
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh it's fine I think . My just that um the feel is that um
D :  you right now you you don't see the feel because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Mm . Yes .
D :  This is how embedded one will
B :  Yes , it basically is the same shape .
D :  Yeah . It's a bas basically the same thing actually . You will be Except that in this c
B :  Mm-hmm . Mm .
C :  And the L_C_D_ makes it better . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . And you might have a slight thing for to forward and
B :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Mm , okay .
C :  So I will say two .
A :  Yeah it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yes , okay .
C :  I would say two , three .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So , consensus ? Two or three ? Two ?
B :  Two ? Mm . Two's good yes .
C :  Yep .
D :  looking like
A :  Um , 'kay . Innovation . The first one , not really muc
C :  Basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , right ?
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . Do we
D :  No but except for the design of the surf . You should be rea
C :  Yeah . The surf uh design .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  What What features are we actually including ? Are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ?
A :  There's nothing like that ?
D :  Uh no I think it's more of the feel .
A :  But th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all , it's just a straight-out remote control .
D :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . The only innova innovation is the shape .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Say about that .
A :  Okay . So there's no this uh look and feel thing , though that's not a technological innovation . So I'd be up for seven for innovation .
B :  S so that
C :  Yeah . You're right .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And the
C :  And the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . And um with many more functionalities , and can open and close the the bottom part .
D :  Yep .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , it gives it
B :  Yes . A and the L_C_D_ screen is
C :  Yeah .
B :  That's that's that's well it's quite innovative .
C :  And all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this .
B :  Mm .
C :  Uh could put it at one or two I would say .
B :  Yeah . Mm . Mm . Mm . Mm .
A :  Okay .
C :  Personally .
D :  Yep .
A :  So what is it , what are the innovations with this ? Got the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Uh
C :  Yeah automatic speech recognition .
A :  Is that in this one though ? Is this 'cause this is the
A :  Th th there were different options we discussed then , we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget .
D :  No , we ha
B :  We just diske discuss it as you designed it and then we will will try to get it in the budget .
A :  Okay . So the cost for these were what was the cost for the first one ? Eight Euros ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  So
B :  Eight .
C :  Eight .
C :  Well actually we have yeah to check again yeah .
D :  Yeah , eight Euros yeah .
A :  And this one was sixteen Euros .
B :  Yes .
C :  Sixteen .
D :  Sixteen Euros .
A :  Okay . So .
A :  Innovation for this one is two ? One ?
D :  It's a two , I would say two .
B :  Two .
A :  Two ?
C :  W W un to be one what would do we nee actually , yeah , I don't see okay , one would would be without buttons , .
B :  Why it is one .
B :  A man w w
A :  Mm . Well the speech recognition is a very good innovation I believe it , so
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah . So maybe we can put one .
B :  This this is it w with the speech recognition ?
C :  It's using speech recognition , yeah .
D :  Okay yeah .
B :  Well . Gi given that that it works , then it's I think one .
C :  Yeah , one , yeah .
A :  Give it a one ? Yep .
A :  Okay . Ease of use ?
D :  Uh
C :  So the first one is really standard , so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , right ?
A :  Mm .
D :  He is used to it act
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  They are used to it actually .
A :  Yep . So that's maybe a a two for ease of use .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Here there may
C :  Um , the other one is quite easy , tho though .
D :  Uh , though it has more functionality I think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . It shouldn't be diffi
A :  Okay .
B :  Hmm .
A :  So maybe a three or a four .
D :  Uh yeah , actually in fact I think it will be Yeah
C :  One me um we hope maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah but y
C :  And there is a like I would say three . Or maybe four .
A :  Okay .
D :  Well we have reduced the keys actually you see . Three is fine with me .
A :  Consensus ? Three or four ?
B :  Three , I would . Three .
C :  Yeah , yeah because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so ,
A :  Three ? Okay .
D :  Yeah it's a actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually , it's not so easy , like this one the normal .
B :  No .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yes but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy .
D :  Is quite easy yeah . Initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah .
B :  So so I think th three is good . Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Good . What's the next ?
A :  So three's uh how well it goes to the target demographic .
A :  So we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? That's
D :  Mm .
B :  So
B :  Twe twenty to forty , yes that's
C :  This one would be uh for grandmothers .
A :  Mm .
D :  Oh no , this would I I would I would give this model to the old people actually . Yeah .
C :  No .
C :  Yeah , grandmothers , yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So sh completely changed our demographic there , it's not part of the the funky young thing .
D :  And
B :  Well exce except for the surfing shape . I mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group I think , but
C :  Yeah that's true .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  If it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then I can imagine it being applying to the the demographic yeah . That's it's still Ye
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic
A :  Mm . 'Cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it , that's right .
B :  Mm .
B :  But as it is now , I w would say
B :  mm , six , something .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh yeah , .
B :  Do you agree ?
A :  And
D :  I Well I think
C :  Yeah because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets , the right range of people , right ?
D :  Yeah . Uh yeah but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . But w
D :  So
A :  But it's going to be cheap whatever though , it was set with i we've got a set price .
D :  And people can still decide to use the cheaper one
C :  Yeah .
D :  instead of a
C :  But for us it's yeah we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five Euros .
B :  Mm , yeah , indeed . Th t t
A :  Yeah . There's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few Euros on that one rather than another one .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Ju just think , twenty five Euros , I mean it's not going to be cheaper .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay . So in that case well it's fine then . We can yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Mm . Okay .
A :  Okay . Um and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ?
D :  And the demographics of
A :  It's got the got the the toys in it , it's got the L_C_D_ screen and
B :  Yeah tha tha tha tha tha that's I think it's better , because of the L_C_D_ screen which is really an appeal on the on the on the
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  on the and on the
C :  Yeah . And if you want to target yeah if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , I think for this audience we need absolutely the L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm . So , the L_C_D_ screen uh attracts , yes . Because it
A :  Yeah . I think especially if we're gonna n have an L_C_D_ screen on a low range product then that's good .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm , ma maybe that's something to consider , yes , so .
A :  Mm . Okay .
B :  Wh what what
A :  I'd probably go with three again for that one .
D :  Yeah I think it's uh it has more market actually .
C :  Or even
C :  Even one and two .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Y yeah , you know two .
B :  No s say t two . Two ?
C :  Or two .
A :  Okay . So , two , yeah ?
C :  Yeah . Two yeah .
D :  Yeah two yeah . Because tomorrow this will be more appealing because you can add lot of sophistication on that . Because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include for the people to
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yep . And especially I guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , and that makes it more appealing , it's more of a a new fun toy .
D :  We have to practically test it . The field test will tell you how good .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay , the final point , trends .
A :  And following the trends . So the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel .
D :  The trends .
B :  Mm . Mm .
A :  So as it is , not really doing either of them .
B :  I think
C :  Spongy ,
C :  uh , that means that it goes in in the water .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well , the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , I know some have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons and not not exactly spongy but I'm thinking one of the Nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons it's got just a one bit on it and so you can that feels kinda spongy .
C :  Uh okay .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah I know .
C :  But this one includes this feature , right ? Spongy buttons .
D :  Yeah . We we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually .
A :  So it's sort of , yeah .
A :  Mm . Okay .
C :  So
B :  Mm .
C :  Uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie .
A :  But that's if you're using the covers . Or is it just one
B :  And the then we can al yes . We can we can consider uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover
C :  Yeah .
B :  for s such a phone ? I mean
A :  Well they make it for mobiles , it can't be that much more complicated .
D :  But why do you want to cover that actually ? In that uh w in the mod
B :  Well just with the with the flexible plastic uh
A :  So you got the option of having different colours or different textures .
C :  Yeah . This is possible .
D :  Uh uh y are you sure ?
B :  I th I th I think
D :  Yeah I think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah .
B :  O o or just two things which can be put on each other .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah exactly like Nokia phones .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yes , exactly like it . Uh , so
D :  Yep .
B :  Maybe we can but we have to decide it , we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers and s now try to invest in the in in the features .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , it lets people have the latest fashion even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it and then it'll still be in fashion .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm mm mm mm mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  'Cause sometimes look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , and uh it's quite conventional , and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . So maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
B :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm . Mm .
A :  And then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers .
B :  Yes . So so so that that would make the trends equal , so we we we really have don't have ,
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . There's n yeah . 'Cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them . Although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um
B :  I mean
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , so a a point better for the for the number two .
B :  Yes , indeed .
A :  on the other one .
A :  Okay . So . Two and three , or one and two ?
B :  Yes .
D :  Yeah , it's one .
B :  Say , say one and two . One and two .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
B :  So le le let's see . So d this one has spongy but buttons ?
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , it says a
C :  Yeah , the blue one uh spongy .
B :  Mm , I see , yes okay . Good .
A :  Okay so the average of that is
A :  three six nine divided by five , so five
B :  Just add it . You know . Three , six , seven .
C :  Nine .
D :  One point six , one point
A :  nine by five , one point s eight ?
D :  One point eight yeah .
A :  This one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two yep .
D :  Four point
D :  Uh four point two .
C :  Very good .
A :  Okay . But we still got a very different price for those two so they're not really comparable yet anyway .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We we must try to get them closer .
C :  Yeah , it's right , yeah that's right .
A :  Yep .
B :  Both in i i or we just have to choose . And adapt . Because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap .
D :  Wow .
A :  Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . That'll basically take us down to the budget .
B :  Yes , well
B :  But I'm now did y did you work with the same prices that I have here ?
C :  So I I give yeah I just give a call with the manufacturer uh and uh I explained them and they told me this could be possible for sixteen Fr Euros . Uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip , uh Matthew , so maybe we have to recap with this one .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah . Yep .
B :  Mm , tha
D :  Maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah .
B :  Well yes , well uh re reconsider it . So let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , uh what kind of energy source uh I I we didn't speak about that . It's a it's a normal battery , or
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , it migh It it'll need uh more than a conventional one , it won't be uh just maybe you might use a A_A_ battery actually .
D :  What do you say , Mael ?
C :  For this one it's a normal battery .
B :  Yes . Just so one battery . 'Kay .
B :  Electronics . given speech recognition I think w you should go for the less fancy chip .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh sample speaker , yeah .
B :  Yeah , yes , or sample sensor , yes .
C :  Sample , yeah , this one .
B :  Yes , this one . Okay . Case ?
B :  Um ,
C :  So
D :  Curved . Double curved yeah right . It's uh
B :  I see I
B :  Double curve .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely .
B :  Mm .
C :  So which one are we talking to ?
D :  Are you talking about this or that ?
C :  Well
A :  Either of them .
B :  Oh yes , we are talking about , but they have the same shape , but , actually bu
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm . They're both going to be not basic cases .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So th th this would be double curves ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  'Kay .
B :  Uh , plastic would be the material .
A :  Yeah . The basic one , yep .
C :  Is it zero Franc ?
D :  A special colour ?
B :  Uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers .
D :  Uh
A :  So now we're either going button or L_C_D_s , L_C_D_ display .
B :  Push .
B :  Mm , yes , but
C :  L_C_D_ is . It's okay . Just say L_C_D_ .
A :  Is that price per unit , or for the whole
B :  Yeah th now this is per per unit , this number of components .
D :  Ah good .
A :  thing ?
A :  So it would need twelve buttons .
D :  Yeah , we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ?
C :  No but for this one it's twelve Euro .
D :  No , for that one also .
C :  There are twelve ?
B :  So , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , t
D :  Yeah that's a scroll .
B :  Yes . Twelve I believe .
B :  So this comes to eighteen .
A :  Mm . And that's without any special button supplements .
D :  Yeah , one scroll wheel you might need .
B :  So
A :  So we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . They're not just standard buttons .
D :  Uh
B :  So I think but th do you agree th that thi
C :  Wait a minute , it's not it's not double curved , it's single curved , right ? Because it's there is no like .
B :  Yes I
A :  But I thought it would be curved on two it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what I thought .
B :  Yes I'm I'm no I'm no I'm not sh
B :  sure .
C :  Well it's you know this curve like this so , it's w there is only
B :  Yes I kno undes I understand what you mean , yes .
C :  is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are yeah concave . So I think we can put um
A :  You talking about concave curves ?
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Both .
A :  You think a single curved ?
C :  the single curved in the sixteen .
C :  That makes uh seventeen . And what are just The bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? Yeah .
B :  Yes .
A :  Mm .
B :  Uh
A :  We have more , we've got those the scroll wheel on the side and yeah
C :  So I had a bad uh
D :  Bad estimate , right ?
B :  W d we have we haven't talk about a , but that's no a is very exp inexpensive I believe but it is not in the list .
A :  The sc
C :  bad estimation .
A :  Mm .
A :  We've got a scroll wheel for the volume don't we , or is it some other thing that's not on there .
B :  W ho h is this a scroll wheel or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ?
C :  No no no .
A :  'Kay we've only got five minutes left guys so we need to wrap it up pretty fast .
C :  Yes , a kind of scroll wheel .
A :  So this is even more than the um
B :  Mm . Mm-hmm .
A :  than the cost you gave , the sixteen Euros .
C :  Okay , so based on that , yeah , um where is the es okay sample speaker
D :  That is the sample sensor and sample speaker .
B :  So um
C :  But still , yeah it
D :  We just need that actually .
B :  We're
D :  We need one .
B :  We
B :  We could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , but then we can't have the the speech recognition , yes ? Yes ?
C :  No we cannot , yeah . So
B :  So so w when we w a this would this would be cutting the speech recognition .
C :  But the um
C :  Yeah but if you have the near the L_C_D_ you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio , T_V_ and V_C_R_ , and this needs a needs a advanced chip .
C :  Right , Matthew ?
D :  Oh I i it
C :  Or regular chip ?
D :  I think it's going to be y y yeah it's th with the regular chip , yeah .
C :  I think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip .
B :  Say say it's regular , regular chip , and we still on fifteen , so
C :  Yeah . Okay . Okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So . And what about the number of buttons buttons uh
B :  Yes but that maybe
C :  my Matthew ?
B :  Well we can just say
D :  Uh
B :  one .
C :  When you look at this w , this u uh item ,
D :  Yeah .
B :  Ca l we are just when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty .
C :  But
B :  So is it possible ?
A :  But that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material .
D :  That'll be then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  You cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really
B :  No no , he he he I I
C :  really low , no ?
A :  Well
A :  So the L_C_D_ display is is three Francs , sorry three Euros , by itself .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And uh we don't want to to change that right ? We we really want a L_C_D_ other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market .
D :  Uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this .
C :  It's evident .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  So twelve Euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , we can't do anything about that , so ten fifty , if we want an L_C_D_ dispra display , that's seven fifty
C :  And I dunno
A :  um , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons .
B :  Mm .
A :  And the chip . Sorry the chip's up there already .
B :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
A :  So we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , there's no doubt about that .
B :  A
C :  So wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the L_C_D_ , um
C :  Do you think it's important ?
D :  Or we could even replace them by buttons actually .
C :  Because sometimes whe when you watch the T_V_ in fact , you have a big display and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? I dunno , I'm just asking .
D :  A actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , or and you'll have L_C_D_ display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two Euros at least .
B :  Mm
A :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the L_C_D_ display .
D :  Okay so we can get rid of it and then add a couple of buttons .
C :  Yeah , it's true yeah .
C :  But uh , do we want that ?
C :  On the market point of view , yeah . What do you think uh , L_C_D_ is a major feature , or ?
B :  Mm . I
A :  For the price , it's gonna be what we can afford , and it's looking like we can't afford the L_C_D_ display , there's no way we can get it in there .
B :  I think we have to come to a decision now , just I I think we we what we just do i is vote
A :  Mm .
B :  about the uh the L_C_D_ uh display so
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  You assume , you want a democratic voyt vote , right ? Okay .
B :  Yes . Yes . Yes . One man one vote . S so who thinks the the L_C_D_ disply display should be i should be in it ?
C :  Okay .
A :  I th I'd like t it to be in but I can't see it happening . I can't see it fitting in .
B :  Mm . Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
D :  I think but
C :  We need to be .
A :  Bu y you're a power voter uh veto anyway as Project Manager .
B :  Mm-hmm , I know , but
C :  Yeah . .
D :  Yeah but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that .
A :  well we have to make a decision now , that's it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yes . So uh uh having an L_C_D_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . Is that acceptable ? Ca can I have can the functions be implement in an
C :  Yes .
B :  You've you you agree .
D :  W I I I just
B :  So hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons .
C :  Because one yeah th show me that uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . Here one , at the middle , and at the
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm . I think then we we're really losing ease of use .
C :  bottom .
C :  Okay , .
D :  That will create another problem . For the people to use it .
D :  It's not going to be easy .
B :  Mm . So um I I think we should we should cut the L_C_D_ screen . That that's that's my opinion .
A :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
D :  Doing that .
D :  No , it's okay , you uh cut the L_C_D_ screen and introduce two more buttons .
B :  Just
A :  Okay . So L_C_D_'s out , is speech rec out now ? We've
C :  The speech recognition is out .
A :  Yep .
B :  Uh where , L_C_
C :  Because of the budget , yeah .
A :  Yep .
B :  Okay w we now we can just uh
A :  So are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? Which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much .
D :  Yeah .
A :  With these new costings . So just look at forget that one and look at that one now .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yes . Yes . I th I th I think w we just go for this one and that that now twelve Euros is the
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
B :  is is the price , okay . My m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected .
A :  Okay . Well that's that's
A :  Yep .
C :  Actually yeah , we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount , yeah .
A :  So .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yep . So w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay , good . Then we the same . Thank you . That was it .
D :  Okay . That's it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Thanks .
D :  Cool .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Je croix que c'est dommage de le it will be sad to destroy this prototype . It really looks like a banana .
C :  It is a banana .
A :  It is a banana .
C :  It is the essence of bananas .
C :  I would be confused with this thing .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . Hi . So we are here for the detailed design meeting .
C :  How is everyone ?
B :  Hi .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So we will uh I will first present what we are going to do in this meeting .
A :  uh I've I will also take notes during this meeting and I will send you uh a summary then as usual . We will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues that make good work . And uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . Then we will uh evaluate the product .
A :  And uh end
A :  with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits
A :  with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So d let's start with the cost aspect so so I look at the aspect discussed last time , that is to say uh to have a standard battery , to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it to be uh to feel spongy ,
C :  Like a banana .
A :  and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . And the cost ended to be ten point seven Euros . So which is uh good , because we had a price gap of twelve point five Euros .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So for the financial aspect it's okay , we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if , and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert .
D :  Yeah . Okay . So uh you can have my project in
A :  Yeah .
A :  You have a presentation ?
D :  Uh yeah just a
D :  Four .
A :  Participant four , yes .
D :  Evaluation .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay . So you can go . We can go through .
A :  Okay .
D :  So I made an evaluation and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . So you can go through and okay so uh we have uh six points . We
A :  Okay .
D :  we talked about before . So we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , uh and uh uh I have a scale of uh seven points . Okay . So I go through all the uh all the points here , and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point . Okay ? And after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  The okay ? Uh so uh fancy look and feel , what do you think ? F between o one and seven .
A :  Okay . Maybe you can presen okay . Maybe hold it . So I think it's uh very uh very nice . What do you think ?
C :  I give it a I give it a five .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So it's between one and seven ? Seven is the highest uh ? I will give a six .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Seven is the
B :  I will give a a five .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  sorry .
C :  And you ? Do you vote uh Christine ? Do you also vote ?
D :  eh ? No , I just want to see something
A :  Maybe we all have to agree on a common
C :  Well , we can very easily .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Uh I think uh and need to as well .
A :  No problem . So this is your
D :  Need to uh I don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f
D :  If it's better or
C :  I
A :  One is most .
D :  Uh-uh .
D :  Um .
A :  Well , we can choose what we want . Okay , let's say that seven is the best .
D :  Yeah . Or maybe we can say s seven is the best mm .
A :  Okay .
A :  So so do note the grade we have five , six for me , five . And what what's your choice ? How much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ?
B :  Five .
D :  Oh sorry . Six
D :  Uh s you can how much what ?
A :  How much would you you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ?
D :  Oh yes I mm I dunno mm , I think six , it's a good uh
C :  So it will have five point five average .
A :  Five point five average .
D :  Yeah . Wa can . Okay . I sorry .
C :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , does it
D :  Okay . So after , the technological aspect ?
A :  Okay , techne technological aspect .
D :  So we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel .
A :  Yeah , we have the wheel . We also have the rubber material ,
D :  Uh .
A :  which make it uh
A :  new also . I think I would give a five .
C :  It's four .
A :  Four ?
B :  A four also , because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . The rubber is
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  D are we including the voice are you glu are we including the voice in the end or not ? Huh ? No . Okay .
B :  Uh a four . I I
A :  No .
A :  So what's your uh grade ? Four ? So we have four , four f and five ?
D :  No .
D :  Four .
D :  We can put four ? Everyone is okay or four poin
C :  Yeah . For twenty five .
A :  Yeah , four .
A :  Four , yeah , let's put four .
D :  Four .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Doesn't it
D :  Very easy to use . Do you think it's easy to use ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think so . Yeah . I would give a I would give a seven as well . It's very easy to use .
C :  I give a seven , I think .
B :  Six .
D :  Mm , six for me also .
B :  Six .
C :  'Kay .
A :  So six point five .
D :  Six point five . Okay .
B :  Six six six point five .
A :  Okay .
D :  Is it fashion ? Seven ?
A :  Oh yeah , its its f its fruit fruit shape . I would say seven . And is very very nice design .
D :  Yeah it's fashion , because it's a fruit , and we say that the yeah , seven .
C :  Yeah , we can we can put a seven here . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , seven .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Seven , okay .
C :  Well , we hope .
B :  Easy to find .
D :  Uh easy to find in a room ?
B :  I lost my banana .
A :  I think you can't miss it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh .
C :  Yeah , I think it's cool . I think we can put a six here .
D :  We have the lightning , or
D :  The lighting .
A :  Yeah , we have the we don't sesh especially have the lightning but
C :  So you'll make the material transparent so that it uh lights up completely , or
A :  So it's yellow . It's okay . I think it's very easy to I would say seven . It's hard to miss it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Seven ?
B :  Six . Yeah , okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Is it is it robust ?
A :  Yeah , it's rubber , made of rubber , I think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control .
B :  Uh f yeah , it's ru it's rubber .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , they will , I don't know
A :  Yeah . But it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material . So maybe we can put a six .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Everybody is okay , six .
B :  Six or five . Five .
A :  Six is okay ?
C :  Six , yeah , for me .
D :  Yeah . Okay . S now um so .
B :  Six .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Tadada .
A :  We have to sum up everything .
C :  Twenty .
D :  Thirteen uh , twenty , twenty six point five , uh seven , thirty two , thirty six . That's that's okay ?
C :  Thirty . Thir
D :  Six .
A :  Six is a good
C :  Okay .
D :  Good . Uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better , and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product , I think .
C :  Yeah , the top
A :  Yeah , the be .
A :  Okay , so six is a
C :  Mm .
C :  So will become eight soon ?
A :  So it's a good evaluation , I think . It's very promising .
C :  Yeah , well it's a bit biased .
D :  We have a good price and uh .
A :  Huh .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  Good .
A :  So this prototype is quite nice .
C :  Because I saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , uh quite big also , and they were selling something like a hundred Euros , two hundred Euros .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Just a just a phone , wireless .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So having this at twenty five Euros is uh quite attractive , I think .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare .
A :  I think the
C :  Yeah . Yeah , it's much more complex , but
A :  Yeah .
A :  So , I think , we can summarise . So we have seen the prototype . It's very nice according to the work of our two designer . The the the financial aspect were okay . We we have the cost below uh our threshold and so we could sell at twenty five Euros and make i make profit .
A :  The the evaluation give satisfying result as well . So I think we can move to the last part of the meeting .
A :  So the cost is in the budget , the evaluation is okay , so I th I think we can now uh open champagne and make a huge party . I don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff . Okay so congratulation .
B :  Start to eat banana .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Congratulations to the team . Uh very well , we worked together fantastically .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Nice product .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think it was a good collaboration uh .
C :  So what does the management say ?
A :  Aspect .
A :  Sorry ?
C :  What does the management say ?
A :  I think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well .
C :  Ah .
A :  All it depends on who watch this meeting . We don't know .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so good guys , so see you for next uh successful project .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . Fruits .
D :  Mm 'kay .
C :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm . So , ready ?
D :  No not really . Just
C :  'Kay .
D :  Crap .
B :  Sorry , I I um I'm afraid
D :  Okay .
C :  It's perfect .
A :  Your judgement it's is biased .
B :  Uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype .
D :  'Kay , so whe where is the remote control ?
A :  So , we are So
C :  Where ? It's here .
B :  Okay .
A :  let's go for our detailed design meeting .
D :  Yep .
A :  So I will still play the role of the secretary , and we'll have um first the project presentation by our User Interface Designer , David Jordan , and our Industrial Designer , Baba .
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control , and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost .
C :  'Kay .
B : 
A :  And in case if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . So maybe I will let the our two designers talk about so their You have s oh , sorry . Oops .
C :  I have slides .
B :  Okay .
C :  Ah , that is three .
B :  Effectively one slide and maybe we can discuss everything .
C :  Product prod
D :  What slides ?
C :  Yep .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  So , this is our product or prototype .
C :  This is made by clay .
A :  Looks strange .
C :  Yeah . Uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . Yellow is uh our company colour , uh red it's uh is more attractive . So we used two basic colour , yellow and red . And the shape , there's two basic shape . The first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . It's we call it a mushroom design . It's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . So this is a introduction of our product . Next a mo
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh
A :  Genetically modified mushroom I will say , but keep on speaking .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , yeah , so next slide . So there are several key features of our pr prototype . The first is that it is fuzzy . I'm sure this would be the unique design the market . Yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . Um , and uh
A :  Oh . Maybe , I hope so .
B :  Yeah , yeah I'm sure .
B :  Yeah , that's true .
C :  the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . In the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . So it's quite convenient for user to use it .
A :  Yeah , okay , but don't touch don't destroy your prototype .
C :  Yeah , s okay . Uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . Uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so
C :  uh so it's it's um it's unlikely you cannot found it . So it's v Um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel
C :  and there's some cute button . You c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so
A :  Everything's mushroom . So we can call our remote control the mushroom .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , everything's mushroom . Mush
B :  Yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know , centre is yellow and t d
C :  Mushroom design , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it .
B :  To integrate , you know yeah .
B :  I don't think I hope nobody will eat it . You know , to integrate the fruit aspect , you know the the in
C :  Yeah .
A :  Oh .
D :  Yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . I mean there was fruits yeah . Yeah .
B :  Really ? But
A :  Fruits and vegetables .
B :  Fruit and vegetable , so mushroom was a kind of you know uh
A :  Vegetables . Mushroom is a vegetable .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I don't think it is .
A :  It's vegetable .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mushroom ? Oh , uh I'm not sure . We can it's a veg a kind of vegetable , but you know we we integrated them with different colour .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So th it's something eatable .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  But anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I I think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . This , you know , very enlighted colours , you know .
D :  No , I mean , yeah yeah . Inspira inspiration is
B :  And inspired colour and and very sophisticated material , so .
D :  True .
B :  And so
C :  Yeah .
A :  Next slide .
C :  Uh , no this our only two slides .
B :  So what we w what I can add is that , you know he talk about what is outside , so what is inside is what we dis what we talked before about , you know , the chip , it is a low level chip , and
C :  Yeah .
C :  So we cut it to see .
B :  You know , we don't need to k . You know wi the low level chips inside and you know the L_C_D_ button and the i
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay . So where's the battery battery ?
B :  The battery it is under . It is in th in in the base , yeah .
A :  In the base . In the basement . In the basement . And where is the solar solar cell ?
C :  Base . Here ?
D :  But we say uh we sa we said solar .
A :  Where is the solar cell ?
B :  In fact this this this this is a kind of you know revolutionary solar receptor that we can put outside and I don't think so , but it it's might be okay , so . I it might be okay . So
A :  Oh . Do you think it won't be It won't cris increase the price ?
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , we'll see after . We will have first to so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ?
C :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I mean , we gonna try to measure how
D :  good it is instead of just talking about uh we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design , and first one was uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  look and feel .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , one being uh no , I think . Uh just let me check .
B :  So , four point three point five , it means it's acceptable .
D :  One one being true , and seven being false . Okay . Ouch .
B :  Oops .
C :  Okay .
D :  Do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ?
C :  Yeah , I think so .
B :  I think you have nice colours . I don't The sha the bowl shape people like .
D :  But is it
C :  Yeah , the shape is unique , and the colour
D :  Uh I'll agree it's unique , but is it really
B :  Is it really fancy ?
C :  So it depend on how d do you define fancy .
D :  Yeah I mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look .
B :  But it's you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , and maybe do things like that
B :  Do Don't do that , please .
D :  I dunno where the lemon is , but I mean it's not obvious .
B :  I it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so
A :  It would be bet more like a lemon ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  If
B :  Because i
D :  I dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or
A :  Yeah .
B :  Less button .
C :  so , my mush .
A :  Looks like more fruit . Maybe a pineapple ?
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , but you don't have any button now .
D :  Yeah . I dunno .
A :  And you know , you have the
A :  finger here , with the buttons ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
B :  That's uh yeah , is that that's a good idea . So that's great . That's great .
D :  Yeah , it's getting
A :  It looks more like a pineapple . Sorry . What's the use for that ?
C :  Uh , for turn turn the ball . If you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel .
B :  I have no idea , so .
B :  I have no idea what
A :  And where is the voice recognition ?
D :  Okay .
C :  Uh .
C :  Ah , it's embedded , your microphone . Th this th th there's two two functions . This is microphone array
D :  Yeah , that's
A :  Okay .
D :  Wait th that's the second point . First one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel .
B :  If it is fancy or not .
A :  Okay . Is it better like that ? Looks okay , let's say it's a pineapple now .
D :  I mean
B :  So we can we can say t
B :  The colour , is the colour acceptable ?
D :  No , the colour is okay , that's fine . I mean it's but I would say there is more too much red .
B :  So the shape now .
A :  It looks like a now you took it .
B :  It's too much red ? In the basement ?
D :  Um if
A :  It looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . Mm uh
C :  Okay .
D :  Right . So , from one to seven ?
B :  I will give I will
A :  Seven is the ma the maximum ?
B :  I'll gi
D :  No , seven is false and one is true .
B :  I'll give two or three . Three , it's okay . Three , three . Three is fine for me .
A :  Three , I will say three .
D :  Three ?
D :  Okay .
C :  'Kay .
D :  Three .
A :  Isn't it bitter like that ?
C :  Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Then uh let me
B :  What other
D :  The other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative .
B :  Is it easy to use ?
A :  Feasible ?
B :  Ye uh
A :  You said previously that you there's um microphone inside an
B :  Embedded .
C :  Yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . There four microphone . So they they they they there's a microphone array .
B :  It's a micro array , okay .
A :  Oh . Okay , and you have the there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? And you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ?
C :  Yeah , yeah . So you can capture voice yeah , you c
B :  Oh yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . Yeah .
B :  And I think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is
D :  Yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh I dunno , in the core , or single .
B :  W Yeah , but
A :  We have tactile buttons .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I see , you have microphone array embedded . You have That's good . And you have , you know this ki this solar receptor that , you know Yes . Yeah .
D :  No , that's good . Yeah .
A :  Oh , yeah .
D :  Yeah , th that's another really good point . Maybe okay .
B :  I think technically it's acceptable , so
A :  Maybe two ?
D :  So using the same scale , two ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Two ? I would say two . You agree ?
B :  Two , yeah , two . It's it's fine , so .
D :  Okay . Now maybe the most critical one .
C :  Yeah , I agree .
A :  It's better like that , isn't it ?
C : 
B :  Most
A :  Okay .
D :  L last one w I would like to judge is
D :  is it easy to use ?
B :  Eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . But it's just speaking . You just need the command .
C :  Yeah , it's very easy .
D :  Yeah but this this turning can you can you just re explain me the
C :  You can use this in this way .
B :  As a principle .
D :  Please .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Th this is the base . So you can turn to change the channel .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ?
C :  You just tu turn d d
B :  I think maybe if you he
D :  Like if you want to go from
A :  Oh , ok I understand . You take take the remote , so and you can turn like that to change the channel ? I think it's quite easy to so s zapping , but maybe it will be too fast .
B :  If you hear some click
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but imagine you y
B :  Yeah , it would
D :  Yeah I'm I'm no I'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , I dunno , one to twenty ?
B :  Oh yeah , that's difficult . That's dif that's difficult .
C :  Yeah .
D :  How can you go directly to twenty , for example ?
C :  No , no , no . I if y uh if it depend on the the angle you turn the
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . I agree . I agree . But I mean if you're fro from two ?
B :  Yeah but y how you need to know I
C :  I if if this is a channel one . So it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . So change . Yeah .
B :  I think something that Yeah .
A :  Yeah , you have a , like that , and so on .
B :  And you you can
D :  Yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh
A :  Oh yeah .
C :  Y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree . So you got how many degree you you it
D :  We're not talking
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go
B :  I think you can if you have a scale , so
C :  No no , you don't have to y no it's uh when you when you stop t uh when you stop , the
C :  the turn ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you
D :  Yeah . How d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ?
C :  It's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the
D :  So you you count one degree , two degrees , no .
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . You can do it .
D :  I don't think so .
B :  Yeah , it's a bit difficult .
C :  I think so I think so you can do it . I think so , you can just change .
B :  I think b but the the vocal command is easy too . You can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so
D :  Yeah voc vocal command is okay . But w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main
C :  There's uh also a number , you know .
A :  Yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , so you're passing through all the channels . So , when you say I want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . But if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . Just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ?
B :  Uh , yeah , and y that's yeah .
D :  And this would be more for browsing , ah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  To see uh yeah uh
C :  Mm-hmm . Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Seems to be good .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Good choice , mister David Jordan .
B : 
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I mean you're famous . You .
B :  And but I'd
C :  And also you can , if you i
A :  yeah , what's what's this cherry ?
C :  You ca you can turn this . Or you ca you can you can also turn this . For this you can tune it's for tune . You you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . If you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . It's like fine , from coarse to fine . This is coarse , this is fine .
B :  It is a turn off t turn off button , maybe .
B : 
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , yeah yeah . That's
A :  Okay .
C :  So it's coarse to fine design .
B :  that's very technologic , so . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay the uh th this looks better . Yeah .
C :  Yeah is is this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . This is from one channel to
B :  S But I di I didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates maybe one of the
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , th you have the vocal commands .
B :  Uh it's k on off , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  On off .
D :  Yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas
A :  Most of the time you have the yeah it's a sleeping remote control .
B :  Yeah , sleeping .
D :  Ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah .
A :  That's true . W that why we have the solar ti yeah . So three .
D :  Solar .
B :  To compensate . Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  So , which number ?
B :  Easy to use , it's very relative but three it's fine , I think , it's reasonable three .
A :  Do you agree ? Three ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , agree , agree .
D :  So reasonably , is four , is one ?
B :  Three f three for me , it's o it's okay . Four or three . Maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives and no and just take the mean .
D :  So , three .
A :  And what's your opinion ?
D :  Uh we wouldn't say , I mean , those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . I'd like I mean this is the just a prototype . I'm not really convinced it's so easy to use , but I don't know .
B :  Will you give
B :  four ?
B :  Five ?
B :  Yeah , so maybe if
C :  Uh w w what do y what uh you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? I think it's easier than traditional controller . If you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , you have you just turn the turn the ball . There's two kind of balls , the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . But in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but y you know
D :  So you have yeah .
D :  Uh by pushing zero after after the first one .
B :  You just push two button , zero and and one . And that's
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Are there some buttons ? Okay .
C :  Yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one .
A :  It's not what you said previously . Previously you said that turning this was the fine
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , if you're changing your mind .
D :  Fine to coarse .
A :  Fine to coarse . And from ten to ten channels here .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . Ten to twenty and this one , t one two three four five six , like this .
A :  Okay .
C :  Uh there's different scale , so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc
D :  Okay . But this this has to stay on the table , right ? This has to stay on the table .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  In fact on a flat place
C :  I i this is just a base . You can just
B :  You can
D :  Yeah but then uh when you turn turn it
C :  Yeah .
A :  Oh
B :  Oh ye yes , that's right .
A :  Yeah , no no , no . You can't put it out . It's just your turning from the base . You need to have everything in hand . If you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . It's impossible . You need to put it on and turn .
D :  Just
D :  It's
B :  Oh my God .
D :  Yeah .
D :  You know tha that's the weak point , because with a traditional one you just have one hand .
C :  You use your y
A :  Yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say I've lost the remote control . Nobody would take it . So nobody w will lost lose it .
B : 
C :  So th this is a d next generation controller . Yeah .
D :  Sure . Yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  yeah maybe , maybe may it's the next prototype , maybe we cou
C :  Okay okay , okay .
A :  S maybe we can change from th
B :  Four . Maybe four , it's okay . I'll put four .
C :  Four . Okay .
A :  Four ? Easy to use , four . Gonna say four .
D :  Four . Uh it's even easier to maybe .
B :  Yeah , four it's more reasonable .
B :  You can you can erase with this er yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , four it's more reasonable , so .
D :  So , average ?
B :  So it's nine , nine over three . Oh yeah , it's .
D :  Three ?
C :  Three ?
A :  Trois . Three .
C :  Trois .
D :  Okay , so
B :  It need maybe some wo further work , but it's
D :  Yeah , especially on the easy to use
B :  Yeah , uh s yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  target .
B :  Might it might be fine .
A :  So , th the project is accepted ?
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , b I think
A :  But I d m I think that it will be good to do some more work to transform this into a pineapple . If you re we really want to have a fruitful remote control .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  So uh mm mm . Mm .
B :  That's the finance .
A :  Okay and we we had a project prototype presentation with the
A :  evaluation . So as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
A :  So we need to calculate the production cost . As I said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty Euros . And if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . So , just have a look at the okay here is the
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  sheet , so so it has the energy source . We have hand dynamo . No , we don't use that . We have battery , right ? Kinetic , we don't have it , I suppose , but we have solar cells . Um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? Do you think one would be enough , or such as
D :  No .
B :  Yeah , we have battery .
B :  No , um solar cells , yeah .
B :  Uh I think in each ball you have three three uh yeah , three , yeah . Three three solar cells .
A :  as number of branches ? Three ? So , electronic .
A :  Single simple chip on print ? Just one would be necessary ? One ?
B :  S s simple , simple , yeah . Yeah .
A :  Zero for the others .
A :  And sample sensor , sample speaker .
B :  Mm . One maybe , yeah .
A :  One ?
A :  As we have voice recognition , I think .
B :  Yeah yeah yeah .
B :  Is it
A :  So the case .
D : 
B :  Is sh it
D :  So we are all already nineteen .
B :  Wooden .
A :  Okay , just keep on going , just to have an idea .
C :  The solar cell is too expensive .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Is Yes a wooden pl I and that's There's no wood , so plastic just only , I think .
A :  Well uh yeah , but what what about case ? Uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . I think it's more like double curved .
D :  That's gonna be double curved , yeah .
B :  Double curve , yeah , double curve .
A :  One ?
B :  One , you have .
A :  Uh wood ?
B :  But it's yeah , a a rubber uh
D :  Rather four buttons . Oh no , interface .
A :  Uh do we need special colour ? Y maybe , two ? We have two special colours . Push button .
B :  Yeah , yeah . Y y yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure .
C :  Mm . Yeah , we have four .
C :  Five .
B :  Five ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Scroll wheel . We don no .
C :  No .
A :  It it's more like integrated scor .
B :  I think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . Y you tu you turn you turn it , so
C :  No no .
D :  Yeah tha that's wheel .
C :  No no no , it
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , true . Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
B :  Okay , yeah , yeah . Scr
A :  So , no button supplements ?
D :  I think the price is okay .
C :  No .
D :  Um , no .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay we I think we have problem .
B :  L_C_ display , maybe . Interface .
A :  I think we s if we keep on adding things so we have to
B :  It's okay . fine .
D :  Yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells .
A :  Maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Has it changed .
B :  Yeah , it was stage one , so .
D :  No y i it did change , but just imagine we have
A :  Okay .
C :  We have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . Oh .
B :  So
C :  We have to delete the the sample sensor , I think .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but we have you the the voice recognition , no ?
D :  Yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really
C :  Yeah it's the one it's m maybe we ha we have two versions , the first version , the basic version . Advanced version we have speak .
A :  Okay .
B :  I think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . Because uh it seems that this can be yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , if
A :  Or it would be better .
C :  Plastic is free .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So , do we need special colour ?
D :  Yeah , that's one of the requirement .
A :  Because we have red .
B :  Yeah , red and yellow . Fancy .
C :  Wait .
A :  Red and yellow .
D :  We could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . Black then is a regular colour , so .
C :  We we can we can we c yellow .
A :  I think so we need if we try to have a kind of
D :  Yeah , one .
A :  pineapple bee .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So push button then it's it's the next expensive one .
A :  Yeah . An but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . And I think this is one . Integrated scroll wheel push button . So we'll we have only one ?
D :  Yeah , thi this might be .
A :  And push button . So if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh
D :  Close to .
B :  One .
B :  I can remove maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , I dunno , try to modify some of them to have yeah .
D :  Okay , so what's the bottleneck ?
C :  How about we change the sale ?
D :  Double curved .
B :  Double curve . We can transform the double curve into single c yeah . F some
A :  Something flat .
D :  Yeah , but flat
A :  S uncurved . Yeah , maybe not .
B :  Single curve . Single curve should be fine , so .
D :  Case , what's the ca
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh , what
A :  Mm . Nearly .
D :  And then one Euro left .
C :  Ah we have one
D :  Um .
A :  Maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . I think there's a problem with the push push button . We only need maybe just one . Just one . Yeah . So yeah , you will have So one button , and s
B :  It's it's a bad idea , so .
D :  Um
B :  Two ? One . That's fine . That's fine . One s one scroll wheel , so And the vocal chord , it's fine . It I th it's fine .
C :  Okay . Okay . Agree .
D :  So we have one button ,
D :  one wheel .
A :  scroll wheel with push button on it .
A :  So
D :  It's good they're not charging anything for that .
A :  So , yeah . It think we we've done good job , as the cost is
C :  Cou could we have look
A :  twelve fifty e
C :  Could we have look at the p the the prod the p the cost ?
D :  Yeah y actually it's wrong . We're not under twelve Euros and a half .
A :  Yeah , but it's under or equal . It's not written . Sometimes it's under or equal .
B :  It's fine .
B :  It's under or equal . It's fine , so
D :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Okay . So let's say
A :  Twelve fifty .
C :  Wha what yeah .
B :  It's fine , twelve fifty uh
C :  Which part is the most expensive part ?
D :  Solar cells .
B :  The solar cells , r is i is it ?
A :  Yeah , I think .
C :  Yeah , I think it's not t t
A :  I think , yeah . But it would i be interesting for our marketing team , to make a lot of advertisement concerning these solar cells to be
B :  Yeah , to be able to si to sell it .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Cheaper .
D :  That's nice argument , but if it's it's still four our of twelve .
B :  Yeah , with mi
B :  It's it is really really uh really very very expensive , though .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Maybe if uh okay .
A :  Yeah but it will be technologically innova innovative , so . So it's easy to use and powerful , as the remote control a has only one button .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah but we just have one button .
D :  Easy . I don't know about powerful . Yeah .
B :  It's easy to use . It's very easy to use .
A :  Easy , powerful .
D :  Mm .
A :  So I don't think we need to redesign the p the product .
D :  Uh that's what we've just done .
B :  No .
B :  We've done it with it is under the if it was low , high or so .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So
D :  okay .
A :  Now
B :  So
B :  So what are we going to do with this project evaluation ?
D :  Well I think we have just have to discuss if
A :  So
B :  Okay , okay , it's fine .
D :  I dunno .
A :  So did you enjoy your clay modelling ?
C :  Yes . Of course . This is my job .
A :  Yeah ? Was it a nice way to create your remote control ?
C :  Yeah , it's uh
C :  it's good , to
C :  to create a control instead of a computer .
B :  Yeah , I think I find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end .
B :  And designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And for the marketing guy ?
D :  Uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . 'Cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff
B :  Yep .
D :  next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay , okay .
A :  And new ideas about new products , maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh
A :  and yellow .
B :  Yellow . I think you can think about a yellow T_V_ now after a fruit T_V_ or I dunno . It can be an interesting I don't know
A :  Yes , just lemon .
B :  Yeah , just a lemon T_V_ it'd be yellow lemon .
C :  Yeah , but y you know the traditional T_V_ it's um
B :  It's flat , uh
C :  Yeah yeah it's flat , yeah the shape is very boring . Could we come up with new T_V_ with such as this kind of T_V_ ? So you can you have base , triangle base so you the T_V_ you can
A :  Squared ?
B :  Yeah , that's right . It's really boring , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Ah , the lemon T_V_ with the pineapple remote control .
B :  Yeah , that's that would be really interesting , actually .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Because the T_V_ you also
A :  Oh , that's interesting . You could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . Electronic device .
B :  Device devi
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . 'Cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . Maybe two years it's dead .
C :  Yeah .
B :  The fruit ? Yeah .
A :  Maybe
A :  Yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects .
B :  Yeah , it's
D :  Yeah .
B :  But I think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product .
B :  Yeah .
D :  T_V_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so .
D :  If you have a lemon lemon T_V_ for
B :  Yeah , yeah . That's a yeah , yeah .
B :  We can think about T_V_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know .
D :  fifteen years
A :  Customable T_V_ .
B :  Yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep
D :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Ah such yeah . You've already said mobile phones . Yeah , and following
D :  Tha that would that would make it . Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , you can keep the global appearan
B :  The mood of persons , the fashions uh
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  We int
A :  It's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh T_V_ with uh a a tr
B :  Yeah , T_V_ , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  A T_V_ for autumn and a T_V_ for winter , you know , so it's
C :  Yeah .
B :  So what i and do w is it Okay .
A :  So I think the costs are within the budget . We're just at twelve fifty Euros . So do you think you can celebrate your creation ?
B :  Yeah , the pr at
C :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
C :  And you can celebrate your leadership .
A :  Oh , thanks a lot . Thank you , mister David Jordan .
B :  Yeah but I think f it's really a celebrating object . So it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy , so . Uh it's it's a pr it's like yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah . It's party party remote control .
A :  The thing now is to to sell it .
C :  Yeah , it's your job . Sell it . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , right , go and sell it . Goo and good luck , so
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve
D :  Uh-huh . Twenty five Euros . Yeah , I think it's
C :  Twenty five Euros , yeah . Twenty five Euros . No , it's not so expensive .
B :  It should be fine .
A :  It's maybe a little bit expensive .
D :  It's cheap , yeah .
D :  No , I
D :  I'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know .
B :  Wh really ? It should be it should be fine , you know , actually . S
C :  Okay .
A :  Maybe what you can do a test . Put it outside , and if bees come , it's really fruit .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  I I think I like the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so
A :  But don't put sugar in it , it's not working .
D :  No , the colours are uh it's perfect , yeah .
B :  It's perfect , and
D :  True . Uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still .
B :  I p is th y the the yellow ball thing that
A :  Yeah , but the colour , I think the colour is more is most important , because I I don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control .
D :  Uh
D :  Still that was one of the requirements we had . It's yeah but it I don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere .
B :  Uh f like y we can we can put some uh double R_
A :  Yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double R_ .
D :  Mm .
B :  Okay yeah , yeah . That's actually good idea , so
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  So we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , so we have the slogan too .
C :  So we have to give a
C :  So we have give him give it a cute name .
D :  Cute na
A :  Yeah th no , it's the it's the pineapple control remote control . It's a pineapple now , it has changed . It's a pineapple . Pineapple .
C :  Mush mushroom controller .
D :  You cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . It's not the trend .
B :  It's not a mushroom . It's a pineapple remote controls .
C :  Pine apple .
B :  Yeah , pineapple remote remote control .
D :  Yeah , but just flying saucer , or
A :  With cherry on top .
B :  Oh , that
C :  Okay .
D :  I would say flying saucer .
B :  Oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so
D :  It's more appropriate , somehow .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  That's that's pineapple remote control . I think it's fine .
D :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
A :  Will you buy one ?
B :  Yeah . Yeah I will try I'll try . I can hel I will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage
A :  Try to . Okay uh
C :  Twenty five Euro .
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your T_V_ so so you need to buy one .
B :  Yeah I always lose my Yeah , so so i if it is a universal one I can use it with my T_V_ , so it would be
C :  Okay .
A :  One thing I like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket .
D :  Mm .
C :  Traditional one ? Yeah .
C :  So this one and this one . What do you choose ? What do you choose ?
A :  I prefer the laser remote control . No .
B :  I think I would choose this one because of the colour . It's
C :  Okay .
B :  it's will enlight your house , your home and your T_V_ , so .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Oh . Maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside .
B :  Yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea .
D :  Yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . We had some problems going to twelve Euros and uh I dunno .
A :  Yeah .
B :  .
A :  I think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah .
D :  Yeah , afterwards , if
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  if it's a new trend .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah that's that fine . So we can celebrate now . That's our new product .
A :  So
A :  Champagne , mister Baba .
D :  We should celebrate .
B :  Yes . It's it's fine . It's
B :  I like it .
B :  Next time . Well , I'll buy one here .
C :  So buy one .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So
D :  Mm .
A :  Okay , I will close this . Mm .
B :  Yeah . No ?
A :  So I think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  and we have a nearly final product .
D :  Our final prototype which yeah .
B :  Final prototype , yeah , ye yeah .
A :  Final prototype , right . So , thank you very much . Very productive .
C :  Prototype , yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay . Thanks .
B :  S so who is going to take the remote control ?
A :  Okay . Good afternoon again .
A :  So we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . Um So here is the agenda for today . Uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , sounds interesting . And we'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our Marketing Experts . Then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh Euro . Okay . So let's go . Uh if I go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting .
A :  So we went through th uh w we took this following decisions .
A :  No L_C_D_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . We went through the use of wheels and but buttons . And also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . Okay . Um . Good .
A :  So guys
A :  let this uh wonderful thing .
C :  Okay so we can go to the slides . Yeah .
A :  Oh yeah . Sorry . Um .
C :  Number three . Oh number two sorry .
A :  Which is
C :  So final design . Final design .
C :  Okay so
C :  Michael you can go ahead .
B :  Yeah so uh following our decision to uh
B :  make a yellow well to make a banana
A :  Yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe .
B :  remote okay so
B :  we actually have a
C :  You can pull it out first , maybe .
B :  We've well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  bana sit the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over and um this is the remote itself , it's kind of it's it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . We've got the two uh
B :  uh scroll wheels here which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally .
A :  What's the use uh of the t turbo button already ?
B :  This is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th
A :  Ah yeah yeah an then you stop when you stop it stops .
B :  Yeah . Well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . But normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture .
C :  Uh
A :  Uh-huh .
C :  And we we do have one more functionality . If you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the T_V_ .
B :  The T_V_ yeah . The s the turbo button . So rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button .
A :  Which one ?
C :  The turbo button .
A :  Okay .
C :  Additional button .
D :  What this button for ?
B :  This is a teletext button . So once you press that then you get teletext and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh
D :  Okay .
D :  But if you want to go to page seven hundred ?
A :  To navigate it through th through teletext .
B :  To navigate yeah .
C :  That's right , that's right .
B :  Yeah .
A :  with the wheel it's easy .
D :  How man
B :  Well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing , you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then
B :  zero zero and then you can uh
D :  I don't understand it . Can you repeat it ?
B :  Well you can you can press press the teletext button and then you then you can you can f
C :  So then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing .
D :  Yeah .
C :  And you can tele yeah , once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume . Yeah .
D :  Ah okay okay . Okay . Okay okay .
B :  Mm uh
D :  Okay .
D :  I see . I see . Okay . Okay .
B :  And this is the uh the infrared uh port .
C :  That's right .
B :  Also the top of the banana . So . And then we have in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Excellent .
A :  Calling .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Excellent . And the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ?
B :  Actually they do . That's that's yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object .
A :  Oh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage . It's like antennas .
B :  Yeah . So .
B :  But yeah that's um that's just like that's an attractive um base station .
A :  Great .
B :  So .
A :  So , what else ?
B :  Okay .
C :  And for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries .
D :  Is it really weight ? Is it light or
C :  It is very light .
A :  Yeah , they're light .
D :  Okay .
B :  It's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana .
D :  Okay .
B :  You know , to give you the correct look and feel .
C :  Yeah . And we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana . Otherwise it's you know a child comes and so
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah , I see . I under I understand .
B :  I think a child would try to eat it anyway , so maybe we should
C :  Yeah .
B :  consider that . maybe health and safety aspects .
A :  Ah yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Oh we didn't think of that yet . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So for the power source , apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries .
C :  Oh yeah that's right .
A :  Uh you mean okay . So
B :  I don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station .
A :  Yeah , where are going to where are you are you going to place them ?
C :  Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
C :  It'll It'll be always at top somewhere at there .
B :  If I was gonna place them I'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit but yeah I don't I really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore .
A :  You have enough surface ? You
C :  Yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries so that that is .
A :  Okay . What will be the autonomy ? Roughly ?
B :  Mm .
B :  The what sorry ?
A :  The autonomy .
A :  Autonomy .
B :  What do you mean ?
D :  How long the how long the bit the batteries long .
A :  Uh I mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ?
B :  Ah .
B :  Ah .
B :  A long time .
A :  Yeah . A long
B :  No no no , it can it should be weeks .
C :  Eight to ten eight to ten hours .
C :  N most no most of the time it's not being used .
A :  Yeah , so it's
B :  Yeah but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so
C :  So when when you are making it on
A :  It's used only when you
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm . No eight or eight or ten hours of working . If you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer .
B :  Ah , okay . Okay .
A :  Yeah . F weeks .
C :  Yeah . That's right .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
A :  Next slide ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  And we are having the speakers regular chip for control . Pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip .
C :  And uh that's it .
A :  Okay . Okay . Those really sounds very good . Nothing else to add ?
C :  That's right .
B :  It seems to be falling over .
D :  I l yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I like I like it . Maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons . Looks a bit
C :  You want to have more functional buttons ?
D :  Looks a bit puzzled uh I dunno how to say that . You the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not
C :  You are not convinced .
C :  Not not many , we we want to keep it simple . So that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons .
D :  And the volume button will will become
C :  It's up to you , means . Now that
A :  Well in fact b both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext .
C :  Means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits .
B :  Or can move between positions in the in the number .
C :  That's right .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And what about people who want to use digits ? Butto real buttons ?
C :  Yeah . So there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape .
A :  Wow .
C :  So we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they they don't care about the buttons any more .
D :  Okay . Because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff ?
C :  And anyway
B :  It's all automatic .
D :  It's all automatic . Okay . Okay yeah it's fine . W we are living in a wonderful world .
B :  Yep .
A :  Very good uh yeah you th yeah . Bananas everywhere . Okay , so
B :  Uh .
D :  Automatically configure .
A :  So we have to go through now evaluations .
C :  Evalua yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So your slides are ready ?
A :  Uh you're four I think . So this is one , which one is this one ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . I I const I constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . And each criteria is will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria so we must
D :  users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven .
C :  Why this strange factor of seven ?
D :  Because i
D :  I'm sorry . Sorry .
C :  Usually I have seen that scales are from one to ten .
D :  Ah yeah . It's from sorry , it's from one to seven . It's from from one to seven sorry . Because it should be an even
D :  it should be an even uh scale , and five
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay . Mm-hmm .
A :  Num number
D :  is too short and nine is too long .
C :  Okay .
D :  I'm a I I'm
C :  Okay fine , got the idea .
A :  So to have in order to have enough granularity it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation .
D :  Sorry ?
D :  Yeah yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  The variance is mi it's is minimal . I'm um answering your question . Okay . And that's the criteria I I found more useful . I think I sh I I could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ? And we all four could range
A :  Okay .
C :  Okay , okay , great .
C :  Okay . Yeah yeah . Go ahead .
C :  Mm-hmm . Sure .
C :  Okay . Yeah yeah . Yeah .
D :  could evaluate the
A :  Okay .
C :  So you can say fancy ,
C :  handy .
C :  Handy .
D :  Okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or
C :  Yeah , it's fancy , according to me .
D :  Seven but
A :  Yeah , six .
C :  Seven . Seven by me .
A :  S seven . Six .
D :  I would say seven . It's quite fancy .
C :  Okay .
C :  So you can add seven plus six plus seven plus
A :  No , wait . What do you say seven ? Five ?
B :  Yeah uh five .
C :  Five .
B :  Five , maybe maybe maybe six it's it's I guess it's yeah .
A :  Okay , six point five .
A :  Handy ?
C :  Again I'll give seven .
B :  I'd give it a six like I'd I think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason but you know you can always use your other
A :  Seven .
D :  Six .
C :  Yep .
B :  remote .
A :  So seven , seven , six ,
C :  Seven for me .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Six .
A :  six point five .
A :  Functional .
A : 
C :  I'll give five .
D :  I would say
A :  Four .
B :  Well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ?
D :  Everything ar
A :  Uh for a remote control , does he have all the
D :  Mm everything
B :  You know .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  It's compared to the all
A :  you could expect .
C :  That's right . That's right .
D :  remote controls .
B :  That's before
C :  The standards . What is available in the market off the shelf .
B :  Yeah . I have to say four .
D :  Actually I don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro
B :  Well it's not a universal remote . Remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on T_V_s .
C :  We
D :  Ah it's not an univer but it's for all kind of T_V_s ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Well all T_V_s but only T_ only T_V_s I guess .
A :  So it's universal but for T_V_s .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So s uh four ?
C :  Five .
A :  Five ? Four .
B :  Four .
D :  Four . Four .
C :  So four point two ? four .
B :  Just four . Obviously there are some outliers so
A :  Four .
D :  So four ?
A :  Okay cool ? Cool device .
C :  There I'll give it seven .
D :  It means cool features , like
D :  new features actually .
C :  That's right .
B :  Which
C :  For a T_V_ the most important feature which I felt was the locator which is a cool feature . And then the scroll buttons are again cool features . We don't have L_C_D_ for it but
C :  that we decided we don't want to have .
A :  Yeah . Seven .
D :  I would say five .
B :  I'll say five .
C :  Mm-hmm . Seven .
A :  Six .
A :  Plus six , I say I said seven . So it's six . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  You said seven ?
B :  S yeah .
B :  'Cause it's five five seven seven so
C :  Okay .
B :  Uh , okay , definitely easy to use .
C :  Definitely seven .
B :  Seven .
A :  Seven .
A :  Seven . And you ?
A :  Outl you are not lik outlier . Seven
D :  Five .
A :  Okay okay okay okay .
C :  Okay .
D :  Sorry , I have them
B :  Alright , now here's the sixty million Dollar question , well , twenty five twenty five Euro question .
A :  Of course I'll buy the banana .
B :  What do you what do you guys reckon ?
D :  Of cour Of course the most difficult question for the end .
C :  I'll say five .
A :  Well
B :  Hmm .
C :  I'll say five .
A :  Twenty five Euros .
A :  Cheap .
D :  I find it quite cheap actually . I dunno . If i i it depends , if you live in in Switzerland or you live in
A :  Yeah , so the target price is for all Europe , or only for rich countries ? It's more targeting U_K_ or
D :  I don't know . Wha the initial specifications were for the whole all Europe or
B :  Uh
A :  So this is selling costs , not production costs .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah this is the the initial specifications .
A :  Yeah yeah sure . Um
A :  Five .
D :  I would say six . It's quite cheap actually .
B :  I'd say two . I don't want a banana on my living room table , a banana remote .
C :  Why ?
A :  Aw , should be nice in your
C :  No but it's really handy actually if you see . It's it's so handy . And then
B :  It is handy , it's handy , but it it's terrible . Yeah .
A :  It's kitsch .
C :  Anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this .
B :  Yeah , but it's not a positive thing .
C :  It's a very positive thing if you see like that .
B :  Well , you know , it's it's handy , it's ergonomic , but it's a banana .
A :  Well , don't forget well , don't for don't forget who we're targeting also who are f f who are wh yeah , youngst youngst
C :  Youngsters .
D :  Actually maybe
B :  Yeah but it says I , I would buy this , so .
A :  No well yeah I if you would be young .
D :  Yeah
A :  Not telling that you are young . Li li like a teenager for instance .
B :  No , it's I . I would buy
A :  Okay you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things . Yeah .
C :  You want to flaunt . You with your girlfriend or something .
A :  Yeah , you want to show the beautiful banana you have .
B :  S s
C :  Or might be it does some other kind of thing but
B :  Still I I'd say two . I don't think I at any stage in my life I would want a banana remote control , really .
C :  Uh yeah , crazy .
A :  Okay so you s you give oh yeah yeah I know I know . So you say two . F I d I say five .
B :  I can say , maybe there is a market for it , I dunno . Yeah .
C :  I say five .
A :  You say ?
D :  I change the question .
A :  So what's the new question ?
C :  And you have saved it ?
D :  So yeah upload the
C :  You'll have to reload .
A :  Uh yeah , I think so .
B :  Okay , so , it depends if uh
D :  Yeah it's two different situations . If you really need an universal remote control or if you
D :  would change your remote control for a n for a new one .
A :  Yeah that's two different question .
B :  If I had t if I had to spend twenty five Euro ,
B :  if that was like my limit , maybe I would buy it . Because the other twenty five Euro remote controls are probably gonna look
C :  They're not going to be as
A :  Ugly .
B :  worse than a banana .
C :  And they they might not be a as easy as this yeah .
B :  And it yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So ? What now ? What range ?
A :  I stick to five .
C :  I go slightly up . Six .
B :  Although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning so I dunno . Um .
D :  Six .
A :  W we have six , five
B :  I'd give it I'd give it a
A :  Three So we are
B :  I give it a four now .
D :  Six ? Six ?
C :  Six , five , four .
A :  six , five , four
D :  Six , so it's uh five point five , or less .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So
C :  Okay .
A :  So and last question , will I change my rem change my remote control from Mando banana .
A :  Um , zero . No uh we can't . So one .
D :  Actually yeah , I we
A :  Well if .
B :  Yeah .
A :  No uh let's say I'll put two .
B :  I'd say three , I mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible . If it was change my remote control of my D_V_D_ player for a Mando banana then I would be more inclined to but uh 'cause it's really bad but uh I'd say a three .
A :  It's for the T_V_ .
C :  I'll still give it five .
D :  Five ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Two three five two three fi and two . So it's r
D :  You are romantic , really . I would say two .
C :  So it's somewhere three point five I think .
A :  Yeah , three point five .
D :  Who is the outlier ? Wh wh you said five ?
A :  No no you say five , he is the outlier .
C :  No I said five .
A :  Okay just just do a sum .
D :  I don't know if it's a
B :  It's not very promising but you know
B :  we're not young trendsetters .
D :  No because there are more yeah , we shouldn't sum like that .
A :  Well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob
D :  Because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually . Otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up ?
D :  Uh no I didn't anything .
B :  Well just leave it at that then .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Oops .
D :  Yeah , the uh
A :  So maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . We can had uh have a out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Problem with connectors ?
D :  Do you want me to sum o I think it's not
C :  Yeah it's it's funny .
B :  No . I think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it , so .
A :  Okay . So let's move uh let's move on . Okay , now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay . So I prepare an Excel sh uh an Excel sheet . Um well we are going to calculate the production costs . We should we should be below twelve point five .
C :  Yeah , sure .
A :  So I already uh put some pu some numbers here , okay . We are going to go through so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing . So it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about . Uh and also things that I uh I d I forget to uh to put like solar cells .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well we decided against the solar cells so
A :  Oh yeah finally we say no . Okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines . So hand dynamo . This something we didn't thought about .
C :  Solar cells , yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah , we said no to that .
B :  You mean , charging it by shaking the banana .
A :  But
A :  Yeah .
C :  I think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing . Yeah . To bring the cost
A :  Yeah . Okay so we we stick to battery , one .
C :  Yeah .
A :  No kinetic also . I don't I don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo .
B :  Well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually
A :  Ah you have to ah okay I see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana . Crazy . Okay . So those banana is falling .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Let's go ahead . So we we st only have one for battery . Uh then for electronics um so I didn't put anything for the .
C :  So we have the regular chip on the print , which is one .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  And that's it .
A :  Okay . No so we hin
C :  And we have sample speaker . Yeah . Yeah . the cost of that is very high .
A :  Yeah so one . Ooh ye ye ye the cost is increasing . So we are
B :  Well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that , we're just using the the very beep simple beep , that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything . So
A :  The beep .
C :  Uh-huh .
A :  That's what
C :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay so I'll remove it .
B :  Yeah . I say that
B :  Yeah .
C :  And we have sev
A :  So don't we need a
A :  Oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing . So
C :  Yeah . So we we'll put some extras , if there is something .
A :  Yeah maybe . We'll see later . Okay so in for the case um
B :  Mm .
A :  I put single curved .
C :  Okay . To reduce the cost , it's okay .
B :  Well , wait a second , no , it's it's double curved , it's got a c , it's uh
A :  Because we have two things .
C :  Oh it's got all the directions so don't worry .
A :  No .
B :  Well d yeah it's monotonic but
C :  It's got a direction .
B :  it's got but if you hold it
B :  if you hold it that way that's two curved ,
B :  one on this side , one on that side , but they're opposite sides .
A :  Well .
D :  Actually what's the differen
A :  What a what i if I put one here .
B :  This is actually I mean this probably
B :  this probably actually costs more than three if you
A :  Yeah so let's put one here in the then instead of single oka all right . So we stick to plastic , it cost nothing .
C :  Okay . Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . That's right .
B :  Well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber
A :  No , it's too no .
D :  Too expensive .
B :  if you drop it ?
A :  It's too expensive .
B :  Well when okay . Well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in .
A :  We're already at eleven .
A :  Okay so I put rubber one .
A :  Okay so special colour , yellow . Uh for the interface we have
B :  Yeah .
C :  We don't have any push buttons .
B :  No , we have two push buttons .
A :  We have three .
C :  No that is a scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that .
B :  Huh .
A :  No no . We have two scroll , and we have three push buttons .
C :  Ah okay , okay .
B :  Uh .
C :  Okay , okay .
B :  Okay it's gonna have to be plastic .
D :  Actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here .
A :  And
A :  No it's no chip . This is just radio frequency . Th This is no chip .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but
C :  No . There's no chip there . It just emits the signal . And the receiver accepts it and that's it .
D :  you need
A :  It's just
A :  Yeah .
D :  Fo i it does nothing actually ?
A :  No . Just only .
C :  Just se sends the signal , that's it .
B :  It's a recharger thing and uh
A :  Okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons .
B :  Well I actually did um
B :  think about it myself but I thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button but you know the turbo button does add that extra class .
A :  Yeah , so
A :  Yeah .
B :  You know . So I mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that .
A :  Okay . So no L_C_D_ ,
A :  so for we have no button supplements , right ?
C :  Yep . No .
A :  Uh
A :  well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement because oh no , these are these are for colours , co and special forms , special colours and special materials . So
B :  Yeah .
B :  No we're not we don't need anything special for the buttons .
A :  Okay so we are over budget .
C :  Yeah . So first thing which we should take care of is ,
B :  Make it plastic instead of rubber . And then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents .
C :  instead of rubber , let it be plastic .
A :  Yeah .
C :  And uh that much money will be required for the base station , which is not there .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So mayb in fact n we have to put two here
A :  because it cost nothing .
B :  Yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic .
C :  Yeah .
C :  That's right . So might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go
A :  Exactly exactly so we have margin for that stuff .
B :  Does that include charging circuitry and everything ?
C :  That's right .
A :  Yeah maybe .
A :  Okay good .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Excellent .
B :  So what do we do with the extra profits ?
A :  Um we'll invest in R_ and D_ .
B :  Okay . The next fruit .
A :  Yeah . So well we're under the the the cost . So we can go to through to project evaluation .
D :  Okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy . Would yeah , would buy .
B :  No we have a product which none of us would buy .
A :  Sorry ?
D :  Yeah because th th the evaluation project
A :  Which is different . Which is different . None of us will buy it .
B :  No it's people in in in Milan and uh in Paris that are gonna buy it . We're n yeah . We're not in Milan or Paris .
D :  Ah would buy , yeah . Massively , yeah .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  Uh you have been in Milan a couple of times , so . And you said the lowest .
B :  Actually there were a lot of
A :  This is a battery .
A :  This is what we which you can mm
C :  Detachable battery .
B :  That's 'cause I'm sick of Milan .
A :  It did yeah .
D :  Yeah , for the batteries
A :  Extra battery , yeah .
B :  Okay so um project process .
A :  Well in fact I I did not know I didn't know really what to say here . If uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say . So
A :  I don't I don't I don't understand what
A :  what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example .
A :  Should it be more like um like a status of
A :  of the these meetings in fact .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much .
B :  I dunno I think we had a fair bit of creativity .
A :  Oh yeah it's really creative .
B :  And uh but I think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting . We needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they
A :  Yeah .
C :  They like that .
B :  see if they like it .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation .
B :  Because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of
C :  Biased .
B :  pointless .
A :  So maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation
A :  in the streets like asking to young peoples well , do you like to have a banana as a remote control .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well , to see you know how to how to market this thing .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  'Cause you know if well I mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a T_V_ for each kid , then you know , banana remote control could be fun for them as well . Might have to draw a face on it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So but I think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target
B :  market .
A :  Yep .
A :  Any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time ? Dunno , oranges ?
C :  Yeah . The cost of the thing can be made more than might be . Because I think it's just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to .
B :  Yeah . I think there are ways we could maybe simplify the
C :  Interface .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside , I'm not sure really how complicated our um
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  our needs are . I mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers , do we really need an integrated circuit to
A :  Hmm .
B :  you know to process that .
C :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
D :  So more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on T_V_ .
C :  That's right .
D :  The complexity shouldn't be much higher .
C :  Yeah .
D :  For you said if it good for D_V_D_ then I would
B :  And also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff , that would be rather cool . I think that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the T_V_ and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room .
C :  Integrate .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . Very good .
C :  So
A :  So
C :  What else ?
A :  Well done . I think we we can go
C :  Okay .
C :  Home ? Happily satisfied .
A :  home . Yeah . Maybe maybe we can hassle the the
A :  production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay so thanks very much . Bye .
B :  Yep .
C :  Thank you .
B :  Okay . Thank you .
D :  Bye .
A :  Mm .
D :  So , Hi Christa .
A :  So , uh now it's the Hi Sammy . It's the detail design meeting , so we're going last meeting . So um , first uh Mark and Rama are going to present uh the prototype . Uh then uh Sammy will propose some uh crite cr criteria to evaluate this prototype . Then , w we
D :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
A :  And then we going to do some finance to see if uh it is uh feasible and uh at the end we will we will um evaluate ourself as a team . And that's all . Okay . So first , let's uh
B :  And chocolate ?
D :  Mm .
A :  see the prototype .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , here we have our prototype model .
A :  Okay . And you have some slides then ? Yeah . Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , we have also some slides .
B :  Yes , and place some slides .
A :  Okay . Uh so in which uh
C :  In
B :  Uh , participant three .
B :  Prototype .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm okay . Mm .
C :  Five .
B :  Uh , so
C :  Him .
B :  this is our
B :  remote control .
B :  It's a r working prototype . You can use it now by switching all these buttons . So first , I present as we came to this perfect model , and then we'll give some technical specifications . That's well , so that's that . Please , next slide .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We analysed all the fruits and contacted NASA , and uh made some real good Yeah . If you can see this , and the stars are showing that . And um ,
A :  MASA ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  s society will accept that . For sure .
B :  And making some analysis of different fruits , we choose the ultimate form , ultimate colours , and uh ultimate smell of it . S please , next slide .
B :  But we still didn't want to go far from our titanium idea , 'cause it's the most of the moder the m
B :  the modern material we can p select .
B :  And it's practical .
B :  And it's still say it's for our needs , so please press something .
B :  And as I said , it's perfect .
C :  .
A :  Okay .
B :  Please press it . Everyone is f really uh really glad to obtain an
C :  Experience . Explanat
D :  Such a nice thing .
B :  s such a r such a device . So you can touch it with your hands . Sure . Yes .
C :  See this .
D :  Can I ? Ho-ho .
C :  You can
D : 
A :  What do you say ?
D :  It says
B :  You must say it .
C :  Spongy .
D :  I will uh
A :  One day . He
D :  I'll buy it . If I if I need so . Hopefully my daughter will like it .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Y and we got the answer . Uh , it is , yes , of course . , please next slide . Um , this is a prototype . You can have a look at it , and
D :  Yes , of course . Of c course .
D :  Ah .
B :  That's all I wanted to say . Now it's technical specification by our
C :  Hmm .
B :  colleague .
A :  Hmm .
C :  So
D :  Oh , there is a button missing . Okay . It's in option .
C :  Yeah . This this is really flexible . You can add your buttons . Yeah . So function , mm
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So , as we discussed , we have to switch on switch off whenever we want . And so , we have buttons and using L_C_D_ , or like you can use this jog wheel and select which ever option on the L_C_D_ , and then do on and off . Then you ha you'll have volume control . So , you you can press these buttons to increase or decrease the volume .
C :  And we have some L_C_D_ controls . Like , m switching the L_C_D_ display if you want to use L_C_D_ , or you don't want you can just use normal button . And we have speech recognition . Here you have microphone , and then it date records your voice , and then it try to recognise . And it can also do the action .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Hmm .
C :  And location finder . And we want to do the location basically using speech recogniser . You can just say , where is my remote control . Or uh , you can just give some nickname to your remote control , like Bobby . And then , it will say hi .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Hey , babe . Bob . Hey Bob .
A :  Bobby . Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , hi , and then you can use it .
D :  Okay , that's good .
A :  Hmm . 'Kay .
C :  So , um our team is now fruits . Mainly strawberry . So , you can have And then you can see the look L_C_D_ and all the switches .
A : 
D :  Oh , these are strawberries .
A :  Are colourful . Yeah .
C :  Material , we want to stick to titanium .
C :  We will send , we want to
D :  Fruit smelling spongy titanium . I didn't know it exist , but that's great .
A : 
C :  Yeah , or s
C :  So , we want to have simple and perfect shapes , like I shown in these phones . You can have your own designs and and you can feel simple designs . And you can choose colours on your day for each day , or even many colours .
D :  Ha .
A :  Ho-ho .
D :  You mean we can change the colour uh of th
A :  That's for the L_C_D_ or for the titanium ?
C :  For the L_C_D_ .
D :  Yeah . Yeah okay , for the L_C_D_ .
C :  With titanium it's it is silver . Yeah .
D :  Tit titanium is
B :  We are still working on titanium . So , r we'll start with L_C_D_ . You can ask Bob . It's Tuesday .
A :  Mm-mm .
D :  Uh , okay .
C :  Mm , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , Bob , please . Tuesday colour .
A :  Hey , you know you're theme today .
C :  Yeah . Even you can configure your colours for its the depending on your mood , or s
D :  Okay .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Black for Sunday .
C :  And you can have many colours on weekends . Or
A :  And w wait , wh what are the strawberries for ?
D :  On the L_C_D_ ? Oh .
C :  Huh ?
A :  Wh wh
C :  Ah , these are like sensors .
D :  Of course . What do you think ? Strawberry sensors .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  That's location sensors .
D :  Very useful .
A :  Okay . Strawberries .
C :  So , after this meeting we'll propose a party for our success for
A :  Ah .
D :  Lounge meeting .
C :  So , if you are vegetarian or you have any options , please let us know .
B :  Yeah , and we can just some strawberry first . Um
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright . Good .
A :  Okay . Mm-hmm .
B :  Oops .
D :  So , huh . Interesting . In interesting . Mm mm .
C :  So , any specific questions for
A :  Uh we'll see in the financial part if uh all gets into
D :  It makes sense .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Let's make a party first maybe .
C :  Yeah . Then we can discuss We can
A :  W
A :  Who is the five uh fifty millions we first make a party in ?
C :  Yeah , then we can have how much for how money is left .
D :  So uh , this is
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay . Uh , so
D :  What a design .
D :  It's my turn . Mm-hmm . Let's see if this Yeah , if you meet
A :  Let's uh , yeah , let's see if uh th it's meet the evaluation criterium .
C :  Yeah .
D :  the evaluation criterion .
A :  Oops .
C :  Fudge .
D :  Yeah . So , evaluation please .
D :  So . You made a very nice prototype , and um , I think , we now need altogether to try to evaluate it to see if it makes sense to do it , if it fulfils our what we want to do , and things like that . So mm
D :  Uh , next slide , please .
D :  As you know , before going and uh creating and producing these strawberry uh remote control , it's very important to first verify if it makes sense , if we have a chance to sell it . Uh , so we need to evaluate it um , try to do it in a constative way , and as much as we can .
C :  Yeah .
D :  To so what I propose is that we are going to to have this scale from one to seven . One meaning that , ye yes uh it fulfils uh the the criterion , whatever it is . And seven meaning , no it doesn't fulfil at all . And we're all l going to list all the criterion . I'm going to go to that next slide , and together try to evaluate this according to this criterion and from one to seven . And then we are just going to have an average , which will give us the value of our uh remote control . So , maybe we can have a look at the criteria ?
A :  Okay .
C :  Fancy .
D :  So these are the criterion uh I'm I thought were important . Of course , this can be discussed , but let's let's see , so let's vote . So we have fancy here and we have the scale
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  from one to seven
D :  with four in the middle .
C :  Huh .
D :  So ,
C :  Yeah , what's is really
D :  what do you think , is it fancy ?
C :  Uh , it's really
A :  Uh , I think that fancy , we can say it is fancy .
D :  It is very very fancy . Or have you ever seen something like that ?
A :  Oh . I am not the d the only one choosing , yeah . Uh what do you think ?
D :  Yeah , of course . What do you think ?
B :  Feel the weight .
D :  Is it
D :  The weight is later . Now we're We're on the fanciness now . I think it's quite fancy .
C :  Yeah . Oh .
B :  Really .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , yeah . We can give at least five or six , seven .
D :  It's uh
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , so No it's it's one . Yeah , o one means it's , yes , a very fancy and seven mean no at all . So it's one or two . What do you think ? Two ? Okay . So here , two . Up . Then we have uh technology .
A :  It's in the other . Yeah .
C :  Oh , Oh . So Oh , okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , okay . Oh , okay . So
A :  Two . Let's say two , yeah .
C :  M maybe two .
B :  Two . Two .
C :  Technology .
C :  Yeah . Um
D :  So , what about technology ? We have uh we have speech recognition , we have location based , we have L_C_D_ .
C :  And we have L_C_D_ .
C :  So you change colours .
A :  Change colour of t
D :  Change colour , I mean that's very
C :  Useful .
A :  Yeah , I think it's a
D :  Quite d I think it's a one for that , at least . At least a one , yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Uh
C :  Yeah , yeah . It's silly .
A :  Mm-mm .
D :  Robustness , uh-huh .
C :  Uh , still we need to cha
D :  So let's suppose my daughter take it and um and through it away . Do you think it makes sense that it's going to live again ? Uh , maybe not the prototype . Let's try .
A : 
A :  Um
A :  The strawberries Oh .
C :  Yeah , it Maybe strawberry .
D :  Oh my god . Okay , we just lost one strawberry . So Not at all ?
B :  No . No . How can I say this . It's still it's still working , and your daughter got a bonus . A strawberry .
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah , we can easily plug it .
D :  It is
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  So it's not so bad . I um uh I would say three .
A :  Mm-mm .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah . But it's too . It's um robust , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that does make sense , yeah ?
C :  Useful ?
D :  Useful . Well , so the question is does it have uh the minimum requirement of re remote control ? So I don't know . These buttons are uh It not clear . But you have at least uh next produce .
C :  Yeah ,
A :  Oh , yeah , lets me try .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  What is uh next , please ?
C :  Yeah , channel . I this is volume control and channel changes . These are the main
D :  Uh , it depends on the Okay .
A :  And you can uh do di two sites ? Yeah .
C :  You
C :  Yeah . Yeah , and you can do on L_C_D_ using these going to scrolling all the option . So if you don't want
A :  Okay , also .
D :  So but , for instance , because the L_C_D_ is not uh touch control , touch screen , you cannot go to channel twenty five directly .
C :  Yeah , um yeah .
A :  You can , by using the
C :  Yeah .
B :  You can .
D :  Directly .
B :  You go you So , the basic mode Yeah . So that's simple . The basic mode is uh you got just two buttons and a jog dial . With two buttons , you do this like uh volume up , volume down . Or if you go to the site , it's channel up channel down . And if you want to make to s twenty-five , you push on this .
A :  You c push here the the yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Oh , it's a jog dial , okay .
D :  Uh-huh .
C :  And channel .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  You can select .
B :  You select twenty , you select five . That's it .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah mm .
D :  It's much longer than that that being two two five , no ? Don't you think so ? May not okay , we can go . That's uh You're right .
B :  No .
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Y you need to like press two and five and Yeah .
D :  That's it's less uh Yeah . But it's it's nice , because people anyway don't go there . But
C :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah mm .
D :  So what do you think for it , usefulness ? Seems to be useful .
C :  So , d Yeah , we need to address we want we only address two main functions here and the other functions will be on L_C_D_ . So
A :  Let me understand well , because I'm not sure that's for that this one are b d uh two dir directional button . Yeah , two
C :  so
D :  Both .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Up down or left right . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Up .
A :  Yeah . And which what is that ?
D :  That
B :  It's a jog dial for controlling the cursor on the L_C_D_ screen . Like , selecting the menus .
C :  This is jog wheel .
A :  Okay , okay . It's a kind Oh , okay okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Um , see in L_C_D_ , like you will have blocks and you select which one .
D :  Cool .
A :  Oh oh okay , great .
D :  I would say then uh
A :  Now it's looks us useful . Yeah .
D :  Two or three ? Two or three ? Two .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Two , maybe .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , two .
D :  So size and weight .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Is it the the the effective size and weight that the Is it uh real size , real weight ? Or Because it Size is going to be that , yeah ?
C :  Yeah , it's size al almost
C :  Yeah , because it is The weight will be bit lighter . We will s We use titanium . Yeah .
D :  Uh , and and
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  Sure , without titanium alloy , it's going to be light .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  It's going to be lighter , because this seems to be very heavy f I mean , for my daughter , for instance . Not sure if uh she can use it .
B :  Of course .
C :  Heavy . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But sides uh , the sides should be okay . . Yeah mm .
D :  So , should be okay .
D :  Up to three for that , because I'm haven't seen the weight so I must not uh Colour and shape .
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Oh .
A :  Uh-oh .
D :  Well , so colour , it seems that we have the several colours for the L_C_D_ . But um , it's not very clear what is the colour of the sh the sh the case . It's a it's going to be titanium . Okay , okay . That's nice . I think it's good . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  The case is silver titanium , no ?
A :  Yeah , it's .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Let's imagine .
A :  And what about the strawberries on the top ? I'm not convince . But maybe I'm not trendy . But , uh
D :  Yahoo .
D :  Well y you know , it's this uh fruit and vegetable year . So
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but uh uh they're not useful . I I mean it that's uh
C :  So maybe , I think
D :  Uh , I think usefulness is m as as I rem um just have to remind you that usefulness is much less important than fanciness . Whether it's fancy or not now , it we have to decide . But this If it's
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah , well
C :  Yeah . Um
A :  Hmm .
A :  I would have m uh i found more fancy that the fruits are useful .
D :  Uh-huh . So , that they will that maybe the fruit may be here instead .
A :  Yeah .
D :  .
C :  Yeah , well then it's bit difficult to use . Not like this d We're just giving the fruit for more fanciness and more attraction , too . So , maybe think we can have rubber or some sponges , stuff for strawberries and different colours . So it's Even
A :  Mm-hmm . But the n Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  So , it seems we are not so clear on the shape uh
C :  These buttons
A :  No , I'm not sure uh why uh if it was like this
C :  But it looks really not really good . I mean , the f Yeah . So these are kind of rubber things . Even if you lose one you can just put whatever . Even we can provide many different colours or different fruits , and
D : 
A :  It's n no , it's not fancy any more .
A :  Okay .
B :  And
A :  Uh-huh . And different routes . Okay , I see what
B :  Moreover , moreover it covers it covers all the end goals . Even if it is , you know , it's very rounded , but still you got some rubber fruit here , and it's completely uh completely secure to leave it uh with children and that .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so you you you feel like it's something uh a protection for the remote control .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah , we've yeah we have sensors here and so here and here , so we just Yeah , so even if you don't put , it works . But this is really fancy .
A :  Also .
A :  Okay .
D :  I suggested three . Because uh , everybody s doesn't seem to be convince , although it's quite You have good arguments . But
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  And uh the last one is adaptive . This is not r maybe not as important as the other one , but uh can we adapt it to each each personal use ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Sure , sure , just look at it .
D :  Great . Fully adaptable . That's Yeah . So you can fit into your palm , okay . That What else can we need ? You Do you think you are gonna be able to do that with ti titanium as well ?
B :  It's full adaptable .
A :  Wow , that's a
B :  Yeah , you can fit it into your palm , you know .
C :  Yeah . You can Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it's fudge titanium . You know . Right , yeah . And uh
D :  It's fudge , yeah , yeah . Yeah , fruit titanium , yeah . Well , I if if this is if you are ready to do that , then I think it deserves a one .
B :  Mm ,
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Let's go for one .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Now we have to do the average .
C :  Three , three , six , eight , eleven .
D :  Who is good in math ?
B :  It's two point one seven .
D :  Okay . Two point one seven . That's nice . Two point one seven out of seven . I think we have a good
C :  Hmm .
C :  .
A :  Yeah .
D :  good thing . Well , that's all I had to say about the evaluation . So
A :  So it's a good evaluation .
D :  It seems to be good , yeah . We have uh
A :  Yeah . Mm .
C :  Yeah mm . Yeah , two one one seven , we have . So
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-mm .
D :  Yeah . Okay . Thanks .
A :  Okay . So now , it has to fulfil the financial criterium ?
D :  Ah-ha .
A :  So , I have an Here . Um
A :  .
D : 
A : 
C :  Energy . Uh , we use bat
D :  So so how many batteries do we need ? One battery ?
C :  One battery . Yep .
A :  Okay , so two .
D :  Good .
D :  Why two ?
C :  Oh , we just need one , I guess .
D :  Say no . No , ne never install .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Two batteries or one ?
A :  Oh .
C :  No , number is one . We need only one battery .
D :  Only one .
A :  Yeah yeah , but the price is two . Oh , number . Sorry sorry sorry . I'm sorry .
D :  No , no . But no , no . No , no way .
B :  No , uh you just Number . Yeah .
C :  Number , number .
D :  Yeah . You never use uh Excel ? Good .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Oh .
A :  No , never .
B :  How What what's the limit ?
A :  H
D :  It's twelve bucks .
B :  Uh , it's it's okay that I don't know , 'cause uh it's not my field . Twelve bucks . Okay , now Mm-hmm . Check that number also .
D :  Twelve bucks . Twelve and a half , I think .
C :  So we
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay , electronics . So
C :  We have sample chip . Uh , like simple chip , yeah . So , yeah . Yeah . Four buttons at least . And then we have the t sample speaker sensor for speech recognition .
D :  It's a simple chip ? Simple chip , okay . One .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  And for the
A :  One also .
D :  One or two ? One ? Okay .
C :  Yeah , one to one . Yeah , one .
D :  So the case , which one uh is it in the end ?
C :  Yeah , I think we will go for a single curve , no ?
D :  Let's do a single curve .
C :  Oh , is
B :  It's it's flat .
D :  It's flat , and curved .
C :  Oh . Oh , okay .
A :  I thought you can curve somebody .
B :  It's flat .
B :  But it is flat , you Look . It's curvable , but it's not curved .
D :  It's curvable .
D :  Maybe there is a supplement for that , no ? It's only curve ? Okay , let's go .
A :  Mm-hmm . Oh see , I I think that the the price is this one .
C :  Yeah .
D :  This Okay , you d We tried , we tried .
A :  Yeah , yeah . Don't chip on me .
C : 
C :  Oh .
B :  Oh , okay .
D :  So , what is it ? T titanium ? Mm , that's expensive . Mm-hmm .
C :  Titanium .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . But she wanted u the fudge titanium . I think it's five , but you don't say .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , well
D :  Let's stick to s titan . Special colour ? No because uh
B :  Well , n Why three ? Why three ?
C :  No , only one , no ?
A :  Mm .
A :  Oh , sorry . Again , I'm See it .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Um
A :  Special colour , or it's only on the
C :  Interface .
D :  Oh .
C :  Yes , in L_C_D_ display . Ok
A :  Yeah , but there is no colour here . So I put it here .
C :  Yeah , an Yeah .
C :  Push-button .
D :  So the L_C_D_
A :  How many push-button ? Three or two ?
C :  Uh , two .
D :  Two .
A :  Is there The scroll-wheel , okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  It's going to be expensive .
C :  One scroll wheel . One L_C_D_
C :  displayed .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um
D :  That's all ? No .
A :  That's that's not We choose this one , and not this one .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Oh , I think , no it's Uh , is it a scroll wheel and pe push button , th this centre one ? Or only only scroll wheel , okay .
C :  Yeah , it's cheaper .
A :  Or only a scroll-wheel .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Only scroll wheel . Yeah mm .
C :  So
D :  You are trying to make make up make us up .
A :  You try to s No , no , no . Because how do you do to y select ?
C :  It's already
D :  No , but you select with the two d the other two buttons , no ?
C :  Ah .
C :  Y ye
A :  Yeah , I mean you you go on the location with your scroll wheel and then you
D :  That's true .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Then it automatically we can just do like you feel , it goes . And it will activate Um , plus , yeah , it's price is really
D :  Yeah .
A :  Stay longer . Okay . Oops . Okay , okay . Um
D :  It should stay . Yeah .
C :  Special colours , yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  For buttons .
C :  Yeah , buttons and strawberries . Yeah .
B :  No , buttons just normal .
C :  Special form .
A :  You you have all of these , no ?
D :  She's very hard on this . Special colour ?
A :  Mm maybe n not this one but
D :  Yeah . No . Special material ?
C :  Uh , we have titan
B :  That's for buttons . But buttons are standard .
D :  Yeah , buttons are the standard buttons . Yeah . It's only buttons , these .
A :  Yeah , so
D :  Nothing special . Okay . So we are at seventeen dot eight .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Not special colours an interest in ?
D :  No , the colour is in the L_C_D_ .
A :  And buttons are not colourised ?
D :  I no .
A :  They are m
C :  Mm , hmm , I think uh because you can just go for a good colours . Yeah , and uh
D :  We can just use this red . It's
A :  Boo-hoo . It's already too expensive . Apparently .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So what is Are we supposed to cut things out now ? Uh , until we get twelve fifty .
A :  Yeah . Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm .
C :  Oh .
A :  So think of what we can cut uh here .
D :  Well ,
D :  if I look at what is the most expensive things , uh it's the L_C_D_ and the speaker .
C :  Sample speaker . Yeah .
A :  Apparently , we have to choose one or the other .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Well , as you may know there's some research done in the field of producing energy from mechanical eng , I mean , producing electricity from mechanical energy .
B :  So , the point is that when you take device and push the button , you produce enough energy
A :  But you don't need a battery ? Mm .
B :  to make electricity . Yeah , that you don't need a battery . So , it's something like hand dynamo robot .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  A real high-tech version of it .
A :  But um it's like the hand dynamo , no ?
D :  So that would
C :  Maybe the jog wheel can be like kind of hand
D :  So , but if we select the hand dynamo it's okay , we only We we win one . That's already that . Okay , let's do that .
C :  is
B :  Okay , but l
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uh it's a it's a beginning . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Why not . Let's do that .
A :  So
C :  Yeah , just remo
A :  One here and here .
A :  'Kay .
B :  And I propose to So uh , about chips . Advanced chip on print , right ? So , put minus one there , please .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I'm not sure if this is legal .
A :  Mm . That's right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Why not ?
C :  Uh , no .
B :  And ?
D :  And ?
A :  M maybe minus uh three , no ?
D :  No . Okay , let's see .
C :  Yeah .
C :  No , no . It's not
B :  So , was there result ? Let's have a look .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm .
C :  It's not changing , no ? It you don't
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah , if Click somewhere , you'll see features . Yes , it does .
B :  Why ?
B :  Oops .
A :  So Oh , sorry . Mm-hmm .
D :  Maybe put minus two , so it looks uh more reasonable .
B :  Yeah . Why not .
D :  Yeah , anyway No , minus two .
B :  Minus .
D :  Nobody will know . It's not recorded , is it ? Okay , we're on time . Good .
A :  Mm .
B :  Good .
A :  Okay .
C :  So now on , we can increase our Still you have two more . Maybe we can use it for our party .
A :  Oh , we can put uh a hand dynamo and a battery if you want . Oh . Both its it's cool .
B :  And a battery and a battery , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  No , now we are exp exceeding I think . It
B :  Now it's fancy , let's add one instead of two .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , that
D :  Is it ?
A :  Yeah , yeah y
D :  I think we're exceeding now . We have to remove the
C :  No , but point five point three .
D :  Uh , it's better . I think they are counting uh We would prefer , yeah . Maximum is maximum . So , remove one of them . Yeah . Okay . Okay , we're uh on target .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Mm . It's maximum and don't have to Yeah , yeah . Uh
C :  Is really strict ? Oh .
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  Uh , mm-mm .
A :  Yeah . Mm . Okay . Mm . So target reached .
D :  I'm just curious to see this uh my address chip on print .
C :  Ho
A :  It's um English uh Yeah .
D :  Trick . Uh , I would say it's the Russian trick , but Anyway No , they may have some their origins , strange origins
A :  Yeah , but uh is uh English . So Mm .
C :  Oh . Uh
B :  Well , I don't know . I don't know .
B :  I am not sure who was programming this calculator , you know .
B :  'Cause uh
B :  I wonder if we put A_ or B_ somewhere instead of a number .
D :  No , no , no . Let's finish this meeting instead .
A :  Mm , let's try . Okay .
C :  And we can discuss all these things in our party .
B : 
A :  I save it uh
D :  What else ?
A :  Okay , so next mm
D :  No . This is right .
A :  No , that's yours . Sorry .
D :  Okay , so finance , that's done . Are the cost under twelve ? Yes . Project evaluation , good .
A :  'Kay .
C :  Mm yeah , very much .
A :  Okay . So now
B :  Next slide .
D :  Project process .
A :  We have to make um
D :  Safe uh asse uh safe assessment .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Mm . See mm how Are we a good team ? Mm .
D :  Yeah , I think we've listened to everybody . Everybody could say what they thought .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  And uh
A :  Is there enough room for creativity ?
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm . And you .
D :  Yeah . When we see the results , there is no doubt there Maybe a lack of leadership ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's really
A :  Mm . Oh . Okay . Well , project evaluation .
C :  Yeah .
B :  M maybe not , huh ?
D :  Team-work , very strong , I would say . Team-work , no problem .
C :  Yeah , our team-work is really strong .
D :  Means .
D :  Whiteboard , digital pens .
C :  Oh , we still , I guess .
B :  What was the Oh yeah , what was good ? Everything . What was bad ?
D :  Yeah , I think white-board is useful . Digital pens , useful .
C :  Hmm .
D :  New ideas found ?
A :  So , you say , is there sheep ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Luck . Okay . So luck , but good . Which imply good uh team performance .
D :  But uh
D :  Yeah , but uh then I I mus
B :  Yeah . A good leader , you know , a good leader is somewhere in the shade and
D :  That's true . And there's uh one very important point . We're on time .
C :  Don't really .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Meetings finish when they have to or even before .
C :  And we also
C :  Mm . We made Mm .
D :  The for meeting it's uh one of the most important thing .
B :  Of course . Uh
A :  Okay . Mm .
B :  Not to waste time , that's important .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , we have other uh remote controls to create .
B :  We need time f
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  Ah , we got new idea , speech recognition , location finding .
A :  A lot of uh
B :  New materials .
D :  Mm . .
C :  New materials , new s uh this fancy strawberry design .
A :  Yeah , uh new ways of doing financial
D :  Mm , yeah .
D :  Hey , just wondering if my uh what about the the pink the pinkness of that uh
C :  And new tricks .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm . They're working on um pink titanium .
D :  . They are working on a Okay , good .
C :  Ah , very .
D :  I think we are great . There's no no other words for that .
B :  Budget .
C :  Yeah .
D :  We are probably the best . Real Reaction is uh Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Alright .
A :  Mm yeah . Yeah , we're really nice . Yeah . Mm . Okay . I think it's
D :  Finished ?
D :  Ah , celebration . Are the costs within the budget ? Of course they are . Yeah . Is the project evaluated ? Yes , it is .
B :  .
A :  Yeah . Uh How Yeah . Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , yeah , it's We got two Good score .
B :  Yeah , it is .
B :  So , we see , we can even forecast .
B :  they propose us like celebration , everything , we could forecast it , right ?
D :  To whom ? To the whole our company ?
C :  Oh , okay .
A :  I'm the one , proposing the celebration . Of course , you know I'm the program manager .
B :  You ?
B :  It was you .
B :  Okay .
D :  So , let's celebrate . Uh
A :  Mm-hmm . Ah um , I think it's finish .
C :  So where we will go now ?
C :  Uh , ye Will go to Italian restaurant , or
D :  I think the meeting
D :  The meeting is over at least . So , we have to go out .
A :  Yeah . Mm .
C :  Ah , okay . We can decide . Yeah .
A :  Mm-mm . And we go to the party .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . Thank you .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
A :  thank you to you . Mm .
A :  So in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the
B :  Okay .
A :  for the remote control . So . So let's see the what
B :  Yeah , so can you go out to the shared folder ?
A :  did you prepare .
B :  Mm the shared folder .
A :  Sh share folder for th your presentation ?
B :  Yes .
B :  We have a presentation .
A :  Because I have here
B :  Uh
B :  So I got the participant uh
B :  three .
B :  W uh .
B :  Three .
B :  It's the final design , yeah .
A :  Okay just one .
B :  S so so I discussed with Guillaume .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right . And uh so we have and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an L_C_D_ or not because it's too expensive . So we come up with two versions . One with and one without L_C_D_s . Um but both comes with a charger and then detachable and uh or control module .
B :  And detachable big buttons for all people um .
C :  S okay so I'll show you the the two prototypes . Here we have the first one with the beautiful uh L_C_D_ um display . You you can s here . And you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . You can uh choose the direction and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function .
B :  So .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  You have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . And here the the switch that control if you want
A :  Why you why you you put it in the the side ?
C :  Well I I I think uh it's the
A :  It's not a good place maybe .
C :  Yeah but
B :  No i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . The the microphone picks up
C :  Yeah .
B :  the speeches from anywhere .
D :  Is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ?
C :  Well so it's a microphone array . No it's just a single microphone , and you I I think uh we we put it here because I think when you when you are browsing your L_C_D_ you will be close to well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . And here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off .
A :  Oh it's very costly , microphone array .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  And uh so this remote control comes up with its charger .
A :  How much does it cost this one ?
C :  Well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars fifteen dollars , but uh well it's not it's not uh yeah , but uh it's just a prototype and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila .
B :  For the
B :  Yeah .
A :  Fifteen dollars ?
A :  Ah it's above it's above the budget .
D :  The cost would be le reduced .
C :  Yeah the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars .
B :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
A :  How many b battery is there ?
C :  How many , excuse me ?
A :  Battery .
C :  Well uh f battery , we use uh about uh
B :  Is it n the two A_A_s batteries in it . A_A_ rechargeable batteries .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Rechargeable of course , because we have the charger .
B :  Yeah rechargeable batteries . We have the charger so it's no problem .
C :  Yeah and you just
A :  So one one battery ?
C :  On uh yeah one battery .
D :  Is that two or one ?
A :  It's kinetic reserve .
B :  Actually uh it's a flexible thing . You just n uh
D :  Now what is the whole day rating for that ?
C :  The excuse me ?
D :  Whole day's rating .
D :  What type of battery ?
C :  Oh yeah it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh if you uh like it's exist .
B :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Something like a two A_ , A_ three size batteries ? Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  So and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . Then the next time you pick it , oh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  At uh yeah . I forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , b this button yeah alright . This button is like the mouse is like a joystick , you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction so you can make a turn and it the additi functions associated to all the actions you ma you have a click you have a double click
C :  it works .
C :  Yeah just explain the button uh Norman .
A :  Mm .
B :  all in a single button . You can move up , down , left , right , or you can do a swing . So a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . So even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . Yeah . This is the version y that comes with L_C_D_ . Here I present another version without the L_C_D_ .
D :  And the L_C_D_ is this one , on the remote ?
C :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think it's not a good idea because after maybe one or two months
B :  Mm .
A :  of function is
A :  getting destroyed . If you
B :  Uh okay this is new prototype uh .
C :  Yeah it's
A : 
C :  So we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . The second version is also simpler , we d uh we had just uh I have to put the microphone also . So basically th it's the same uh yeah . Basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh I presented before . But here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . Press one button uh acting as a a enter button . So um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user .
B :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Uh-huh and also the switch . Okay .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And uh it's also cheaper to produce . We can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars .
A :  No four dollars , it's good .
D :  And I think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , because that's a major that's a
B :  Oh no th actually th we'll come to that point in our
C :  Yeah it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay and if you disable speech recognition system then ?
C :  So
B :  W w I'll I'll come to that point later on .
D :  Mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm .
C :  so Norman will explain to you .
A :  And we will we will serve the charger with this ?
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah of course mm .
B :  Th they either these with the uh the the charger any in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah .
A :  With the remote control .
A :  Okay so the price of the charger included in the
B :  Uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh . It's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone but uh again depends on the types . I think we have to investigate more on that , but
C :  Thank thank you . And so mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  The price should be below twelve and a half Euro . Well that's so
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but as the Marketing Manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design .
D :  Yeah people are willing to pay more , but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment .
A :  We have we have just
B :  Yeah .
A :  The price of selling is twenty five Euros .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And the price of
C :  Alright please uh go on Norman with the special features .
A :  production
D :  Or uh
B :  Yeah we'll we'll come up to that , the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular so you want more function you pay more . If you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , so is uh modular .
A :  That's for this basis function and if you want more you pay more .
B :  Yeah yeah , for example the L_C_D_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . You want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . So
D :  Something like customised . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm hmm hmm hmm .
D :  Hmm okay .
B :  It's pretty flexible in the yeah price .
C :  You also have the the the two other modules for the parental control
A :  But
B :  Uh yeah yeah you should present that .
D :  And this is other one ?
C :  that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on .
B :  Yeah .
C :  H here is just the the the module for the kids and th if the parents want to watch T_V_ , up they come up with their modules , they just plug in it and they can have all the control they want here . We also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , and it acts like the previous one , you just plug in and it works .
D :  Mm hmm hmm hmm .
B :  Yeah
B :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  simplicity and powerful . Simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n but here you only have few buttons but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . But in addition with simplicity .
B :  So that's the best idea , the cond that that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here . Okay now we come to other important features that I did not tell you . The first one is the speech recogniser , again it's detachable or add-on . And then we also have security feature for example this here oop it's very robust , it doesn't break and the material , what's the material again ? Titanium material .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  The titanium and so it's very uh
A :  Titanium .
B :  Again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , again because this is A_A_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . Lithium-ion may be a good one , but you can replace it with cheaper one , again you pay for what you get , and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . So when you finish watching your T_V_
D :  Yeah that's fine .
B :  and you the you t you turn off the T_V_ ,
B :  uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , so so that's the or is it that's the reminder part . Yeah and um
D :  Okay .
B :  And it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , so we didn't define the vocabulary so it's up to the user to define so sorry ? And then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of T_V_ programmes by genre , and this can be used by the adult or by the children .
D :  Mm hmm hmm hmm .
B :  So instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the T_V_ contents of the night . So it's pretty powerful , and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . Yeah . And and for the materials that is cheap to produce I think uh it's quite clear from yeah . And also like the and the fancy designs yeah . Maybe we can improve more on the design but uh this is the
A :  What what's
A :  Maybe yeah . What's the price to p to produce ?
C :  Well so the price to produce
C :  For uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device .
C :  Uh it's about it
A :  With with with the charge ?
D :  With the charger ?
C :  The without without the charger it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , and finally three dollars for the charger .
C :  So if you uh sum up uh everything
B :  Yeah .
A :  We don't have charger .
C :  wi with the L_C_D_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two .
D :  I think we can use Excel .
C :  It's about so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars .
A :  We don't have all the options .
A :  Charger we don't have charger here either .
B :  Yeah .
A :  No it's
C :  But it's just if you want all functionalities .
A :  it's below the the the budget .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Excuse me ?
A :  It's below the bu
A :  the budget . We
D :  Yeah it's a nice input but we have an
D :  other inputs from the l public demands . I think we will just have a rough look and then we can make our statements , and we can finalise the product based on this discu
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I think we can just go to my presentation then .
D :  We can wind up .
D :  Or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions .
D :  So the marketing made an evaluation criteria and these were some of the findings , and uh
D :  in the market the people are not really interested with L_C_D_ , without L_C_D_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , it should be very fancy with colourful and uh very handy to hold . And the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative .
B :  Mm .
D :  Of course in that we could put L_C_D_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . And the third one is easy to use .
B :  Mm .
C :  Well I think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the T_V_ screen uh uh with just four buttons .
D :  Okay and if we go to the next slide , here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , and so this in Paris and Milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like .
B :  Spongy spongy .
B :  Mm mm .
D :  So I think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . And the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , it should be somewhat spongy .
B :  Mm mm .
C :  Okay .
B :  But the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling ?
D :  Um .
B :  We have you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . Spongy .
C :  A sponge .
D :  Yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias . One is fancy look , second is
D :  innovative , and third is easy to use .
D :  So these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . So and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , say that we have a seven point scale ,
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  from one to seven , and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
D :  So now you have with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ , so on this scale , if it is true ,
B :  Mm .
D :  if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , or if it is false , it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . So
B :  So so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ?
D :  We can make our study on this and
D :  No no we have you have designed two products now , one is with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ?
A :  You .
D :  According to you , no according to you designers , how will feel does it uh with L_C_D_ and without L_C_D_ ?
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay let us make this L_ and without L_C_D_ .
D :  On on this scale the L_C_D_ remote control . How do you look how does it look ? D is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ?
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
C :  Well it doesn't look much fancy I'll I'll say three or four .
D :  And you both agree for that ?
A :  And you ?
B :  I think we can improve on the design . Som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design . Um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . As for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . It's it it
C :  Technical aspects .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So I take three on with L_C_D_ ? So without L_C_D_ how would you rate it ?
C :  Yeah a three .
C :  Uh four . I think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated so
D :  Four .
B :  Yeah .
C :  removing the L_C_D_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look .
B :  Yeah .
D :  And in the sense of innovativeness , with L_C_D_ .
C :  Well it's it's the same for both so I will give a five , six .
B :  Mm .
D :  Five with L_C_D_ and
C :  Well five also uh Norman please .
B :  Yeah from the innovation aspect I feel that uh what is most innovative
A :  Uh
B :  of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting
B :  is that um the retrieval of T_V_ programmes by content , because uh that is really innovative , and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity and simplicity , few buttons , we've uh
C :  With lot of functionalities .
B :  A lot of functionalities . So that is uh that is uh for both th
D :  So without L_C_D_ ?
B :  Our gi I think that the our our product is uh has the best in all well this is a biased judgement because we designed them .
D :  No no according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh the innovation is v is very high I think .
D :  With L_C_D_ . And without L_C_D_ ?
A :  For L_C_D_ .
B :  Both .
C :  Mm for both it's the the same innovations .
B :  For both .
B :  It's the same innovation . So maybe I can put six to seven .
D :  Okay .
C :  six , let's go for six .
A :  Without L_C_D_ .
B :  Both .
D :  No actually uh to make it with L_C_D_ you make more efforts . So I there is high innovativeness included if you make it with L_C_D_ y then when it is without L_C_D_ there is not much innovativeness . So we can't go
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Uh no innovative yeah .
B :  Uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the L_C_D_ ?
C :  Talk about
B :  We haven't really uh determined what are actually actually it's good to have a L_C_D_ but what are we gonna display on a L_C_D_ ?
D :  I mean that what you are sayin that's what the design
D :  No it's like this , I mean on the L_C_D_ , according to what I understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have L_C_D_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . Uh then
A :  So let's remove it .
B :  Yeah ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but
C :  Yeah but you have the same programme on the T_V_ screen .
A :  But
B :  Yes exactly .
A :  This is the problem .
D :  No on the T_V_ you don't it doesn't display on the T_V_ now .
C :  If you have the L_C_D_ , but if n
D :  L_C_D_ ? Then uh there is no meaning in having it on the T_V_ . Or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a
C :  Yeah .
B :  But you cannot display all on a L_C_D_ .
D :  I mean that depends upon your design , so
B :  Anyway for for the users who who who opt for L_C_D_
D :  I mean
B :  we'll give them the give them the L_C_D_ , we give what the customer uh wants , right .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So without L_C_D_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ?
D :  And which do you recommend e easy to use , with L_C_D_ or without L_C_D_ ?
B : 
C :  Well I think both are really easy to use because there are few button buttons , and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product so I will give a six for the easy to use .
B :  Yeah I think sorry .
A :  No it's just if I I see the
A :  the f the rate I think it's better to do it without L_C_D_ .
A :  Because that's with L_C_D_ just will increase the price , and I thi i they have the same rate so without L_C_D_ it will be
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates .
D :  So I mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes according to fruit and vegetable or a spongy touch without L_C_D_ and without speech recognition . Even then our product is going to be very good . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's cheaper to produce .
B :  Mm . S
C :  And uh if the the well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so
D :  Yeah that's right .
B :  Yeah . I have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . I think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . For the young generation easy to use may be very complicated because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . For kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , so that's why we have the parental module .
C :  Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah yeah that's right .
B :  Uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , but but uh what I'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . So in terms of easy to use I think it's very user customisable . User customisation is very important yeah . Yeah so
C :  Yeah .
D :  So without L_C_D_ I just take it five ?
C :  Six .
B :  W uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Or you want it to be six ?
C :  Um six .
B :  I think it's the same .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes as you say , with better uh yeah .
A :  Without L_C_D_ .
D :  S s oh I think it's better to have this without L_C_D_ .
C :  And to improve the the look .
D :  As our Programme Manager s Pro Project Manager says that without L_C_D_ it is going to reduce the cost also , and it's going to be much simpler to use .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so
B :  Yeah .
C :  so let's go back to our laboratory and
B :  To improve on the design .
D :  So .
A :  What a what what about the sys speech recognition ?
B :  Huh ?
A :  what about the integration of speech recognition ?
B :  The speech recogniser is a add-on module .
B :  Right ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  That's going to be an optional . If somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Ah so it's optional with the okay .
D :  It's an optional .
C :  It's optional yeah , since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than
A :  I think it will be I think i
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , because maybe parents will lose these uh
D :  Yeah , but I mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module and so that their parents can't use it .
A :  Yeah . Or ma yeah . Or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , so mayb better if you have all this in the same
D :  In the same set , yeah , and and individual buttons to make them work .
B :  Oh .
B :  The problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . So we might lose the customer because of this . I don't know , what do you think uh ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  So you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional .
B :  Yes exa what do you think , I don't know . You are Marketing Manag .
A :  Uh
D :  I mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a T_V_ or to the number or singles who have a television . So based on that I think
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . But the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ?
A :  I think it inc increase .
C :  Well it's about the same because if
C :  Well you can if you had uh something li
A :  I think it i increases .
C :  Oh no , because if you if you add uh something well yeah maybe because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but
A :  Hmm .
D :  But you can make it on a single P_C_ with three different options .
C :  Yeah yeah yeah it's I think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module , but uh
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
D :  On the same P_C_B_ yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons .
D :  Yeah that's right . I mean you could just provide with an optional .
B :  So so
B :  Yeah i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . So in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , attracting them to come back in again and again . We're not trying to follow the Microsoft and we don't want to the m
D :  So it's something like a Microsoft product update . Updates and we sell it . We make updates and sell it .
A :  And and we we we we we we don't want that .
B :  Yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? Yeah , it depends on the v production .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? Uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ?
C :  Well so
C :  Yeah yeah I think we are yeah but we are also the um well the components will have to change because uh we have to deal with the shape and um but I don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so
D :  Do you require different types of P_C_B_s and
B :  Mm .
D :  Or uh it could be like this the P_C_B_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all .
B :  Mm .
C :  Uh well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well
B :  Yeah .
B :  What we can change is to propose the customers with skins . For example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin and then people just feel that oh I have a new skin and looks better .
D :  Yeah , yeah that's right .
C :  Yeah yeah we can have the same global shape and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah that's right .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah you can pl in what material would that be in uh ?
D :  I think you need to look into the material .
C :  Sponge .
B :  Yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing .
D :  Yeah yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  So
C :  So we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say .
D :  I think the Project Manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models .
A :  Project evaluation project satisfaction , for example .
A :  I don't know , we have to ask these question . We have to give answers so
B :  I suppose that you this criteria , is it ?
A :  Project evaluation .
B :  Room for creativity . This room is a bit small , but but I think it's okay for us to work with .
D :  I feel it's fine , we know we don't need uh I think it's okay .
B :  Yeah mm .
C :  That was good .
D :  This is fine for making a presentat for project presentations .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay . Good job good job .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And the leadership was excellent .
A :  Yeah I think so . He gave you the liberty to talk as you wants .
C :  Fine yes uh .
D :  Yeah that's right . Yeah that's right .
A :  Uh the teamwork was very very good . I was really I am very satisfying to work with
C :  Very democratic .
A :  with you . Oh .
C :  Thank you .
B :  Thank you .
C :  Alright .
B :  Alright .
D :  And new ideas found . Any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ?
B :  Mm .
C :  Come up with new product .
D :  I mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ?
A :  Less fancy .
B :  Mm we I I know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings .
C :  Yeah and also more well uh more seriously I think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , but
B :  Mm .
C :  I think it's alright . We achieved uh project goal I think .
D :  Yeah that is within the budget .
C :  It's w yes , more or less .
B :  Mm .
D :  And the evaluation was
A :  Without without L_C_D_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple .
D :  Yeah that's right .
C :  Yeah but
C :  Alright .
D :  And the next is celebration .
C :  So .
D :  So
C :  So uh coffee machine . Okay .
B :  Alright then , we finished ?
A :  Yeah free free coffee .
A :  Yeah thank you for your work and
D :  Yeah thank you , thank you very much .
B :  Thank you very much .
B :  I'm sorry to be late .
A :  Welcome back . Welcome back everybody .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Thanks .
A :  So this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting .
A :  And uh
A :  opening and uh P_M_s of the meet minutes , uh prototype presentation from uh Christine and uh Agnes .
B :  Agnes , yes .
A :  Yes and uh evaluation criteria .
A :  The finance , it's uh from my side , from the management , and uh production evaluation . Then uh closing . So we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , so
A :  Okay , let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype .
C :  Mm , okay .
A :  So I handle to
C :  I've done a presentation , but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , so if I'm missing anything , Christine can just correct me .
A :  So shall I go to sorry .
B :  Uh thank you , so you did a PowerPoint presentation , good for you .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay , let's go to A_M_I_ .
C :  It's not the biggest PowerPoint presentation in the world , but
A :  So in two or three or
C :  Three .
C :  Um .
C :  No it's think it's the last one .
D :  Probably .
D :  Technical pa I would think .
C :  No , then this is the la yeah , that one , final design . It is named appropriately , you just couldn't see the name . Um okay , can I have the mouse ?
D :  Ha .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yes .
C :  Thanks .
C :  Alright , so
C :  from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , the material that we chose was wood , and uh the colour would be customisable , 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour .
C :  Um , so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the T_V_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , and we've incorporated the L_C_D_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . Um , so
C :  to unveil our lovely product .
C :  This is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see .
C :  So if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow L_C_D_ display . Um , this is actually hard to do . The yellow button you have is the on off button , so it's really big , hard to miss .
C :  You have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . So up volume up , down volume down . The green are the channel changing .
C :  S And it's one of those very light , very touchable displays .
C :  And then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the T_V_ , and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . So this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So .
B :  Um and uh I could
C :  Oh yes . Additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing and I suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . So that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control .
B :  Yeah the d
B :  We haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . That depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um
C :  Yeah .
A :  I think the microphone is on on the top , uh on the middle , the under the flip .
B :  Yes , okay .
B :  Uh-huh .
A :  So that will be the safe , so p any the chip it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to
B :  No , I mean it depends on the design of the circuit board .
A :  Yes .
C :  But it shouldn't be under the flip either , because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice .
A :  Uh it's it's
A :  Yeah , but uh uh my opinion I think it's better under the flip because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . But if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical I don't think it's uh feasible , 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised .
C :  But if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? I mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and I'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , I can just use my voice .
B :  Maybe I've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and I'm holding my cup of Coca-Cola in the other hand .
C :  Yeah . And you don't wanna let go of either one .
D :  I don't wanna say . Louder . Yeah .
C :  I mean it doesn't have to be on the flip , it can be on the side somewhere .
D :  Can also be on the side .
A :  Yeah , the sides maybe is good . So That's good idea .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So , I mean I can pass this around if anyone wants to
A :  Yes . So it's maybe good idea .
B :  Yeah , y better you pass it around with a napkin .
D :  No , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yes .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , exactly .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So it's maybe good idea .
A :  S s
B :  It's um
D :  Compliments to the artist .
B :  It's um
B :  You need to work on the weight a little bit .
D :  Uh .
C :  Yes . And maybe the shape of the buttons , the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but
A :  Okay . S
A :  I'm fine , I'm satisfi I'm satisfied .
B :  We're glad you're satisfied .
A :  Of course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy , but I think when it's completely maybe it's a less weight .
C :  Yeah . I mean this is plasticene . There's only so much you can do . We could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well .
A :  Yes .
C :  But
C :  And part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . So I mean maybe this is excessively heavy , but I think it needs to have some weight , it needs to feel like you're still holding something .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
C :  So that's pretty much it for our presentation actually .
A :  That's your uh prototype model ? Okay , that's good , thank you very much . So any comments or uh
C :  Yeah .
D :  Well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings . Now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh
A :  Okay .
A :  Yes , that uh
A :  So I'll come back to the
A :  So evaluation criteria , I think uh that will be good , so then let's come to the finance uh , I have some uh calculations which I made uh as for uh the budget .
A :  So here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells .
A :  Uh it's optional , somewhat optional and Ed wants the chip on print , that's what uh we were talking about that .
A :  So then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then uh we have the wood material , then special colour and push button .
A :  So it's uh actually , our budget was uh twelve point five Euro , but uh it's coming to nine point nine five Euro , so we are under uh below the budget , okay , so still we are saving some money .
A :  I think it's a good figure .
B :  Yes , great I I'm surprised . Congratulations .
A :  Than thank you .
D :  Well we haven't come to mine yet , so we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes .
B :  Oh , okay . It's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ?
A :  So maybe it's for some money we can utilise for our uh marketing , for the sales , okay , and uh
D :  Well , it just depends on if we're gonna add a o on this pr
D :  provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a L_C_ display . L_C_ display is gonna be very expensive , it's gonna be
C :  No we do , but it's not filled in . It's number thirty . Oh , yeah , yeah , you're right , sorry , yes .
D :  It's not it doesn't say . We don't have the price up there , okay , so if we add approximately two to three Euro per
A :  It's not . Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Thirty .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested . Um
B :  So that means we can put the uh
D :  Display in . But as far as production um I'm putting up a question because we're talking about profit also , and in mine you'll see uh
B :  the L_C_D_ in , yeah .
D :  the problem with uh our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration .
D :  Uh this is just production cost , it is not uh advertising cost , it's not transportation cost uh
A :  Yes , so still uh we have twelve point five Euro .
D :  And that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company . So to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million Pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways .
A :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , but
A :  Yes . Yep .
C :  Um-hmm .
A :  Yes . This we are talking about one unit , okay , so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down .
D :  Yes .
B :  Although customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on on-order basis , it might be uh the the quantity won't m won't uh the circuit board will b you're right , would be in producing quantity , but the cost of the case would uh be fixed at the
D :  Slightly .
A :  Yeah .
D :  It's gonna be very hard to reduce .
C :  Yes .
B :  Uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one Euro . That's really that's the cost of the material and lab wow , that's really outstanding .
D :  That's not bad .
A :  Yep .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But anyhow , still we are under control , okay , so what uh I will do is I will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , so that uh I will look after . I will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down .
D :  If we can go to to my display .
D :  And we'll come back to yours just to give everybody an idea of the market .
A :  Yes .
D :  So now I'm gonna scare everybody out of this project .
D :  If I'm still here . Yep .
A :  You're in four ?
D :  The four gives me it's gotta be uh TrendWatch .
A :  TrendWatch .
B :  Is this the same one you did before ?
D :  No .
B :  Okay .
D :  It shouldn't be if it's not it's not the right one . No , no we g no , that's the same one . You have to go back and find another one .
C :  That's no , I think it's the same one .
D :  Whatever name it popped up under .
D :  Uh functional , try functional , it might not be it either , but we'll see .
C :  Functional .
C :  It looks like it , there's
D :  Yep , that's it . So we'll go screen by screen . Although since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . Okay ? Our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million which is approximately the same as the independent study .
C :  S Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yep .
D :  So if we continue , we'll look at the findings . Next screen .
D :  Which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , which is actually a tremendous amount .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , no kidding .
D :  No kidding , yeah .
B :  Mayb maybe they already expected something .
D :  So , if we put an inflated price of fifty Euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five Euro , okay , we're already in that that price , okay , with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers .
A :  Yes .
C :  Um-hmm .
D :  Twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . At two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five Euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit Eu Euro profit . Okay ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
D :  So , obviously we w w I just did a run down the evaluation of the form , the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . Now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production .
D :  Or we project this over two years , but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . So , now we have to come up with a decision . Can the company sell two million units ? Can it sell it for fifty Euros ?
A :  Yes .
A :  Yep .
A :  Of course .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
B :  Could could I go to findings ? Uh uh um I would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence . That way you have no storage , you have no um you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , but you don't have the transport to the uh point of sale . The point of sale is online .
A :  Yep .
C :  I was thinking the same thing , yeah .
A :  Yes .
C :  Directly .
C :  Um-hmm .
A :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
A :  To the agents .
C :  Yeah . You can do a shipping centre somewhere , or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs .
B :  Right , like Amazon . In fact , we should sell through Amazon , don't you think ? Or eBay , yeah .
A :  Yes .
A :  Or eBay , or
A :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
B :  There's an idea . Going with um
A :  Yeah , that's a good idea .
A :  To impro more profit and uh
D :  S Upscale technology . Well .
A :  Yeah , yes .
B :  Ah , we we're do you know , selling a unique product uh .
C :  That actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , whereas if you're in a store , you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want , whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and
B :  Mm .
D :  There are several companies that have gone that way .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di the only thing that you're missing really is the weight .
C :  Yeah .
C :  The weight and feel .
D :  Weight , the feel of the product , but
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  We're getting used to that . It's not quite like trying on a shoe , but
B :  people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  There are several that have gone through with the watches , too . You can customise a watch , you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production , you can change it uh
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Uh-huh .
D :  There's a lot of online that's that is doing this now .
C :  Yes .
D :  And when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way uh it's possible to do with this , maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  We can .
B :  Great .
A :  I don't think that's uh not possible , it's uh okay then , l uh let's wait for the production , okay , then uh you can evaluate the product , so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real .
C :  What turnaround time do we have ?
C :  'Cause I mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long .
A :  Oh but
A :  Yes it's it's very quick , of course . It will uh come back in two weeks , okay , it will be ready in two weeks . For evaluation , okay .
B :  Works for me .
B :  Prototypes , you mean . In um
A :  Yes , the prototype uh prototype product evaluation .
B :  We probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it .
A :  Yes .
D :  Well , obviously .
A :  Yes . Yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , to see get get their
A :  Yeah .
A :  So you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use it's not a trivial task .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , because we we are not going to do it in uh our factory , okay , so we can give it a product evalua Yes , yes .
C :  No no . We definitely shouldn't do it in our factory .
A :  So we'll do it in the other place , and I don't think it's take more than four weeks time .
A :  Or uh
A :  Okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , then uh it's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team , okay , uh from the management , then we can launch in the market .
A :  Hm ?
B :  Any outstanding ?
A :  S Any any other uh questions or uh comments to be discuss ?
B :  No , I'm go ahead .
C :  What ab
D :  I think we pretty much covered everything .
A :  Okay , so then uh
B :  Did you have something ?
C :  Well I was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently .
A :  Okay uh , let's take like this . Let's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay . So no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design .
A :  Okay ? So we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can uh go for the
B :  Second generation .
A :  second generation .
A :  Okay . There's no end , there's not limit . Every every custom
C :  The problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of .
D :  Well , then it may not be .
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit .
D :  Like people don't like wood .
C :  No , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up .
D :  very specific .
A :  Yeah , so that's the reason you are here for uh the design , okay , I hope you made a good design .
C :  Yes , but I'm not everybody . I mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . We have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell .
A :  Yeah , but uh see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like uh you can eat uh you can all eat more chi I can eat more chilli , okay , so i it's a depends on the individual taste , you know , so we have we have to balance somewhere .
C :  Yeah , of course . I'm just trying to point out that I think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short well you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and
A :  Yes .
B :  Our project doesn't um
A :  Yeah .
B :  Ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for T_V_ remote control sales ?
D :  Hmm .
B :  Would it be the Christmas season by any chance ? Sports season .
A :  The sports time .
D :  Right before the Eur the World Cup . World soccer . World Cup soccer , they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control .
B :  Which sport season ?
A :  Football .
B :  So so
C :  Yeah .
A :  Football .
B :  maybe what
B :  So I think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event . And and then um so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated , because I don't know when the World Cup is , but I'm sure there's gonna be one .
A :  Yes .
A :  Yes .
C :  Yeah , that's a good idea .
D :  Or any major sports .
B :  Or another m major sports event . Probably not the um the football games coming up the end of January . I think that might be a little too aggressive um , but , so , I'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event or uh perhaps to uh also
A :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Research .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
C :  That's actually good place to advertise it too .
B :  And to work with motion pictures . There might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on D_V_D_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , so we could maybe work out a campaign with uh with Sony Pictures for example . Maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yes .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yes , the that of course uh I will convince the management to do that , okay .
B :  That's great .
C :  It's just something to to keep in mind , 'cause it's really really important . A lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy .
A :  Sure , sure , yes .
B :  Disposable diapers is an example of that in fact . Yes , it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product , and uh people the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it wasn't uh but then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design , but people had gotten the throw-away , you know , paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't um so , you're right , timing is very important , but I think we've got a good product .
C :  Really ? That I didn't know .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  That's the reason Ed is here . I think he can promote the the brand value and the product value . Yes .
B :  That's right .
B :  It's gonna be very important to the company .
A :  We are behind the scene and he is the front screen , so .
C :  Yep .
D :  Yeah , I'm the one who takes the heat . If it's a flop , it's the marketer .
A :  He's on the big screen .
C :  Exactly .
B :  Good luck , Ed .
B :  You look very relaxed , considering h you know , the uh the weight on your shoulders , yeah .
D :  Yes . Yes . Stress .
A :  Okay , so then uh let's come to the closing and uh are the costs within the budget and uh is the product evaluated , okay , so that will uh come soon . Okay for uh but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and uh great design and uh let's leave it to the Ed for later for once production is
D :  Celebration .
A :  over and the meantime let's celebrate . So let's meet up uh this evening to hang up for some party .
B :  Sounds good . Thank you . Nice working with you .
A :  'S good .
D :  Very good .
C :  Okay .
D :  Thank you very much . Bye-bye . Yep , okay , see you later on .
A :  Thank you . Thank you again for all .
C :  Thanks .
C :  Bye .
A :  And see you in the evening for drinks .
A :  Well hi everyone again .
C :  Hello .
B :  Hello .
A :  Um like before we uh I have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting and so here we go .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um
A :  designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote and um it is to send messages of course to the T_V_ . It should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera .
B :  Designer .
A :  It should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . Uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . Um .
A :  Should be child friendly design with few buttons , colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . Um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose .
D :  And she was challenged on that point
A :  Um
A :  that's right .
B :  Yes .
A :  But uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . The industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue . She would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful .
A :  Should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant .
A :  She would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . Uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , and if possible a rechargeable battery .
A :  Uh and of course a circuit board .
A :  And how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider .
D :  Okay .
A :  She would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip
A :  uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore .
A :  Should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases .
A :  The marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small ,
A :  easy to use and it should be eye catching .
A :  From her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does .
A :  To do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on .
A :  Too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . So we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home .
A :  Um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . She feels that's really what people want today .
A :  And the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser ,
A :  the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , should be trendy design , compact and strong , and should have buttons .
A :  And that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting .
A :  Now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Just the look like , the button part I'll explain .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh so this is our what uh we have made . This is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . Uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive um and it's it's blue in colour uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons so it is a uh uh a looks-wise it is beautiful . Uh and also compact in shape . Uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Good .
C :  Yeah , oops , sorry .
D :  You used to have all the buttons
C :  Um yeah and um uh the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic and uh w which which is s strong um uh and also uh for the
C :  Um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber um and als yeah . Yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it .
D :  Oh that's good , no , that's nice and friendly .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And then um uh for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green and it's a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And and the button button's part uh will be explained by F Francina .
B :  Okay . Now the um we decided upon including certain features on our remote . Now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it's the led or L_E_D_ the infrared . Now uh we have included the switch on and off button .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , okay , mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Now we have included another feature that is the mute button
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  on the side of the model . Then we have included one to nine buttons
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  for controlling the programmes the different channels .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels .
D :  Mm .
B :  Now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button .
A :  What kind of button ?
B :  Menu button .
A :  Menu ? Uh menu th menu , uh one one .
B :  Yes , menu
D :  Menu button .
B :  At the centre
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness
D :  Mm-hmm . Of the screen . Mm , mm-hmm .
B :  of this uh picture .
B :  We have also included a button which is called as the swapping button .
B :  Now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . Now this button
B :  is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel .
B :  It will take the user to the previous and the next channel so this is a
B :  swapping button .
D :  The next channel in the numeric pattern , or
B :  No , swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . Yes .
D :  Yeah , mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
D :  Okay , okay .
B :  And at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So this is our proposed model . Now the marketing expert has to
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Tell , yeah .
B :  give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective .
D :  Okay , well um
D :  what what I really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ?
B :  Yes , yes .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yes the buttons are all raised , right ?
B :  Yes .
D :  The buttons are all raised and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , I really like that . You really did a good job on that , my little designers . Um and um I like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . That's that's a really good good thing .
A :  Are raised , mm-hmm .
A :  Right .
A :  Or have two hands to operate it , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yes , and it sort of sticks up so that you really you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah , mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , that's great .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Abs okay .
D :  The colour's very attractive . Um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute
B :  No , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . Yes , yes .
D :  and these mm-hmm
D :  On both sides they're mute ? So you can push either one ? Okay .
B :  Yes .
A :  So if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter .
D :  And this brings the menu up on the screen ? This brings the menu up on the screen and the orange ones are
B :  Pardon me ?
B :  This is the menu yes , yes .
B :  A the the these these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels .
D :  Okay .
D :  F f okay . Right , very good .
B :  Scroll up or scroll down the channels .
D :  Uh it looks mm looks like something I can sell .
D :  Okay and now I'm supposed to yeah .
A :  Well , I have one question uh will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ?
B :  Yes , it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . Yes , which can be easily recognised .
C :  Ah .
C :  Yeah , definitely .
A :  Will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Good point because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah of course , and also
B :  Yes .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah . But anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah we can
D :  Symbols on it . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
C :  Text .
B :  Yes .
C :  Text that we can have on the case itself , we can it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons . Yeah .
B :  Yes .
A :  That's right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm .
B :  And
D :  Mm , 'kay , mm .
B :  and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . A shell shape .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  For the snail , yeah , mm-hmm , we have the snail shell . He goes right back into his shell . Well you know I think we could do something really funny with this too because the snail is known to be slow and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that you know that would , that would really work . So
B :  Yes , yes .
A :  Right , mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So it is yeah , yeah shell .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , snail shell .
B :  Yes .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
B :  Y Yes
C :  Yeah , of course , yeah .
A :  Now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? That's really the voice recognition that's really unusual
D :  I think voice recognition is our big selling point 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range .
C :  Mm . Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
A :  And then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use .
D :  Yep uh well I think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . I think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance . We're really gonna have the be the
A :  You know .
A :  Colours .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Cutest .
D :  cutest remote control on the block . So I think we have to play with the image , play with the snail image um play with the visual and then the voice recognition . I think those are the two things to push . The look
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  and the voice recognition . They're gonna be our two selling points .
A :  Okay , now uh having said that
D :  I'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't I ?
A :  No , now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done . Now we're gonna talk about financing .
D :  Okay .
D :  Ah , but in my instructions I think it said I was supposed to go to the board and do something . No ?
A :  Well , there is a production evaluation . Is that you ?
D :  Yeah , that's me .
A :  But that's after the financing . See ? Fi see ?
D :  Oh , okay . Sorry , sorry . Mm-mm .
A :  Um .
A :  Okay , we had looks and voice recognition . Okay now on the financing we bring up the mm there it is . Okay uh energy source we say that's battery , right ?
C :  Mm .
D :  That's right .
A :  Okay , now .
A :  So we I guess we use one .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
A :  What ?
A :  T cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . Well , that's nice .
A :  She told me I could just ch change it here and then it would
A :  It doesn't work .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? Or
A :  Oh , okay yeah , okay , let's see . Okay , one , okay . Oh go away . Um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need . Uh electronics , simple chip on print ? Is that's what we're using ? One of those ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yes .
A :  Come on . Okay , one . Uh regular chip on print . No .
C :  No .
A :  That's all we need , the one case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Well .
C :  This is a
B :  Single curve ? Mm .
D :  I guess it's double curved .
A :  Double curved ? One of those ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Case materi s supplements . Plastic we said , right ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Plastic .
A :  Uh wood , rubber ?
D :  Rubber , because we're gonna have the soft buttons .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uh but , yes but
C :  I think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material .
A :  That's just for the case material , so special colours though , we having that , right ?
B :  Is this for the case ? Yes .
D :  Oh okay , the mm-hmm , mm' kay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And then we have to interface push buttons .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
A :  Scroll wheel , no . Integrated scroll wheel , L_C_ display ?
D :  No , 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , right ?
B :  No .
A :  Button .
C :  Yeah .
A :  No .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh , button supplement special colour ?
A :  Special form ?
B :  Yes d we do have special form .
D :  Yes .
A :  And special material , rubber , wood , yes .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Total seven point six whatever that means .
C :  Uh , I think that's the price .
B :  One two three four five six seven eight nine
A :  That's the price .
C :  Maybe it is it just n
A :  Mm ?
A :  Eight , eight point two .
B :  Nine points , okay , yes .
A :  That's hmm ?
A :  Eight point two , right ?
A :  So , we looks like we are
A :  well within budget .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  I guess I should save this I suppose , huh ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Oops .
A :  Uh-huh huh huh .
B :  On the desktop .
A :  I just tried that . My documents , computer . My compu Ah oh here it is , yes .
C :  AMI .
C :  AMI should for
A :  Okay , fine . Save .
A :  Okay good , so that's the good news . We gonna be popular . Um .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So that uh I think financing was pretty simple .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation .
D :  Okay , I'll take my file down so you can bring it up .
D :  'Kay should be able to get it now .
D :  'Kay , why don't you move just to the next slide right away .
A :  You wanna go to the next slide ? Okay .
D :  Yeah right away . Okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? And I think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of . We can't accept every suggestion of course , but maybe we just need to get a few . And show the the prototype to consumer research groups , we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . So we have to get some input from those people . And then after that we just have to go with our best intuition and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . Um , next slide please .
B :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay , now the things that I was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . I wanted the shape to be biomorphic , I didn't want anything with angles and all square , I wanted it to be comfy and roundy so we we've got that . The size is small , the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . We wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , we'll have the soft buttons and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand so that's nice . And functionality I put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . So paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . They don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Fee selling .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um so they'll be our main selling points . So um th those have been fulfilled by your prototype and go ahead to the next slide please . Okay , so um the shape um I think is a a one . That's really , really excellent shape . The size is small um and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how I feel . I think that it's I think that it's plenty small enough to sell but I think we're sort of right the scale is one to seven . I think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors .
B :  Okay .
D :  And our colour I think is great . The colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . And given um the constraints that we had I think we got it as soft as possible . And then functionality um I think you did a really good job on functionality , obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else so I would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . So I think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it .
B :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um I just realised one thing . In the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
D :  Ah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And uh I don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too .
D :  Well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ?
A :  Eight , eight twenty , yes .
C :  Eight twenty so
D :  And so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend .
C :  We have um four euros , yeah
A :  I mean maximum we have another four point three euros I mean four thirty .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well um that's
A :  But I mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So um we just have to beware of that . I mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . So we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . And um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway . As we've seen with so many of these kinds of products .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yes , yes .
C :  Yeah , still .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I'm sorry to interrupt then but I just uh recog I just remembered that there was no that that was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features , okay ? So to beware of that . You wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ?
C :  Included , yeah .
C :  Hmm , hmm
B :  Yeah mm .
D :  Uh , well I isn't this my last slide ? Maybe . Go ahead . I think that was my last slide , yeah . Um .
A :  I dunno . Yes it is . Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm okay .
D :  And I'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . Um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , so if you put my last slide back up there .
A :  Oh .
D :  I'm sorry I've um forgot to do that , um .
A :  Why ? Wh why you need that up ?
D :  Hmm ? Well because I can't remember what I put on there .
D :  Okay . Now I'm supposed to see how long my leash is here .
A :  I think you can make it there .
D :  Mm 'kay .
D :  You ready . So now we're all supposed to say what we think . Um okay so on shape
D :  I gave it a one .
D :  Wait what would you ra uh one being good and seven being the worst . Um what do you think the shape is ? One , okay , and Be Betsy ?
B :  Worse , okay .
B :  One .
A :  Yes I think uh shape is one .
C :  Yeah , even my yeah , shape is one .
D :  Okay , uh-huh one , okay . And how about on size ?
D :  On size
A :  You you gave it a four .
D :  I gave it a four , yeah , I feel it's just average .
A :  Um , I dunno .
A :  I think I would give it at least a two .
D :  Okay .
B :  One .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , even I think it is one . It's quite small .
D :  Okay . Okay you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one . Um and then how about how we doing on colour ?
C : 
A :  Colour uh I
D :  Colour , I gave it a one . I really like all those nice bright , warm colours .
A :  One .
A :  I I like the colours . One .
B :  One . Yes .
D :  One .
C :  Yeah , one .
D :  One , one , one , okay . And how about the feel ?
D :  Taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand .
A :  Uh , I think I would give it a two .
D :  Okay , I gave it a three , two , yeah ? Three .
B :  I'll give three .
C :  Uh maybe two , yeah .
D :  Two , okay .
D :  And the next is functionality where I I admit I was a little hard on our team here , but
A :  Well it's also you can't really try it out uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view but um
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I'll give it a three .
D :  Okay .
B :  Two .
D :  Two , okay .
C :  Uh three , mm-hmm .
D :  Three ?
D :  Okay .
D :  Well , um .
D :  It looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product . Um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . But um otherwise I think we're we're ready to go to go with this product .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ?
A :  Uh .
A :  Here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity .
A :  Um .
A :  Is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ?
B :  We can always improve , yes .
C :  Maybe we can
C :  yeah , include some more buttons and uh um yeah features . We can make the buttons few buttons smaller . Uh I think they are quite big , so I think I I mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . If we want to have more features than that .
B :  Yes , features .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . So that that's where we're gonna have to do maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . And um then maybe we can do something with the um
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , definitely .
B :  Yes .
B :  Voices .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons .
B :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
D :  the volume control . Maybe we can put that all on one button .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget and that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things . Uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser .
B :  And maybe
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  No .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um .
A :  So th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? Uh , um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ?
A :  Uh I think personally I think uh I'm pretty happy .
D :  I'm pretty happy with it too , yeah um , it's something I think I can market . Yeah .
C :  Even I'm happy .
A :  Um an
C :  Yeah .
A :  and then the next question is are we happy with the leadership of this project ? Uh
D :  I think you've done a good job , Miss leader .
B :  Yes , yes you've done a good job .
C :  Yeah , yeah , definitely .
A :  And I think team work I think was very very good , I think we really yeah .
D :  Yeah I d I do too I think we worked well together as a team , yeah . Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And uh I think we are we happy with the means we used ? We used whiteboard , we didn't use digital p well digital pens I guess are these things .
D :  Yeah maybe we could've used the whiteboard a little bit more , yeah , we didn't use that enough .
B :  Whiteboard more , yes , yes .
C :  Yeah , probably .
A :  Yes , we could . Uh , it's maybe not in the best position in the room um you know like sometimes it's positioned so that it's much better visible for everybody and I think from that point of view we sort of ignored it a little bit .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And we used the slide because it was better positioned .
B :  Yes .
A :  Yes , I think so , I think absolutely , and fortunately we all had slides presentation which made it a little easier . Um did we new did we find new ideas ? I think we did .
C :  Yeah .
B :  No .
D :  Mm I think that's true mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah , many .
D :  I think we were we were very good , yeah , mm .
A :  I think we we did , uh in more than one respect and uh so I think we did very well here .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Are the costs within budget ? Yes , yes . Uh is the project evaluated ? Yes . Um then celebration .
D :  Yes , yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Celebration . Today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne .
B :  Cel celebration yes , yes .
C :  Ah .
A :  So I I thank you all very much . Um , I think this was very good and um
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible . Feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So , thank you .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Thank you .
C :  Thank you very much .
D :  Okay . Watch I I have my cord behind you here . Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  I always get it on here , but getting it off is
C :  Do we do we have some time left ?
C :  Uh you have
B :  They say it's forty minutes .
A :  Ah yes we have time later but we don't
D :  But we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished .
B :  Okay .
C :  Oh , alright .
D :  It'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace .
D :  Oh , there we go .
B :  Okay we all all set ? Right . Well this is the uh final detailed design meeting . Um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . And the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , like absolute final decision , um and then I'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report .
B :  So um just from from last time to recap , we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no L_C_D_ display , no need for talk-back , it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal L_E_D_s to shine through the casing , um hopefully a jog-dial , and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . Anything I've missed ? Okay um so uh if you want to present your prototype go ahead .
A :  No .
D :  Uh-oh . This is it ? Um , there are a few changes we've made . Um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , so instead we've um this is gonna be an L_C_D_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm
A :  Ninja Homer , made in Japan .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  um button . Uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time .
C :  Mm 'kay .
A :  And there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? So the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use .
C :  Where are they ?
A :  Um they're in the L_C_D_ panel and the jog-dial ? Okay 'cause
C :  Ah , right . Great .
B :  So w what kind of thing uh is gonna be
A :  The L_C_D_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing . If you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say You know it's like it only has four columns , it's a very simple L_C_D_ like , whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast .
C :  Right .
C :  Okay .
C :  Right .
B :  Mm-hmm . Okay cool .
C :  Right , 'kay .
A :  It might even be one , a bit more complex L_C_D_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm , and what is this here ?
B :  Oh right okay . Cool .
A :  That's a number pad .
C :  Okay so the number pad is 'Kay , great .
B :  Where are we gonna have the slogan ?
A :  Um they're al along this Yeah .
D :  You know , just like right inside there .
B :  Okay cool .
A :  You have this space here , and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom .
B :  Okay .
A :  'Cause slogans are usually quite small , right , they're not like huge so they're s
C :  Mm .
C :  Yep .
A :  Say a button's about say a button's about this size , right , so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that .
B :  Okay .
C :  Looks good .
C :  Yep .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So if this isn't to scale , what kind of
B :  dimensions are you thinking about here ?
D :  Well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yep so that would be about a centimetre for a button , so one two three
A :  four centimetres . Plus maybe half o five
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  About nine in total .
A :  six seven eight , about yeah nine total .
B :  Six , seven , eight , nine , ten .
B :  So we're talking about ten centimetres . That would be good . So ten centimetres in height . Okay um .
C :  That sounds good . Yeah .
C :  Yep .
A :  Nine , ten .
A :  Yep .
C :  That'd be good , in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually , so that would be that sounds like a really good size , if you see it there .
B :  Yeah .
B :  That's great and it's very bright as well . So um okay .
C :  Mm .
C :  Is it possible uh I'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . Is these are these the colours that of production , or is this just what we had available ?
D :  Well I'm
D :  We're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button .
C :  Right .
D :  Um
B :  Okay so just could you just list all the things that it does s so I can write them in the report .
D :  But um this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal . Um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the L_C_D_ screen and you use this as a jog-dial .
A :  Excuse me .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Sure .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay so that's like an okay button , right .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ?
D :  I don't know .
B :  Okay .
C :  How high is it ?
A :  No as in the height , but what about the width ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Didn't put five centimetres .
B :  Oh oh like depth of the actual thing .
A :  Do we need five ? I don't think five is be about th three and a half .
D :  Um .
C :  Okay .
D :  Something by there .
B :  Oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay . So you can power on and off , what else can you do ?
A :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Sure .
C :  Three and a half .
D :  Um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons .
B :  Okay .
D :  Um , were gonna have the volume control here , but um because we've got the the L_C_D_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume .
B :  Okay jog-dial for volume .
B :  And what else do you do with the jog-dial ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and
B :  Contrast , brightness , yeah , and anything else ?
D :  Um yeah .
D :  Um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , um we didn't actually go through and specify the
B :  Well of the designers what are they ?
D :  Uh what can a T_V_ do ?
A :  Okay things like um brightness , contrast , um maybe tuning the channels .
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Okay channel tuning . That's a good one .
A :  Um .
A :  What else ? Um the various inputs . Are you having a V_C_R_ , are you having you know which input do you have ?
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B :  Okay auxiliary inputs .
C :  Mm-hmm , probably colour or sharpness .
A :  Um .
A :  Yep , colour , sharpness . Um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them .
B :  Sharpness .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay what about uh sound settings ? Uh d can you change any of those at all ?
C :  Audio .
A :  Audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range .
D :  Um .
D :  the the balance hmm .
A :  Um .
A :  Yep , left-right balance , um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes , and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting .
B :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay , is there anything else at all it can do ?
C :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  That 'cause that's that's fine . Just need to know so I can write it down . Okay um right I g I guess that's it , so we can now um
B :  We can now have a little look at the
B :  the Excel sheet and price listing , and see if we need to
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  um if we need to rethink anything at all . So um for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? Do we have kinetic as well ? No . Okay , just battery .
A :  The battery .
A :  No .
A :  Um .
A :  We need an
B :  And that's because of cost restraints is it ? Okay um what about the electronics here ? Advanced chip .
A :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah advanced chip . We need an advanced chip I think , yep . Let me just confirm that . Yes I think so .
A :  Yep .
B :  Okay um the case , what does it mean by single and double , do you know ?
D :  Um I think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So we want double-curved ? Okay .
A :  Yep .
B :  Um .
A :  Plastic .
B :  Is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any
A :  I think we're gonna have to skip the rubber .
B :  Okay , um and we wanted special colours didn't we ? So I'll have to put that Oh no wait we ho how many colours have we got there ?
A :  Um .
A :  Yep .
A :  For the case itself , one colour . It's one special colour .
B :  Just one colour , okay .
A :  'Cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it .
B :  Okay so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ?
C :  Mm .
A :  Yes .
A :  One and the L_C_ display .
B :  Okay and then buttons , we have what , two colours ?
A :  How many
D :  Um we have um got some push buttons as well .
C :  Or even clear .
A :  We've got push buttons as well .
B :  Like uh oh wait so push button and integrated scroll wheel push okay .
D :  'Kay .
D :  So I reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber .
B :  Uh-huh .
D :  I'm not sure if that counts but
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay um and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again .
B :  Four . So w why are we arriving at the number four ? Where does the number four come from ?
D :  You can see we're we're all very far beyond the
A :  'Cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons .
B :  Okay right , so we're writing down four .
A :  So we're just estimating that yeah it would be less .
B :  Okay .
B :  How about these ? Are we wanting them in no they're just is everything gonna be plastic ? Okay . So we're w w quite far over . Now we're gonna something's gonna have to go . Um we're at sixteen point eight and
A :  No .
A :  Yep . Yep .
C :  Uh how mm-hmm how are we going to achieve this high-end product if
B :  Well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three Euro , so let me see , what are we I mean oh yes sorry , four point three . My maths is all out .
C :  We only have very sparse
C :  Two point three ? Four point three no ?
D :  Well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And then where is the
A :  How much would that save us ? That will only save you one . The other thing could be that um you could take away the L_C_D_ panel and the advanced chip together , um because when you
B :  How much would that save us ? One .
D :  That is one .
A :  do something on the T_V_ , the T_V_ responds and reacts as well , so the user could be looking at the T_V_ and pushing his thing so we may not need to so when we scroll we need just some way to get the T_V_ to respond , which I think is a technically doable thing so
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  That's fair enough , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay so
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So w what's our reviewed suggestion ? Um take away the L_C_ display ?
A :  Yep .
A :  And the advanced chip goes away as well .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  To be replaced with a regular chip .
A :  Regular chip .
A :  Yep .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  So what that means is that um
B :  And so we've got point three to get rid of . Um and we ha where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ?
A :  The twelve buttons that you see there .
B :  Twelve buttons .
D :  That's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so
B :  Yeah .
A :  Functionally you're gonna have to intercept So four is a good estimate for
B :  Do you think ?
A :  Yeah , so you can't actually cut It's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve .
B :  Like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , how can it be something in between ?
A :  It It needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay well we have point three to get rid of somewhere .
A :  We just report that it has to be over budget , or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons .
B :  Mm .
B :  No can do .
C :  Yeah we could just go with um
D :  Yeah w
A :  Normal coloured buttons .
B :  Well do you want colour differentiation here ?
A :  No that's not the button we're talking about . That's the buttons only refer to the pad so
D :  Um
B :  Oh yeah sorry yeah then .
B :  Right so
A :  Should we take that off uh ?
B :  Ah .
A :  Hey it's back to the original . Um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , so that might be some some way of cutting the cost .
B :  That's it .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay , ach that's a shame . Um right , so take away that completely ? Ah . And now we're under budget . So we do have point five Euro to play with if we wanted . Um
D :  So I reckon
C :  How about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ?
B :  Doesn't say so .
C :  Yeah .
C :  That's a freebie .
D :  Reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah that's a good idea .
B :  Just one ?
B :  Does that mean that one button has a special form or
D :  I think there's just one button so handy .
B :  Yeah okay . Well well there we go . So I'm just gonna have to redraw this now . So we're not gonna have the L_C_D_ anymore , and we'll just gonna have an on t on the T_V_ it'll show you what you're doing , which I think is fair enough , and so this is gonna be one big thing here .
B :  Um .
C :  Was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ?
A :  What do you mean by profile ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Sort of flat as possible .
A :  No .
D :  You see I envision it as being um quite deep sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah that's what I was thinking , to Sure , okay .
A :  We didn't have enough Play-Doh to make it three D_ .
C :  Yeah alright yeah fair enough . Okay , just thought I'd ask .
A :  So there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add , and you might want to add in the report , length , width , and height .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right okay . So just to well to be thorough then , width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay and then so height-wise
C :  Hmm .
B :  How how tall do you envisage it being ? About that big ? About two centimetres , okay .
D :  Yeah it works , yeah .
A :  Two .
C :  Two's not very high at all though . Maybe a bit higher ?
A :  This is about this is about two .
A :  Slightly more than two , so
C :  Yeah .
D :  See , about that thick .
B :  Okay . Ach , that is Yeah . Okay we'll s we'll say two point five . Okay um so we have it within cost anyway .
C :  Maybe closer to three even or two and a half .
A :  Okay .
B :  Um so yeah project evaluation is this point .
B :  Um .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right uh .
B :  Okay so can we close that ? This is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be . Someone is gonna have to yeah that's fine that's fine .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um it's probably just I dunno if it's worth getting into , but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , because I've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that
A :  I think that's something that's very hard to catch , so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something . The the look and the colour is something which is cool , but I think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar then um because when you put it on the shelf
C :  Yeah .
C :  Sure , okay .
C :  Yeah , alright .
C :  Okay , sure .
C :  What about button shape ? Square buttons ?
A :  Yeah button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning , 'cause I think positioning is we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Sure .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  pad .
B :  Right um .
B :  So at this point we uh , let me see , discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um
B :  with these four points , with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , and the stuff we had around us I guess . Um , let me see uh
C :  Mm 'kay .
C :  Do you want me to d um
C :  Do you want me to do my um design evaluation last ?
B :  Yeah I wasn't really sure what that was
A :  Maybe we should do the design evaluation first .
C :  Or
B :  Yeah , yeah go for that first . I wasn't entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that , but y you go for it .
C :  Evaluation .
C :  Okay .
C :  Sure .
C :  Um , alright so the way this works , I'm gonna need to plug into PowerPoint , I'll try and do it as quick as possible . Um , this is um I'll just go over your head if that's okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I don't think you need the power , so
C :  What's that ?
A :  No , that's okay that's okay .
C :  I don't need the PowerPoint ?
A :  No , the power cord itself . Yeah , so then you have a bit more freedom to
C :  Oh course , yeah that's true . Let me get that .
C :  A bit more .
C :  Okay , so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a
A :  You you still have your blue fingers .
D : 
D :  Is it ?
A :  You killed a monster .
C :  The idea is that I've set up I've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , and uh so we can review that . Uh I think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but
C :  Doesn't seem like it's going , does it ?
B :  Oh there it is .
C :  Yeah , okay great . Uh and I'm gonna write up our results on the board , so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um sort of review where we stand with it .
C :  Okay , so um
C :  So to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , okay . So these i these i th are the and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so
B :  Mm 'kay .
C :  we just come to an agreement . Okay ? So the first one uh , stylish look and feel .
B :  Okay .
A :  I rate that pretty highly .
B :  Well yeah , I mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good . I dunno like a six or something . What does anybody else think ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour , and I don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
C :  But
B :  Okay .
D :  I'm seeing five then .
C :  What do you guys think ?
B :  I would say five or six . David ?
C :  Okay .
A :  Yep I'm fine with that .
C :  Okay let's go with five then .
B :  Okay .
C :  Fi oh uh just actually the opposite .
A :  It's one to seven , right ?
C :  The So it meant three , okay .
B :  Oh yes sorry then , then I would say two or three .
A :  Wait , what's the scale , one to seven , right ?
D :  One's high-ish isn't it ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , one is high .
D :  Ah , okay so yeah , two or three .
C :  'Kay
A :  Okay , it's upside-down .
C :  Let's go with two point five then . Okay , um control high tech innovation .
B :  Well it has the wee jog-dial but
C :  We had to remove
C :  Yeah , so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , but jog-dial
B :  Mm .
C :  's good .
B :  I'd go with three or four , maybe three .
A :  Say it's more
D :  Eight three .
A :  medium , but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing . Yep .
C :  Okay , three ?
B :  Yeah about three , okay .
C :  Okay , um
C :  Style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design . I shouldn't have said colour , but just
A :  Lemon .
B :  Well that's kind of
A :  Okay , the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , except for the b the the red button , they because for want of a
D :  Yeah .
C :  Sorta .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  But the yellow , I mean it could be a lemon yellow colour , couldn't it ?
C :  Right . Yeah , could be . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , the the yellow is more representative of the colour , but the button itself , the blue can be anything else .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay so we'll go two .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah ?
C :  Okay , and um design is simple to use , simple in features .
B :  Well yeah , I mean it's really basic looking isn't it ? I mean I'd give that nearly a one .
C :  F f yeah f fairly basic , you guys think ?
D :  Yeah one .
A :  Yep , that's fine .
C :  Yeah , one ? Okay .
C :  Um , soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? We've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . Five ?
D :  Yeah I think it's about five .
B :  Five ? That's really low . Well
D :  Yeah well we have to use uh plastic so it's probably gonna be
B :  Yeah I suppose mm 'kay .
C :  That's
A :  Yeah , company logo .
C :  could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? Was that an option ?
D :  I think I'd probably increase the cost . We've only got like what , ten cents left so
A :  I think it'll be cost prohibitive , yeah .
C :  It would cost more than plastic .
C :  Okay , logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ?
A :  Yep .
B :  Yep . Gonna have that on the side , aren't we , like there or something ?
C :  Huh . And um it's within budget , yep . It is , isn't it ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , so we can say then that uh out of a possible or what would be our goal here ?
B :  Out of forty nine , I guess .
C :  Yeah , out of forty nine with with zero being the highest .
C :  We are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five .
B :  'S pretty good .
C :  So it's pretty good .
C :  Translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy
C :  of our original goal .
C :  Right ?
B :  Uh yeah .
C :  I think 'cause if you turn that into
C :  a hundred
C :  it would be about
B :  Twice that , about thirty one .
C :  about thirty one , and then invert that , it's
B :  So yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine , seventy percent yeah .
C :  Oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent .
B :  It's pretty good .
C :  Okay , good . That was just a little formality for us to go through .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yep , oh hundred pound pen . Sorry alright . No .
B :  Nobody saw it , honestly .
A :  The cameras did .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Is that you all have all finished , or
C :  Yeah that's that's me . I did have one other um one other frame I thought , I mean I I d not knowing how we would deal with this information , I thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals . It's not something I need to p push through , but I thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , I don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant , I dunno the Whatever just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon . It's just discussion . I mean obviously we can just abandon this , it's fine . I'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do .
A :  Yep .
B :  Okay .
C :  Um , yep so there . That's all .
B :  Right .
B :  Okay , great um are you submitting the
B :  the um evaluation criteria or am I ? I don't know what your instructions have been .
C :  Um , I think to record it and uh I haven't been asked to submit it yet . Yeah .
B :  Okay , uh just wondering if I need to include it in the minutes , because if you're submitting it anyway then Okay great .
C :  I will , yeah .
A :  It keeps getting too big .
B :  Cool . Um right , uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation .
A :  'Kay I'm I'm listening I'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so I'm playing with the Play-Doh as well .
B :  Oh right , okay .
A :  Just in case you're wondering , why is he still playing with the Play-Doh ?
C :  Huh .
A :  Just about right L_E_G_O_ Lego .
D :  My leg .
B :  Right , okay . Um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and or not those four points , my four points , sorry , forgotten that .
B :  You got a different uh
C :  Yep .
C :  I like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . It's really quick .
B :  Oh yeah , they're good aren't they , yeah . Right okay , um yeah here we are . Uh as a note we'll do this
C :  To use .
B :  alphabetically . Um do you wanna start Andrew ?
C :  Sure , um so what is it you're asking of me now ?
B :  I don't know , just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them . Yeah .
C :  Or sort of our work on setting this up . Yeah . Well , is it uh okay I'll just go through your system then . The the room uh
C :  is fairly institutional , but um the main thing is , I think
C :  um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know , as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just a
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ?
C :  d debating
C :  Yeah , yeah but that's just the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know .
B :  But I don't I don't think it means the room as in this room . I think it means like you know
C :  Oh , oh right right , oh right okay room for creativ Oh right I just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room . No , of course , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Room .
B :  Oh yeah . Well I dunno do you th I think it means um I think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so
C :  Sorry .
C :  Huh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah I th okay on th um yeah dif answering the question uh in those terms I'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
C :  So what do we do . We're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual
B :  Okay .
A :  You feel like you're caged within whatever y It's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . The constraints do come in very fast .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah within the constraints the
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah . So
B :  Okay uh do you know what , actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , I think . Yeah . So still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is Craig .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um I agree with his point it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yep .
A :  I think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , so time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure . Because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  And I guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , I think that's a very big thing , and I think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts I feel it 'cause I wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . I feel like I'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , sure .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  New creativity .
C :  Yep .
C :  Right .
B :  So you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or
A :  Not not so much an atmosphere , the atmosphere is very relaxed , but the the gear yeah you know that creates boundaries to that um and and the time the time given also restricts
B :  Yeah , but actual environment ?
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Very good . Um what about leadership ?
B :  I don't know if that means like , if I did a good job or something . I don't really know .
C :  Yeah , well well I mean my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement
B :  From like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ?
C :  Yeah from and you as well I think , just sort of acting as team leader .
B :  Okay .
C :  Um yeah I think I think it's I think it's good . I mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and
A :  Excuse me .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  you know , innovative thought with . In in reality I think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within . And so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so
B :  Uh-huh , okay .
C :  But it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . It turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free
B :  So you think maybe a little too controlling or
C :  Yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt .
A :  I think controlling is not the right word , I think the interactions are very structured . I think structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling . I don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way . It doesn't tell you , you know , some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the
C :  Yeah maybe not co confining .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B :  Uh-huh .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
C :  Mm . Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Yeah .
B :  Okay , uh what about teamwork ?
C :  Um did , you wanna comment Craig ?
D :  Uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  If we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Fully agree .
A :  I think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate , but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email um it it doesn't have a , you know , a messenger will go .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Did uh did you guys get the email I sent you ? Oh that's alright . I was wondering if that got there okay . Okay , um so um to s to to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Not just yet .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , got the email .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , in it
A :  I think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , I think that's the word . They don't support the team working together , you know , they're still very individual tools .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm , exactly .
B :  Oh right , okay .
C :  Yeah , I mean if you
C :  Yeah , I mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way I see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation I I don't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different ,
B :  Mm .
C :  but um yeah , but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept , and we sit here together and do it , well that's what teamwork is . To s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork . Um not that we haven't done I think the best we could have done . I'm not dissatisfied with it .
A :  We had Play-Doh fun .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Right , uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ? Okay , um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ? Um did anybody think anything was like really useful , anything was pretty un f
A :  No , not really .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  unsupportive ?
C :  I think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing I would use all the time , but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text .
B :  Mm .
C :  Um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . I know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss and and and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks ,
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  And point at ? Yeah .
C :  we're just we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . It wasn't until we had this here , you know , like at one point I peeked across and looked at Craig's paper and I'm like , now I know what he's thinking 'cause I saw his book .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Ah .
C :  But the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um
B :  So do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ?
C :  Think could be , yeah .
A :  I think um the the focus of it a lot was the PowerPoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , and I think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things I think . It will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the PowerPoint , or maybe the whiteboard and the PowerPoint in the same place , you know in the centre of the
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , because the PowerPoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , whereas I can imagine if I'd been encouraged to use Paintbrush , for example , or whatever , I would've actually used it , um 'ca you know , just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time .
B :  Alright .
B :  Okay uh
A :  I think that there were too many PowerPoints in the meetings . 'Cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that . And a lot of the information on the PowerPoints , I don't think , you know , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , especially my slides , I felt that they just you know as opposed to having to present them .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  No , not quite .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  What about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ?
A :  Yep clunky . Agreed .
C :  Sure , yeah .
D :  Oh they're a bit clunky .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yep .
B :  Clunky , okay . Um
C :  Mm .
A :  Having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , 'cause you're half way through a thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump .
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I know , I think at the very start of today I like wrote a whole load of stuff , didn't click note on one , then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , and so I'm quite worried that I've just written over the top of it or something , but they'll have my paper anyway um and haven't done that since .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Hmm .
A :  But I think the pen is v is very intuitive , everybody knows how to use it , we don't have to worry . So I think the pen's good . It's about the best thing .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  And o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files .
B :  Yeah .
C :  It just occurred to me that they all
A :  Yeah we only needed one computer and
C :  We only actually needed one computer .
B :  Yeah , that's true .
C :  If there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time .
D :  Good point .
A :  And the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know , it's useful but
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ?
A :  I think too many computers are just distracting . Um
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  I know I I like to have things written down in front of me actually , like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me I ended up you know like writing down there or something so I could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , um I don't know about anybody else .
C :  Mm-hmm . Yep .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um what else uh any wh I do I'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found . Um I don't know is could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ?
D :  Is this for the project or
C :  Well , the w main one for me is that uh the process
C :  na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other .
B :  Mm . Yeah if we just had uh
C :  So , that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah I I dunno I think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about The only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , I thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there but um yeah .
C :  Oh yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B :  I really thi i I think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c just to have like something written down , just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings , but
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  There you go . Um so in closing , I haven't got my five minutes to go . Thin Oh there it i Five minutes to go . Wonderful . Okay um are the costs within the budget , yes they are . And is the project evaluated , yes it is . So now celebrate .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Great . So it
A :  And we have Ninja Homer .
C :  So now we
D :  Oh yeah .
B :  Well apparently now I write the final report . What are you guys doing now ?
D :  Do we know what the other ones are ?
C :  I I don't know .
B :  You dunno ?
D :  Oh wow .
C :  Hmm .
B :  That is lovely .
D :  Hey yeah , I said Ninja Homer .
C :  What did you call it ?
A :  Ninja Homer . See it looks like Homer Simpson
C :  Huh , huh . Logo .
A :  but it's electronic so it's made in Japan . Yeah it's just a logo .
B :  So is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ? Just a logo and then like Ninja Homer , right okay .
C :  Huh .
A :  Ninja Homer .
C :  Mm .
A :  The the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I think it's quite nice .
C :  Fashion technology or something .
A :  You can wear Homer , you can throw Homer when you're frustrated , doh .
C :  Hmm , hmm , hmm .
B :  Oh no , that's cool , it's got I'm kind of I'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , I think that would have been nice .
C :  Hmm .
A :  It's clunky .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Ah well , maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Oh , I did learn something new , Play-Doh is useful . No it is it is . It is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative . 'Cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for . Like we were playing with the Play-Doh and the ideas came with the Play-Doh rather than with everything else . You might wanna write that down . It's just , I'm just fiddling with the Play-Doh , and I'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Play-Doh s
C :  Huh .
C :  Huh .
B :  Really ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Did they ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Play-Doh .
C :  No , it's true , yeah .
D :  Guess I'd forgot how good s Play-Doh smells .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah , it smells funny doesn't it . Um
C :  And some Play-Dohs are actually I think edible aren't they ?
A :  No , all Play-Doh is edible .
B :  Yeah like the stuff for I think it has to be , yeah .
D :  I think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds .
A :  It's just wheat , it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh
C :  Wow , hmm .
B :  Yeah um so to wha what are your summarising words about Play-Doh ?
A :  It's helpful to the creative process . Um it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . And it helps you to understand
C :  Huh .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yep .
C :  Taste .
A :  dimension as well . I think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up , whereas on a piece of paper , on a computer , on a board , um even with a three D_ graphic thing it still , it requires a lot of yeah tangible , that's a nice word . It becomes tangible .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm , yep . Yeah .
D :  Yeah it's not very tangible .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Tangible .
B :  Okay uh
B :  Mm . I don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss .
A :  Nope .
B :  That that's about it really .
B :  Just sit still I guess for a little while .
C :  Do we retreat to our , to continue our
A :  I think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate .
B :  Um
C :  r reporting or what i
B :  Well I dunno . Um I'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now .
A :  Can we turn off the microphones ?
B :  Yeah , yeah if the meeting's over then yeah I guess so .
B :  That should hopefully do the trick , um .
B :  'Kay . Sorry about the small delay . Falling a little bit behind schedule . And that's uh fifteen twenty five .
B :  Okay . So just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um
B :  we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it ? Uh The new black , I believe . Um something that looks good 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , though we should never avoid functionality , of course . Uh many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip and we were still very much for the idea of using an L_C_D_ display . Um other things were we were hoping to use rubber , most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera .
C :  .
B :  Okay . So um due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , and uh show us the prototype .
A :  Okay , it's a
B :  Quite how the best way to do this is , I'm not sure , but
A :  I think if we both step up and uh
A :  outline our ideas .
A :  Okay . Now
A :  do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . Um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh L_E_D_ . As it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit for uh
B :  Okay .
A :  ju just a thought . You could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick that could then just be turn uh twisted round , so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . But as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand , the L_ uh the L_C_D_ is nowhere useful , so that would need to be articulated
A :  uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design .
A :  Um now I I got your note about uh keeping the cost down .
B :  I'm afraid yeah . We'll go into that a bit more , but please go on .
A :  Yeah .
A :  this design could be done with um
A :  with uh plastic casing . Though I would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . As for the um
A :  as for the single curve ,
A :  um well this edge and this edge , like I say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , but it's not absolutely necessary . Really the curve that's most needed is the underside so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this .
A :  Um and you have
A :  the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder .
A :  So .
A :  Any further comments ?
D :  Um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , because it's gonna be flat on one side , so the L_C_D_ will be s sticking down like this , won't it ? 'Cause it you can't get it curved .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
D :  Uh because of costs . And it's plastic as well , so it won't be as comfortable on the hand .
A :  Yeah , I mean the uh Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand . One nice wee feature if we could if we could still do the rubber , I though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of the rigid substructure . So it has a wee sort of tail that you just drape over your wrist so it stays in position nicely .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Lovely . Um .
D :  Yeah , .
B :  Okay , yeah . Great . Um .
C :  Right .
C :  Yeah I've got a if you load up my evaluation document .
B :  Yeah , okay . Excellent work .
A :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
B :  Um .
C :  Uh evaluation .
C :  Basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . Um then we will it's a seven s um seven
C :  seven step kinda evaluation process . So um not seven steps , seven scale . So after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , we average that and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype . And uh the criteria based on Real Reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those I put together from the user requirements phase . 'Kay . Um if you flip the
C :  So , those are the criteria . And uh perhaps I could have put 'em a bit better , but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points . Put it mildly . So we have um true ?
C :  One , t
C :  Seven , eight , oh .
C :  Fourth . Okay , so we have to go through each point . If we imagine it's actually straight , and just give it a a score . So um how well would you say the prototype is uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . I mean , uh is the homing thing still the locator , is that still
A :  Yeah , that's still part of the design .
C :  Sure . And Adam , we can keep that in ?
B :  Yeah , I believe so . So I mean I don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element , but I'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have .
C :  Okay .
C :  Sure .
A :  Mm .
C :  Sure .
A :  Mm . And making it a bright colour helps with the personally I would have gone for purple .
C :  Mm . Bright colour . So we still have that noise thing , yeah ? Os on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I'd say number one .
D :  One . Yeah .
C :  Number one ? Okay . Number number one for the first criteria .
A :  I think w if it was just the sounder then th I mean something I've found with uh w w with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is .
C :  Yeah you can tell what room the mobile is
D :  What about what if the the volume on the T_V_'s turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote .
D :  Suppose you have to go to the T_V_ and do it manually . Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Um
C :  Yeah .
D :  Like y you wouldn't hear the speaker .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  just before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we'll do is
C :  You wanna say something ?
B :  um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , and then we'll come back to the product evaluation if that's alright . Yeah , is that
C :  That's fine .
C :  Oh that's that's fine .
B :  Um so is there anything here that you
B :  that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? And then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this .
C :  What do you mean cr is there anything I wanna
B :  I is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? Or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ?
C :  Um , a few .
C :  Something I neglected from my initial research is that Real Reactions has a a goal strategy that all of the products be inspired by material fashion , and clothing fashion . That is why fruit and veg being popular in the home and in clothing was important and they want all their products to be somehow inspired by current trends in fashion . So they say we put the fashion in electronics , well they really mean it they they're very big on fashion , so .
B :  Okay .
C :  That's this bit right here . And uh this bit is this one easy to use for visitors or for anybody ? I guess it's just the same as saying easy to use interface , so it's kinda condensed into one . And we can come back to it , you said . So .
B :  Okay . No and which we will do very very shortly .
B :  Um .
B :  Okay . Slight problem we had was that we have an amazing four Euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . Um most of it stems from the use of the L_C_D_ which I think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure because of course we required a chip as well . Um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a L_C_D_ , at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , require more buttons , etcetera .
B :  Or what we did was that we um we as in I as I was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . Um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs and we're just scraping it in , we've got point two of a Euro left over there . So we're just managing it really . Even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick so I've used what I think's appropriate . With any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to .
B :  It blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , for example the possibility of having a U_S_B_ connection is definitely not viable now . Um .
C :  Different languages ?
B :  That should still be viable . We've got an advanced chip , we've got the use of the L_C_D_ . So being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility . Um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here . We do need to try and come up with an idea which could be continued with other people if need be . Um .
C :  Yeah .
B :  We can I can bring the excel up sheet up and uh show you if you wish um . I really think as m much as it pains me is that we might have to go with plastic and some kind of solid design , possibly meaning that the L_C_D_ wouldn't be in this perfect place . It might be s stuck like slightly between what would be good for left handed and what would be good for a right handed person .
A :  Mm-hmm I suppose o one thing that could be done is h is have it um circular and have it s so that the uh the pink actually goes a bit over the pinkie finger . Mm . So that uh th
B :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
B :  It very much is about making concessions , unfortunately . Um .
A :  Mm .
C :  Do you have any data on how much um different prints cost ? I mean can you get the entire thing printed with a design um ?
B :  Um b b b da is you mean on the plastic , or ? Let's have a look . You now have as much information as I do . Um .
C :  .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  So as you can see here , for example , the battery
B :  really not very little choice in that one . We've gone for one of the cheaper options as well . Unfortunately we require the advanced chip if we're gonna do what we're needing to .
B :  I've said single curved . We really do need it to be that way for the ergonomics of it . Um plastic for some reason incurs no cost , which I've had to very much make advantage of , despite the fact that rubber's only got a value of two Euros per unit . Problem comes here as you can see in the interface . Um
B :  if I've read this thing correctly , then we can save point five of a Euro here in that it's not per push button . That might make sense , because then a numeric keypad would come in at um what , four point five Euros , which is an awful lot , so that could well be wrong . Even if we save point five there , it would just mean that we're most likely placing it in actually just gaining a colour for the unit , which has had to be put to one side . As you can see , the use of an L_C_ display um advanced chip and what would determine the scroll wheel here as well because it's an integrated scroll scroll wheel push button that wasn't quite what I think they had in mind with a joystick .
C :  Why would why would that be more expensive than an individual push button and scroll wheel together ?
C :  That's quite significantly expensive .
B :  I that's something you'll have to take up with the bean counters . Um
C :  .
A :  Mm . yeah .
B :  as you can see I mean that's taken up well over half of the price . So um I'm very much open to suggestions of where we go , but because we need to shed what was four Euros off of the um the price of for what we really desired , this one comes in under price as you can see , but this was the one that sacrificed the material for the case and for the actual case design .
C :  Yeah .
C :  We don't even have uh speakers here . The like uh we uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? Have we factored that in ?
D :  Mm .
B :  Uh no , we haven't , not
C :  Transmitter , receiver , speakers . Plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a T_V_ . Is that gonna be a button , or
B :  That'll it literally would just be a button . We might have to
C :  Yeah .
D :  That's too expensive isn't it ?
B :  It looks like almost nothing
B :  Mm . Oh good call , I missed that .
C :  I I mean it's not on here , but um .
B :  that's a very valid point .
C :  Did they s do we have to use an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ ? Okay . Well that's yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So if we're gonna go with the L_C_ display , then that's
C :  What's a hand dyna dynamo ? You have to wind it up ?
B :  I believe so , yeah .
B :  That would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such , yeah .
C :  Technology . Yeah .
D :  Fashion .
D :  So basically the only new thing is the L_C_D_ on the remote now .
C :  Okay .
B :  Being manipulated by the joystick , yeah .
D :  Oh , and joystick , yeah .
B :  Which I'm defining as scroll wheel . Um .
C :  And we couldn't replace the joystick , right ? Because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , and that would be more expensive than a but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ?
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , that
B :  that's what I've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation .
D :  So
D :  The L_C_D_ basically is the big selling point of
B :  If we remove the L_C_ display , we could save ourselves
D :  the remote .
B :  a fair amount .
B :  Which you could
D :  But that's what makes it uh original though , isn't it ?
A :  Mm . I think if we remove the the L_C_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah . Um . Uh k
B :  It's a shame . We should possibly have
B :  If we could've increased the price we could've manufactured that and we could've got something far closer to what we were hoping to .
C :  Does this does this bear in mind that I mean it's a bit ridiculous that they're gonna charge us
C :  what is it , like this much money for three million if we're gonna buy three million components , you know .
B :  Again , you'll have to argue with the accountants on that one . Um but for the purposes of this meeting , I'm we're gonna have to stick with these figures .
C :  Mm .
C :  'Kay .
B :  So ,
B :  I would say that it would seem like the general opinion is we're gonna keep the L_C_ display 'cause it's about what really separates us , despite the cost it's gonna incur . Um
C :  I think so .
B :  are people maybe not happy with , but are willing to go ahead with this in going for a plastic solid case , to keep the L_C_D_ ?
A :  Mm-hmm . Um yeah I mean one thing , I mean ho uh how much extra would it be to to keep I mean keep the um the articulation ?
B :  It's hard to tell . Um I would say that you're at least gonna take double curved , and even then I'm not quite sure if that's incorporating the idea of articulation .
A :  This is what I'm wondering .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Oh no , I think I I it d that it needn't require it to be double curved .
D :  It can be s yeah , it can still be single curved , but
A :  It's uh it's just it's just it's just that the case would come in t would be made in two parts and then joined together with an articulation .
D :  You just .
B :  Single curved with articulation ?
C :  Could we could we not get rid of the curvy the curvous the curvaceousness and focus on the menu being the best interface ? 'Cause like we do we have re restrictions on software ?
D :  That's what we need for the joystick I think though .
C :  Oh but there has to be
A :  Mm . Yeah , I mean and I mean the uh I mean if you look uh if you look closer at the uh at the prototype here , the lines here along the grip
A :  are actually quite straight . Um I mean yeah , on the on the L_C_D_ I mean although we've done it with a curve it could just as easily be done um without curves . The curve that's really needed is up here , to put uh to keep the joystick in a good ergonomic position for it to have it rest on the top of the hand .
B :  But the curves all o over hand , is it ?
C :  joystick .
C :  Okay . Sure . Okay , my bad .
B :  We wouldn't actually save a lot by reducing it anyway , so I mean for the purposes of this meeting maybe we can state that single curve still allows articulation . Um unless we hear otherwise we could go ahead with that proposal .
A :  Mm .
C :  So I think the product is not gonna perform so well for my criteria .
B :  Which is what we can get onto now . As long as so are we gonna say w we have to keep an eye on the time as well , but we're gonna say um single curved design
C :  Oh , wait a minute .
C :  Sample speaker ?
C :  What is a sample speaker ? Is that somewhat similar to what we want ?
B :  It could well be , but at a cost of
A :  Mm no that's that voice response thing that we got the email about . But I thought it was just completely pointless .
D :  Costs four .
C :  Yeah .
C :  You got a email about voice response ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  I did not , so .
A :  Alright . B i basically it was saying that our labs had come up with a chip that you could , you know , say hello to , and it would say hello back in a friendly female voice .
B :  Okay , yeah we'll definitely won't go with that one .
C :  We won't go with that one , did you say ? I mean I we
B :  Yeah , that's voice recognition , so .
C :  Okay , okay .
B :  Um .
B :  So , okay yeah , battery definitely ,
C :  So it looks like we're gonna get rid of the whole loca locator thing .
B :  It looks like it unless we can manage to put it in under point two Euros , um .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  Maybe even slight well oh yeah , pretty much point two Euros , I'd say . So we'll leave that one for now . we'll just have
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Are we going for a special colour at all ?
B :  It's uh a case of um
B :  I'm uh slightly unsure . One point five of a Euro for one push button doesn't sound quite right . So maybe it's a case of a push button is maybe one or more .
A :  Mm .
B :  Um .
D :  Well I was for a case .
B :  At which point if
D :  Or had you already incorporated that ?
C :  Oh , special colour for the case .
B :  Well you got point five there . It's literally a case of whether or not this is correct . I'm not quite sure if they're I don't think they mean point five Euros per button .
A :  Okay , well l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose . Because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  There we go .
C :  W what's the default colour ? White or black ?
B :  Black's probably the normal colour you'd say , yeah . I quite like that colour that you're fetching there , it's uh definitely for make it glow in the dark even better . So
A :  Or grey .
C :  Right .
A :  Yellow .
C :  Yeah .
B :  will we go with that then ?
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It's not and we can see we'll come back to uh your evaluation which you're probably now going to pan us but there we go .
C :  Sure .
C :  Okay . Okay . So uh
B :  Just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , I'm not sure how much time . We've not hit the five minute mark warning yet , but .
C :  Right okay . Okay .
D :  Think it's ten minutes left .
B :  Ten .
C :  'Kay . Ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost .
C :  Um . Okay . Special colour .
D :  Special colour .
B :  Mm mm four ? Three ? Mm .
C :  Uh uh four .
C :  Three if we're being generous , I feel .
A :  Three . I think we can do three .
D :  Three .
C :  Think we're being generous here with three .
A :  Th the special colour doesn't would I think make a difference . It makes it stand out from you know it's lost in a big pile of crap , it stands out from the rest of the crap .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . Okay . Reduce the number of unused buttons . We're down to t two buttons , is it ?
B :  Okay .
B :  Two buttons .
A :  Two buttons and a joystick .
C :  Okay , so that's a one . You know , where that's
A :  Totally .
B :  Yeah . I'd say we're doing well there .
C :  Okay , that was good . Easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus that's yeah that's good . 'Kay that's we're not doing so badly . Um easy to use oh okay , let's forget that one . Fancy looking .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  As he models the
A :  It doesn't get much fancier .
C :  Sure . And we could do whatever we like with the L_ L_C_D_ . Yeah let's just assume it's a good L_C_D_ display . Maybe I was panicking for no reason .
D :  Are we going one on ? I'd say we go two , 'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved .
C :  Yeah , w maybe you'd be a bit too yeah . There we go . Yeah , that's m
B :  I'd
D :  Wouldn't it ?
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  With the articulators .
D :  With bells on it .
C :  that's that's better too . More accurate numbers . Technologically innovative . Well , we're getting rid of the locator thing which which yeah
B :  Which is a shame .
A :  Mm . I'd give it a three for this for that . Yeah . I mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote , but you see it in a lot of other places .
D :  No need for teletext .
C :  .
C :  'Kay .
C :  Yeah , mobile phones . And y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control , so it's
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  You say three ? I might go as far as two on that . Three .
A :  I'd give it a three .
B :  I'd be tempted with three , yeah .
C :  Three . Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  We'll get panned on the next one , anyway .
C :  Materials that people find pleasing . Sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently .
B :  Yeah , w
B :  It is , yeah . Don't blame them . Um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such . Plastic , it sucks . But it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have .
C :  Yeah .
C :  That's true . It's not a step backwards .
D :  five ? Six ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I'd s I I'd give it a six , to be honest .
D :  Six , .
C :  Yeah , okay let's give it a six . Okay , that's totally thrown everything off balance . Inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . W we could . What colour were we gonna make it ?
D :  Put a leopard print on it .
A :  Well I I I would sa I would say give a s give a selection of colours . Um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype 'cause we had yellow . If I were buying one , I'd go for purple . Leopard print would be cool .
C :  I know , but
C :  But um by this I think it's more a case of fruit and veg ,
D :  Yeah we gotta . I'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that , that's that'd stand out .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Like yellow , yeah . It would also help keep the the product placement s yeah . Is it inspired by clothing fashion ?
D :  Logo , brand .
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm 'kay .
C :  But
C :  Th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing .
C :  Is this like a banana type colour ? Could we stretch no still , it's not shaped like a banana is
B :  Yes .
B :  It's kind o it probably
A :  That's kinda
A :  i it won't be when it's been
C :  Oh is that 'cause it's flat ? What is what fruit or veg is flat ?
A :  budgeted .
A :  I I think s I I think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie . Um .
C :  Yeah . Or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well .
D :  Yellow courgette .
B :  Well I mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , so , what , four ?
C :  Four ? Oh that's it's very ambitious , yeah , um .
B :  Is that being too generous ?
A :  Mm . I'd I'd I don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . Is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions . Um I'd g I'd rate I'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually .
B :  Oh dear , .
C :  Sure .
C :  Inspired by .
D :  Well this this what we're gonna t this is their motto , like . And we're we're not doing well on it .
C :  Yeah .
C :  This is their strategy .
C :  I m imagine we actually had some money invested in this and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks . Might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about
C :  this one .
B :  What would you think yourself ?
C :  I would say I mean it's it's not at all , right ? In any way or shape or form . We didn't m
B :  Well , it's kind of curved and we can make it yellow , and that's pretty much banana like .
C :  Okay , the the yellow banana like thing is I think is okay .
B :  Si it's got a curve to it .
C :  Right five . Is that sound reasonable ?
B :  Am I do you think I'm stretching the uh the use of the banana ?
D :  Yeah , I'll go with five .
C :  Five .
C :  Yeah .
C :  'Kay , so we have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven .
C :  So five , seven , ten , sixteen , twenty one .
C :  Which gives us an average of three .
C :  It's well this would be in the middle . So we it's it's not bad . It's in the good section .
B :  It's not bad and considering the don't pick the pen . Um .
C :  Oops . Sorry . I'm I'm sorry .
B :  Y oh and you've knocked batteries out . Um right okay it's considering the price we had to get this in , to have a positive you know , even based on the four of us being heavily biased , um
D :  'S bad design , that thing .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  it was gonna be quite hard to get anything standing out I'd say possibly , based on
B :  um the the cost features .
D :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Even if we were to increase this entire thing by by seven , we were to go down a grade to to four , we would have to do I mean we didn't we weren't that kinda optimistic too optim overly optimistic . You know like we didn't we didn't add we didn't subtract a whole seven points from these things , so I think we're definitely on the good bit . Even if we gave this one seven and this one seven , that's still only three extra points over seven . You know , it's yeah , we did it w it was okay . It was good .
A :  Mm .
A :  Personally ,
A :  I think given that
A :  the product um
A :  only replaces a single remote control that you've already got ,
A :  are people really gonna shell out twenty five Euros for something that's only marginally good ?
D :  Well , it depends who your who's what the target people are , like you'd say
D :  maybe the fashion conscious
B :  Maybe it's been targeted
D :  women would be going , oh look at that , 's cool , it looks like a it's
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  yellow , looks like a banana , it's cool it's gotta look good in the sitting room .
B :  Hide it in the fruit basket .
D :  Rather than the L_C_D_ whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology it's good , it's got an L_C_D_ screen 's only got two buttons and a joystick .
D :  So ,
D :  which which kind of people would be more
D :  likely to buy it ?
B :  Probably the people technologically . They're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff .
C :  I think so . I mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone , and she's had it for a long time , you know . She uses it to make phone calls and that's it .
D :  .
C :  Yeah . So I think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , I mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , you know . She'd be like is this a remote control , I don't how do you use it , and stuff like that . So even if it is really user friendly to us , but we're used to using menus all the time .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . I s I suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative ,
A :  um for someone who's sort of technophobic , the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . I think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons , yeah .
A :  Um .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But like radical good , maybe .
B :  Okay . Um don't know how lo much longer we've got . At least five minutes I think . Um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . Um .
B :  So ,
B :  we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction .
B :  Does anybody want to um
B :  um do you have any opinions on any of them ? For example um we'll work backwards I suppose . The ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with . Um people made good use of the
B :  uh pen and paper ?
B :  I would say
C :  Wrote nearly a page , but not .
A :  Yeah , got notes and doodles .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be .
C :  I think tracking .
A :  Well I think this is a I think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh
B :  Mm .
A :  of the researchers studying this . It's all p goes into their corpus . Though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um
B :  It must
A :  transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh
A :  computer ourselves .
C :  Yeah , that woulda been pretty good .
B :  It does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes . So maybe this is literally just a way around it . Um I dunno .
B :  How are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ?
D :  Good .
C :  I'd yeah I liked it , yeah .
A :  .
B :  Leadership . As much as can be leadered in this uh thing .
D :  Very good .
C :  I li yeah , top marks .
B :  Um last one we've got is room for creativity . Now , I think we got
C :  Well yeah . We we're not lacking in ideas , you know it's that was not the problem .
A :  Unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along , squish .
D :  We're burs bursting with creativity .
B :  Yeah I think of in the end , ideas that can be used sadly . Not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing . It's a bit of a pity . Um I would have to agree on that . I think we needed a larger budget .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  If you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector , then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is . Because they will pay outrageous cash to
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . I mean I th I mean I think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh
B :  first on the market .
A :  in added expense .
B :  Mm .
D :  And the price was like it was twice the
D :  w assembly cost . And would it have to be twice that ? It could be like coulda had the assembly like maybe fifteen Euro .
D :  We'll still settle for twenty five .
B :  It could even
B :  That's true , yeah . Um I suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at I guess . As to a the costs involved .
D :  Maybe .
B :  But I mean
B :  we've got a a prototype .
A :  Such as it is .
B :  So I dunno , I I think it's gone okay today , considering the information that we've
B :  had at our disposal , and um such .
C :  Maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more
C :  Yeah , to begin with . Yeah .
D :  In the beginning , yeah .
B :  Probably would have mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end , I would have to agree . It is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . Always hard to tell until you know the costs . Um .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Are the costs within budget ? Well , they are now that we have our slightly less than capable product . We've evaluated it , and we can say that we came out with a value of three .
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Actually I want th one thing I would say I mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions and see just how much of a difference the over going over-budget
A :  um m would make to sales .
B :  It's yeah ?
C :  And like response from consumers .
A :  And we could even you know , market two versions .
A :  Wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber .
B :  And then the final one where you get to call it Hal . But we'll go into that later . Right um is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um
C :  Sure .
A :  Yes .
B :  anything they think that's not been covered , before I quickly write up a final report .
B :  Um I dunno , I mean we've got a product . We maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be , but
B :  we've got something we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell .
B :  And of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers . There is a huge market . I mean we've briefly touched on it but we've no more knowledge then there's little we can say on that .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  So um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to and then we can finish up the writing and such .
A :  And I can get my bus .
B :  Yeah ?
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , let's
B :  Uh thank you for your participation .
C :  Thank you .
A :  Thank you .
C :  I was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff . It's like man , we we can't have the locator thing .
C :  And s yeah that's just bad .
C :  Do you think maybe the prices were were made ?
B :  That a question we can ask .
B :  If you leave them on the whole time you get to look like a noodle the whole time .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Is that someone's ?
B :  Is that .
A :  Thank you .
B :  three , apparently .
A :  Hmm . Hmm .
B :  Okay , you all switched on .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yep , me too .
B :  I presume we're good to go . Okay , um
B :  minutes um we decided to use a kinetic charger ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  standard chip , um 'cause it can come in various different sizes , it wasn't uh
B :  uh gonna be a problem factor . We wanted a stand-by function . The case material is gonna be soft , rubbery , changeable . Um buttons with a combination of L_C_D_ and rubber according to the design . Um bright funky designs inspired by fruit , keeping with the hip kind of feel . Um and to try and incorporate voice recognition software into our design until we can find out more about the cost of things like that . Um and the rubber buttons that we'll use will be anti-R_S_I_ . Okay ?
B :  Prototype presentation .
C :  Is that for us ?
B :  I think that would be you .
A :  Yep .
C :  Okay .
A :  Me and William worked on a prototype , and I think William is going to make a p presentation on that .
C :  Yeah , shall I show ? I'll show . Though do you do you wanna do you wanna sh do you wanna hold it and I'll I'll show you the presentation . Can I just nick your
A :  Yeah .
B :  Make sure the camera's
A :  I can hold it like
A :  Yeah , so
B :  Yes , yes you can . Wait a second , I'll get it out .
C :  Whoa .
A :  It looks
B :  Um
C :  Going a bit crazy over here .
A :  crazy .
B :  Okay .
C :  Thank you .
A :  Um not now .
B :  You should have one of those things and you can just take it off . Ta-da .
A :  Oh .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Oh , where are the hinges ?
C :  Okay , so this is our look and feel presentation , the final our final presentation . And we'll first look at the exterior of what we've uh come up with over there . Um
B :  Right .
B :  Mm 'kay .
A :  'Kay .
C :  It's gonna have a a plastic body um with a sort of standard colour , either we're thinking some something fairly neutral like a a white or a light blue or something . This is underneath the rubberised the rubberised uh outer casing um which there'd be sort of a wide choice they would be attached , but we can we can come up with that . Um the um wide choice of colours and sort of patterns , so you've got you've got a lot of customisation with it . Um it's obviously an a sort of clam-shell design and uh the um the top L_C_D_ screen that you can see that would b would be sort of um
A :  You able to look ?
A :  Yep .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  .
C :  how do you say , it's yeah yeah , it would be sort of inset into the into the top and the buttons at the bottom would d so so it'll fully close flat . Yeah , yeah . And working on the inside we've um already said d decided on the kinetic batteries , which actually , thinking about it now , could y could also probably attach to the flipping open and shut as well , so that you could probably get a bit of
A :  The black and white touch screen wherein people can
B :  Mm . So it's flush .
A :  Right .
B :  Oh right , okay , yeah .
B :  So put it in the top section rather than the bottom sections , 'cause it's the top part that's okay .
C :  Yeah . Yeah . Um we decided that um the voice recognition system , it did actually say on the email that they were sort of coming in and they were fairly easy to get a-hold of , so we presumed that they'd also be quite cheap . So you'd have something like where you'd shout out , where where is the remote and
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  it'll shout back , I'm here , or something .
D :  Or something .
C :  And then yeah . It wo it won't shout out I'm here or something . It'll just shout out I'm here , or something to similar effect . Uh yeah , if it was going like I d well tha that could be something for next time , maybe . You can have a remote that tells you exactly where it is . Um the standard , there's be a standard transmission with the T_V_ using using all the standard chips that we've talked about . Um it would it would have obviously 'cause it's split over two two different layers , it would need two separate P_C_B_s , so it would be joined at the hinge through some sort of cabling . And uh because , obviously , all T_V_s use this , the same infrared medium , we'd just be using using the same thing to transmit the data . And the infrared
B :  Okay . I'm under the sofa .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Ah oka
B :  Or , that would be too complicated .
B :  Infrared .
C :  um sender would be on the on one of the bot the bottom layer , just at the front of the we haven't I don't think we actually put it on .
B :  Like here .
C :  Yeah , yeah , something like that .
B :  Okay . Actually , no , it would be it would have to be on the on the front . Oh right , yeah , okay , yeah , I've got you .
A :  Infrared could be here also . Yeah , here .
C :  Yeah , on the front on the front side of that , yeah .
A :  . So when it's even if it's open here , the signals would go . Yeah .
B :  It's still pointing , yes .
C :  So when you've actually got it open , it would be facing the T_V_ . And then finally um on to the interface . The top screen , as we said , is would be an inset um black and white L_C_D_ s touch screen which yeah would
B :  Yeah , that would make sense .
A :  This one right here .
C :  uh have all of all of the the available functions for for the remote on it , uh whereas the bot the bottom screen would just contain the standard buttons , like the vo volume up and down , channel up and down , power on and off , and uh things to that effect . And now we've we also decided on the inside , we could possibly either have um some some kind of sort of bezzled
A :  .
B :  Okay .
C :  uh logo on it , or something inset , or maybe an engraving of the logo on the top .
A :  Which is
B :  But not interfering with the outside kind of look of the product once it's
C :  No d not not actually . No , not uh interfering with l the whole look of the the product when it's uh on the thing . And finally that's how we put the fashion back into electronics , as that is that's the company logo .
A :  No .
A :  Look up to it .
B :  Okay .
B :  Thank you very much .
A :  Yay .
B :  Wrapping it all up , okay . Um I've now got evaluation criteria .
D :  Well done .
D :  Certainly .
A :  So this is the one . Sorry .
B :  It's to be presented . Okay .
C :  There you go . .
D :  Logged in ? Thank you . Oops .
A :  Evaluation .
A :  .
A :  Mm um I I think this is chip .
B :  It's quite similar to what it was before , though .
D :  Okay . This stage of the evaluation is really for us as a team to evaluate if we have now got a product specification and prototype design that meets the the criteria that we got from our market research . So this is the first stage of the evaluation . Now , the collection of the criteria , as we saw in our previous meeting , was based on the user requirements and trends found in the marketing reports and marketing strategy of our company . So it's what we've discussed in the last meeting , are we actually meeting those trends and requirements ?
B :  Sorry .
D :  Now the findings that we came up with , just a recap , are here . The criteria that we want in this remote control are a fancy look and feel , technological innovation , it should be easy to use , it should incorporate current fashion trends , and those the two main ones , they were the spongy texture and the fruit and vegetable strong design colours . The design should minimise R_S_I_ and be easy to locate and we were still um uh slightly ambivalent as to whether to use voice recognition there , though that did seem to be the favoured strategy , but there was also , on the sideline , the though of maybe having a beeper function .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay , so we can come back to that slide , if you don't have a note of those . I'll just show you how we're going to evaluate our own feedback to this , to what we have so far . We're going to use a seven point scale , where one is true and seven is false . We look at each of those criteria that I've just mentioned , I'll call that slide back up , and I will just do a preliminary rating of all those criteria on the whiteboard here . Does that seem clear ? Any questions there ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Ah , it's perfect .
D :  So we're going to look at these crite
A :  Is it everybody is going to evaluate , or just the Market okay .
D :  Yes , we're going to come to w we'll discuss each one and we'll come to a consensus rating between one and seven . Is that okay ? One is true , seven is false .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Right . So I won't write all of that out again . It will just be criteria one , two , three , four , five , six , or A_ , B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ to confuse it with the number rating . B_ , C_ , D_ , E_ , F_ . This is where I realise how tiny I actually am .
B :  Just write small .
D :  and rating .
D :  Actually , it might be an idea , if we each did give our own individual rating , and we could take an average at the end . How about that ? Okay . So I'll just separate the ratings by obliques , and if we go one , two , three , four , we know who's who .
A :  Yeah , so you can
B :  Yeah . That works .
C :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay . Criteria A_ , the fancy look and feel . How do we feel about this prototype model relating to fancy it is a fancy look and feel . One is true , seven is false . My own rating for that would be a two .
D :  One is true and seven is false .
B :  I would agree .
D :  I'll just go this way .
C :  Yeah , I'd uh yeah I'd probably put it uh two yeah , two or three . No , three . Three .
B :  Okay .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Two .
D :  Okay .
B :  I would say two .
D :  Two .
A :  I would say four . Mm-hmm .
D :  A four , okay . Adding those up , we've got a six and a five , eleven divided by four is what ? Uh two and three quarters , it that right . Two and three quarters ?
C :  Mm yeah .
A :  Almost three .
A :  I think yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Two point seven five , there we go . Okay , criteria B_ , criterion B_ , technologically innovative .
D :  I would give that a three .
C :  I'd give it a one .
D :  Okay . Not that you're biased in that it the designer .
C :  No , no , not at all .
B :  A two .
A :  Oh sorry , I I got it wrong . The first one rating , I'm sorry . Can you just make it two ?
A :  The first . Yeah , I I just it the other way .
D :  The average oh , for you ? You want your rating to be a two ?
A :  Uh in
D :  Is that what you're saying ? Okay .
A :  Yep , I just got
D :  So , I'll work out the average for that again at the end . It's a very slightly altered
D :  Okay , and we're just waiting for your rating f
A :  two point f
B :  It's just two point five for that one .
D :  Two point five , okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Losing one decimal place , that's okay .
A :  One is a , seven is false , okay .
D :  So what are you rating for this one , Paw ? Two , okay .
A :  Two .
D :  So that is eight . That brings it down to two , nice and simple , yeah .
C :  Two .
D :  Okay , ease of use . Easy to use ?
D :  Based on what you've said there , I would say a one , true .
C :  Two .
D :  Two .
B :  I would say a two . I would say a two .
D :  A two , okay .
A :  Two .
D :  Two .
D :  I should've said a two to make the arithmetic easy , shouldn't I ? We'll just put almost two , because I'm not gonna get into silly decimal places . Okay . Or we or if we want to really bring it down , we can do later . Um mm now we're looking at it incorporates current fashion trends , now that's particularly in relation to our market research findings about the spongy texture to the exterior and the fruit and vegetable design colours .
B :  One point seven f five . Okay , mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  D_ .
C :  One .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Right . So I'm just thinking , before I give it my rating , you were limited in the use of materials for your prototype here . Is this actually going to be the colours that you would use ?
C :  Yeah , that's
C :  No , no , the the base colour was um white or or like or l sort of a light blue , but the changeable fa faces would uh allow you to get any basically any one of a number of colours that uh th it's full sort of customised .
A :  White . With for the plastic ? Uh blue .
D :  Right .
A :  Any
D :  So we could use any strong fruit and veg colours and that's what we're intending to do . Okay . And the spongy feel is no problem with that .
A :  Right .
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah and
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  No , no , 'cause th that's that's the the spongy feel would be in the rubber that you put round it , that otherwise it's just sort of hard plastic .
A :  Yeah , because you'll be having a
A :  Because of the rubber case .
D :  Okay .
D :  In that case it's got to be a one for me .
C :  Yeah , I'll give it a one as well .
D :  Yep . Everybody ? Okay .
B :  One .
A :  One .
D :  That part was nice and easy . Okay . Uh moving on to does the design minimise repetitive strain injury .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  I don't think we've really touched on that a lot . We've we've discussed it , we haven't really come up with anything that
C :  Mm .
C :  No .
D :  we felt could feasibly reduce that . We've talked about pointers , but the very use of a remote control , if you're someone who's zapping , who's sitting like that , and we found so many people did , how do you minimise that on such a small device ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well the type of button that we're gonna use in the bottom half , the material , minimises R_S_I_ it's meant to . Um
C :  It's meant to be .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  maybe because it's slightl with the size that we've got it's quite small , but with the amount of stuff we're putting on it isn't that much . So maybe because there's more space , it's not kind of moving around trying to
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  hit accurately the buttons in between . It's quite obvious just big buttons . Um
D :  Right .
D :  Right . I think I'm gonna have to be neutral on that and give it a four .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I'd uh I'd f I'd go for a five , actually , 'cause
D :  A five , okay .
B :  Four .
D :  Four and a four okay .
A :  Four .
D :  Twenty one is that twenty one ? So that's four point two five .
C :  Yep .
D :  And finally , last but not least , easy to locate . Now we talked about voice recognition , we talked about a beeper , have we really have the designers come to any dec real decision on that ?
C :  Yeah . Yeah , it was it was uh a voice voice recognition , yeah .
A :  Voice r recognition .
D :  It was the I'm here thing , yep . And are we happy with the costs on that ? That is going to be feasible , cost-wise .
C :  Yeah , yeah , that yeah , that's feasible .
D :  That sounds good then . I'd go for a I ca we can adjust the volume on that , just as we could volume on T_V_ .
C :  Um I think it would r
D :  So if sombody's in the other room or if T_V_s in different rooms , or .
C :  I think it would probably be a a stand it would be a stand it would be quite loud . So it would be s p yeah .
B :  A standard .
B :  It would be .
D :  Right . Okay . You built into the feature .
B :  And if you didn't hear it in the room that you were standing in , then you'd realise that it wasn't in that room , you'd go into another room .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Logical . That's a one for me .
C :  Yeah , one .
D :  One and one , good .
B :  One .
C :  I do realise that we might be being fairly biased , 'cause it is our product , but
D :  So , how do we feel about this ? We've got our our we've got the highest rating of meeting the specifications that is definitely true for two of the uh six criteria there . That is for um incorporates current fashion trends and is easy to locate . The lowest rating we've got , which is really n it's not terribly low , i it's close around neutral is for uh the minimisation of repetitive strain injury . Do we feel on the basis of tha of these evaluation findings that we can go ahead and now produce this as a prototype and market it , or do we have to make further modifications ?
B :  I don't think so .
C :  W I thin yeah , I think yeah .
D :  We happy to go ahead ?
B :  I think we yeah . I think we're set .
D :  Yeah . I think for most of those ratings that it's high enough at the upper end of the scale for us to go ahead with that , and I really doubt if
D :  on the basis of current technology and our current capabilities , we could actually do much more to minimise that .
B :  Do much apart from having a huge big
C :  Mm .
D :  I know . Okay . Well , I hope that's uh clear to the team . Is there anything you would like to to ask me about the findings before I
D :  sum up ?
B :  Don't think so .
C :  No .
D :  Good . Fine then . I'll just leave it there . Oops .
B :  Okay , thank you .
B :  Okay , I've got finance here now . I'm gonna plug this in so you can all see it , if that's okay .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Oh yes .
B :  Um .
A :  You want me to b unplug that ?
A :  That's all . Yes .
B :  Thanks .
B :  Right .
A :  Okay .
B :  Now I presume
B :  that the screen will go blank ,
B :  that um
B :  Okay . We just type numbers into this and we come out with the final value . So are we still on for kinetic ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
B :  Okay . See , it woulda been handy to have this at the beginning . Um it might have influenced our choice .
B :  Right , what's happening with the electronics ?
C :  It was a regular chip on print and
A :  Chip on print .
C :  Oh , no , no , no , the um
B :  Double-curved .
C :  Yeah , it's you you've put in three for the number of kinetic cells , there should just be one .
C :  In the top , it's the number of c yeah .
B :  Oh , right , okay .
B :  Thanks .
C :  Yeah , and yeah , just a no , one reg v uh
B :  So , would there be two ?
B :  One chip .
C :  Yeah , one of them and one sample sensor and sample speaker .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yep .
C :  And they're double curved . No . Y
A :  Single-curved .
B :  One double curve .
C :  Two , 'cause it's two .
A :  Two curves , yeah .
D :  But it has a slightly flattened bottom so it can sit . So it can rest .
B :  So what's a single curve then ?
C :  Yeah , I'd say I'd say it was w yeah , I think I think it's
D :  It would just be a flat bottom with one curve . like a domed thing .
B :  So just one double
D :  Mm .
C :  One double-curved .
B :  Yeah . Um
A :  .
C :  And one no , 'cause one yeah , one's double-curved , and then the other one's
A :  Plastic and rubber .
D :  The other curves at the sides , but it's slightly flattened at the bottom so it doesn't roll over . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Um we've got plastic and rubber , haven't we ?
C :  a plastic .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Plastic one and maybe rubber point five .
C :  And special colour .
B :  .
A :  No I think rubber , since it's being used just as a casing , we can put point five .
B :  Um
C :  Yeah .
B :  Do you think ?
A :  Yeah , because there are
A :  I think it allows the point five , yeah . We can use that .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  What does it mean if you put point five for that ?
A :  It means we are not using a lot of rubber actually . We're using just
B :  It would be like saying we're using
A :  a very low quantity of rubber compared to plastic .
B :  See , it says case material .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So we're not actually using plastic in the case , are we ? It's including , it's including .
C :  No , no , that's it's as an extra .
D :  Right , okay .
C :  So that shouldn't that shouldn't be actually on there , because that's not incorporated in the cost of the remote you get .
D :  But it is gonna be part of the total cost , and there's nowhere else we can we can put that in , is there ? There's nowhere else we can code for the the rubber used in the casing . So do we not have to account for it in the cost somewhere there ?
B :  Okay , we'll just put it in as we'll put in as half .
D :  Okay .
B :  Or sh we should just put it in as one , because the plastic is zero anyway .
C :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Mm .
B :  No , we don't step on anyone's toes . Okay , special colour , do we need that ?
D :  Might do , if we go for some of the more exotic aubergines and such like colours .
B :  N yeah , okay .
B :  Interface .
A :  Push-button .
C :  Yeah , the push-button's one and L_C_ display one .
A :  One .
A :  One .
C :  And buttons
B :  Buttons
A :  I think we could change the battery also . Instead of going for kinetic how about going for a standard battery .
D :  Has that not made any d if you click off that square now , has that not made any difference ? Is it oh , it's brought it slightly down .
B :  Has that not gone up ? Oh no , it was seven five it's changed not a lot .
C :  Well yes .
D :  So is is uncurved completely and just actually making the rubber case the curved thing , is that going to make a difference ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uncurved , flat .
D :  Oh , it's not made any difference , has it? . It's gone up again .
C :  No , we'll have
A :  No , it just surprises one .
B :  Oh , it's not calculated it .
C :  No , no , you've got to click off to calculate it again .
D :  Oh .
B :  Okay , there we go .
D :  It's brought it down slightly .
B :  It's not a lot though .
C :  C it might uh you might you might be assuming that that is in Euros . It could be in Dollars . And then it would be fine , because the exchange range would make it about twelve . No .
A :  .
A :  I don't think so .
B :  We haven't been dealin we haven't been dealing with dollars though , I think
D :  Is there anything on the menu
D :  No .
A :  Ri I think it's in Euro .
B :  Okay , so the highest we've got is the electronics here .
B :  and the interface .
D :  If we tr um .
D :  If we moved away from our much loved idea of a kinetic battery and just went with the standard batteries , would that make a huge difference ?
A :  And going to a regular bat
C :  Yeah , the standard , it um it would make one difference . The biggest one would be taking away if you took away
A :  Yeah .
A :  What I feel is , customers never said anything about the battery . It's internal , nobody looks into the battery . But shape and colours , that's something we shouldn't comprimi
C :  If you to
C :  Yeah .
D :  And people are used to buying batteries , they're not gonna say I'm not getting this , 'cause I've got to buy a battery for a remote control .
C :  If if you take away the voice , I I do I don't like to say it , but if you take away the voice recognition , then you've got it .
A :  Where's that special form ?
A :  Mm mm mm .
D :  Should we see what difference it makes ?
C :  Yeah i yeah . No 'cause it's samples sens sample speaker . If you took away that , that'll make it twelve point three five .
B :  Where's the
B :  where's the voice recognition ?
D :  Um
B :  Right , okay .
B :  Well the kinetic is three . If we change it to the battery it's that's minus three .
C :  They n n yeah , but you p minus three plus two .
B :  Oh , right . I keep seeing zero .
B :  Um
B :  We can do it some other way , we can do it doesn't have to be voice recognition . We could do the voice recognition for , you know , business class or something , you know , like an upgraded version . You could choose to have that or not .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Sure .
C :  Yeah . But they but I mean in I don't see why we have to sell it for twenty five Euros now , because they w they were saying they were quite willing to pay more for better product .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But we're still working to um head o
B :  So should we just change the design specification then ?
A :  Make it costly .
D :  We can put in our recommendations . If we if we're working to head office specifications as this is what this project team's working for , we can put in our recommendations for what we've we've found and what we the consensus that we've come to as a result of the meetings . But we need to work to that specification to start with . And I think the voice recognition sounds wonderful , but our object is so distinctive that that in itself is gonna make it easier to locate as a f you know in a first instance . Um as you say , we can offer the voice recognition initially to business class customers and so
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  We c we could s
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , we could say
B :  Okay , we can
C :  Yeah , I s
B :  make the price fit , and then say if we'd had our budget , we would've had this , because it also sets it apart from the crowd . They like their gadgets , they like something that's completely different . It's s something completely different associated with your company . Right , okay , so
C :  And then say we recommend
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  'Cause we've done all the background work to go for that if they want it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So if we take voice recognition out
C :  That'll do it . Twelve point three five . Is it twelve point fif was it twelve point fifty ?
A :  Yeah we are close to the budget .
D :  we are .
A :  Two five .
B :  It's two point five . No , it's twelve point two five .
D :  Are you sure ? Sorry , not meaning to doubt your words there .
B :  Yeah well two , twelve point two five times two is
D :  Right . Are they really going to quibble about ten P_ ?
B :  twenty five , isn't it ?
A :  It's twelve point five maybe , then .
D :  Or point zero one of a Euro ? Which is less than ten P_ .
A :  I don't know what it said fifty percent of the cost . So half of the price would be
B :  I think the agenda one was where the um price was , wasn't it ? No .
A :  I think it is the first one .
D :  That's today's
D :  kick off meeting , .
B :  Twelve point five .
D :  Mm . I thought that's what it was .
C :  Ah .
A :  So we are under the budget .
B :  Well done , people .
D :  So we're okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  So is that uh got us covered for the electronics then ? We don't need something else to take that place ? Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  No . 'Cause that that was just a bought-on extra , you could just take that out
C :  and that would be fine , yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Seems fine .
C :  Yeah , I think that's brilliant .
A :  Except voice recognition , everything is
B :  Right , so we've done that .
B :  Okay . Product evaluation .
B :  We've done room for creativity , haven't we ? Because we've got decisions that we would have made that we weren't didn't feel able to make . Um
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I presume we discussed leadership and teamwork .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah .
B :  um in the sense that
B :  um did you feel like a team ? Or did you feel like uh autonomy ?
C :  Yeah , I'd say , as a team .
D :  Although we had our separate tasks , there was so much interaction , so much that we needed to um bounce off each other . And I've certainly felt heard , listened to in that in relevant areas we've been able to , you know , give and take and adjust our remit where necessary .
A :  I think we had a nice time .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Find out from each other , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , I think there was uh very constructive feedback by everybody . It's not like people trying to cut each other . There is more of uh true cohesive teamwork . We came to a very predic creative design , yeah .
A :  Yeah , and uh
A :  Yeah , I think . And Sarah , you coordinated the work very well .
B :  Thank you . How did you find it ?
C :  Yeah , no , I thought it it went really well and I yeah , I I feel that everyone was listened to and all the points that were raised seem to have been sorted out , although we didn't quite make the voice recognition in there , but that's that's good . I think it would have made it into the final product if it was actually if if if we'd seen the marketing before the initial specification was put out , I think maybe it would've come out a d little different , but yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . I liked the fact that we could say an idea and it'd be suggested that that wasn't the best idea , but no one felt like shot down , you know , y it didn't matter it saying what you thought , because if it wasn't something that was that relevant , then it didn't matter , 'cause it was just another idea in the field . I like that . Um
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  teamwork . Well you two created that wonderful specimen of a Play-Doh model .
C :  Yeah , well .
A :  I think that was the best part of the
B :  Um uh I'm still not caught up . But that's nothing to do with the teamwork at all . Um
D :  Maybe we should think of branching out into children's toys and fake mobile phones as a side line . And fake R_C_s .
B :  Maybe .
A :  'Kay .
B :  No , that was quite fun . Um means , whiteboard , digital pens , etcetera , what does that mean ? Any ideas ?
D :  How do we evaluate the materials we had for communicating and sharing information ?
C :  Discuss which ones yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Could it've been better , was it adequate ?
C :  Yeah , I think I think we probably woulda used the outer email system more , had we actually
B :  Had time to kind of
D :  Mm .
C :  had had more time and if we'd been separated more .
B :  Yeah , 'cause we could just sort of say , sorry what did you say about that or what do you think about that , rather than having to email it , yeah . But it was nice having it there .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um like the whole picture of the thing .
A :  Yeah , moving around the room . But I think it's good , like uh we spent times individually .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I never thought of a remote control with a flip top .
B :  Yeah , I think it's new ideas in general , rather than
D :  It's really borrowing from other areas , it's , you know , bringing things from other areas in , it so it's I mean nothing is new , but it's applying it to a d in a different area .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Vegetables .
A :  That's mine .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , no . Well they have to come from somewhere , don't they ?
A :  Yeah , it's
D :  Absolutely , yeah .
A :  The thing is
B :  And as sh as w sorry , you go . Um as was shown by your presentation with all of the other controls , remote controls , no one's thought about it particularly . I mean they're slightly different , so if someone's been shut in the room and said make ours a bit different from everyone else's , 'cause it's w something we should think about , but obviously no one's put any great deal of thought into it .
A :  Yep , sorry , go on Sarah .
C :  No .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , I do I don't think the the companies are really concerned . They're just like we've got a D_V_D_ player , does anyone remember the remote control ? Can't you get the one that we used for the last one ? Yeah , just jazz it up a bit . Uh d they don't really think about it , because normally , the remote control isn't the product which they're trying to ship . They're trying to ship the D_V_D_ player , the video player , the T_V_ .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , the focus isn't on to that , yeah .
B :  But then when it everything is really smart , and you've just got this big chunk of black thing sitting on your coffee table , it doesn't go , I mean if you could have something that's a proper funky thing , a funky item that's individual , individual to you , I mean they could even go into um you go in with an idea and they design it on Photoshop and then they just get it printed on the plastic , you would pray you would pay a lot extra , because it's individually being a plastic was being made for you . But people could have anything that they wanted .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  No .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Surprising to me is like uh people give a lot of attention to modifying mobile phones , like a real want to see a new launch or something like that . And new f television products coming up , but nobody giving uh much idea to this . Like Sarah was telling , everything's
B :  Because of the produ
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I think it's really good that this has been very market research based , because just going back to mobile phones , I mean this is the first change in remote control devices that I can really , you know , say is is obvious and visible . We see it in mobile phones a lot , and tha that's where we've borrowed a lot of our ide our ideas from . There are innovations in that that people don't really want . I see people wanting a model of the phone they were really happy with , and they can't get it anymore and it's innovation for innovation's sake , and I think it's wonderful our company's so R_ and D_ based .
A :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well , it's innovation for money's sake . The the people have to keep buying . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah . But forcing it onto people , yeah . It's things that , you know , they might want to buy the thing they really want .
B :  And you can't get you've got your handset that works fine , but you can't get the battery anymore for that type of phone , because the phones have moved on , things like that . Yes .
D :  Mm . Mm .
D :  Or there isn't a cover to fit it or whatever , yeah .
B :  It's madness . Um
D :  See I think
B :  In closing
B :  There we go . Um our costs are below budget with recommendations that they the budget be increased , but I think I don't know , d what do you think ? Do you think that's takes into account um
B :  like us being well paid kind of a thing ? And the heating for the building , do you think our budget includes everything , all the costs that are going out ?
C :  Well .
D :  I think it was just the produc uh just the production cost of the phone .
C :  I think that was just the the physical .
B :  So it looks well it looks like it's gonna be fifty percent profit , you've still got all of the overheads to come out of that . So maybe increasing it , you would also have to increase the price that it's sold at . But I think but you were saying that that's quite
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe fifty percent more .
C :  Yeah , I think yeah I don't from the market research .
D :  But I think in the remit that we were given , it was very specific . I think we've done what we were required to do , and I think there'll have to be another project team or a new project for us to look at at those kind of things . I don't think that's something we have to look at and find a way of raising the cash for .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  No .
C :  Yeah , it was
D :  I think we've done very well to get within budget and it still makes such an innovative item that I think people are really gonna want .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  It's a shame it won't ever get made . Maybe it will . Maybe someone'll r run down and patent it .
D :  I know . Maybe it will . Maybe they are gonna steal our ideas and sell it .
A :  Who knows ?
C :  I it's top secret . Um it's it is it's a conspiracy going on here . That's what it is .
B :  Um the project has been evaluated well and truly . Um and we've got the meeting survey and questionnaire . Oh , so we've got about fifty minutes to catch up with everything that I fell behind with , so I'll be delegating in my um role as Project Supervisor , so good luck .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  There's a final questionnaire .
C :  In your yeah .
A :  Celebration , you didn't talk about that .
B :  I think the celebration is the twenty five pounds .
B :  Either that or we'll be dancing on the desks .
D :  Questionnaire .
B :  Oh .
C :  Okay . Is that it then ?
B :  Um yeah , just the last , I think .
C :  Awesome .
B :  I think I've got minutes for two of the meeting and the
B :  last thingy .
D :  Questionnaire done .
D :  Oh , I didn't have to rate you on how much you influenced the meeting this time .
C :  Was that not the questionnaire for the how you felt you'd done in your
C :  thing ?
D :  Oh , right . But do we not sometimes evaluate in these meetings too ? Yeah .
C :  I don't think . Yeah , the the s yeah . I think yeah , questionnaire seven was the one I did just before the meeting .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  I just got con
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay , almost there .
C :  Okay . We'll sta I'll use the PowerPoint , I guess . How was that , was that fun ?
D :  Mm . Very fun .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Uh oh I've forgotten to mail you the minutes , but I will do . Upsidaisy . Um Um we Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Hmm .
B :  E excuse me I forgot my
C :  Alright , okay , yeah .
B :  copy .
C :  He's gonna get his pen .
D :  Oh right . Okay .
C :  Um Will you guys first with your prototype
C :  um before we get to the good news ?
A :  Yeah , there's good news ? Oh .
C :  Uh we have budget problems .
D :  Mm .
A :  Oh .
C :  I'm afraid you're all sacked . Oops . I don't even have this on .
A :  Cutbacks .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Okay , have you got a presentation to make ? No . Okay so it's just your your show .
A :  Okay .
B :  No , not mine yet .
A :  Oh .
A :  Um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see . Yeah .
D :  Okay . Sure .
A :  Okay .
D :  We made three for you .
C :  Three ? Oh .
D :  Um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato and the other one is st
C :  Tomato ? What tomato ? I don't recall a tomato .
D :  Look . Oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . So . Okay , so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , or as mm few buttons as possible , mainly speak recognition . The yellow there is the um the slogan , yeah , that we need to incorporate , it's very simple . If you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , um but mainly it's speech recognition .
C :  Ah I see , okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Logo .
C :  Okay , brilliant .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah and yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . Mm I'm not sure about that . Um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . Yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want .
C :  Alright , okay .
C :  Right .
C :  That's groovy .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well I like the feel of it , I like the feel of it .
B :  Uh can I have
D :  Yeah , sure . Um that one is Oh no , it's delicate .
B :  Oh sorry s
C :  At Oh dear .
D :  That's that's already got its stand that one . That's it stand . It does also lie flat , but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . Um the black on the back is the slogan .
C :  Alright , okay .
C :  Okay , brilliant mm .
C :  Okay , nice and obvious there , if it's standing up , I guess , yeah .
D :  Uh yeah , that Well , we did think of that .
D :  Yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . So um and that's the um transmit the L_E_D_ thing . These are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . We n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed .
C :  Oh right , okay , brilliant . Like that from its centre .
C :  Where you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of
D :  Yeah . Well , if you hold it , you can you all can hold it , is it does actually feel quite ergonomic , if you've got small hands . Um , obviously I don't think that's real sized . It would have to be a bit bigger . Okay . Um that's a speaker at the top , so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , okay . Yeah , scale model , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um and um then the buttons . Yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . Tried to keep it simple . Oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . We used those . And um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . It's not in the traditional place , but um it's quite an obvious place .
C :  Alright , excellent .
C :  Okay .
C :  No . It's out of the way as well , I suppose , so .
C :  Excellent .
D :  So there we go and and um we have the banana-based one too .
A :  Oh yeah , yeah .
C :  Yep .
A :  This one is uh , I suppose for the younger audiences .
C :  Okay , so so Barney the banana .
A :  A a more friendly type of
A :  Right , right . It's to uh induce more television watching I suppose or
C :  Ah excellent , just what we need .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Say it for the camera .
C :  Lo Sort of Loch Ness banana .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right , right .
C :  Cool yeah . Well , nice to have uh options at least . 'Kay and
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
D :  So are there any um improvements or issues or
A :  It won't stand .
C :  Oh there are issues , oh there are issues .
A :  Just let it lie down , it wont stand .
C :  Um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance .
D :  Oh .
C :  Uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . Um unfortunately
C :  the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six Euros .
B :  Mm .
D :  Oh .
C :  So we have to rea Sorry , I've accidentally highlighted somehow Um . There we go .
A :  What's on the uh on the left ?
A :  Okay .
C :  Oh god , why is it doing that ?
D :  Ooh .
C :  There we go . So basically , um in order to save our two Euros
C :  um I was thinking
C :  that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened .
D :  Mm-hmm . More like a traditional remote control .
C :  Um .
C :  Yeah , I mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . And by doing so Oh no , hold on . Doesn't save us quite as much .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I don't know what's going on with this again .
A :  W why is the uh double curved two of them ?
C :  Oh , good point .
B :  And double curve on both sides ?
C :  Um .
B :  Curve . Yeah , this is double-curve , no ? This is double-curve . It This one is single curve .
C :  That's sort of curve in and out .
A :  Is i
A :  Mm .
B :  'Cause this is single curve , this is curved on both sides .
B :  So double-curve .
C :  No , I think it means double curved as in um like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . Okay , I might be wrong though .
D :  Like an S_ shape .
D :  Okay .
B :  Like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . Hmm . Hmm .
C :  I don't think that counts as a curve , I think that's just a shape .
D :  Okay .
C :  A curvature is like the this case .
B :  Maybe .
A :  'Cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right . got two of them
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , and why why I've got it two , I don't know , I can't seem to select any more however .
A :  Okay . Well we can work around that um
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Right . No .
A :  Cut things out .
A :  But you think it should be one .
C :  It's meant to be one , yeah , I don't know why I put two in there , but um Hold on till I find it , I think this shift button might be stuck again .
A :  Okay .
C :  No maybe the shift button's stuck in . Um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Should
C :  Oh that's fine .
A :  Yeah , so we're
C :  Eleven uh eleven Euros sixty .
D :  Cool .
D :  Cool .
C :  Um
D :  So we could even add something .
C :  We cou Oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . What ?
A :  We should fire the accountants .
A :  Fire the accountants .
C : 
A :  Ah yeah , we could add things .
A :  Maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . Does that work ? No mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I know , that just extends it as well . I don't know .
B :  Uh you can do one thing . You just select one box outsi yeah , this box . Then move it with the help of this Okay . Just uh just uh Okay , just a minute .
C :  It One of the buttons is sticking , I don't know .
B :  Okay . No input , like this . Shift . No it's not . Yeah , it's not working . Should we ask Meli Should we ask our technical expert Melissa ?
C :  No , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something .
A :  Is it the other shift button maybe ?
C :  No that's fine . Um we've worked out what it would be anyway .
A :  Did you try both shift buttons ? It could be the other side .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Cancel . Piss off .
A :  That's too bad .
C :  Oh well , never mind . Um .
C :  Right , so that's finances and I dunno what we what could we reckon we could add ?
D :  Well maybe we could add something , but maybe if What do you th We're trying to save money , so . Yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . But if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . Maybe I mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , because it's not in an ideal place right now .
C :  Well I suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . So
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah .
C :  Well that's that's uh Okay , so project evaluation . We have under twelve Euros fifty . Project process , how do we think that went ?
C :  Are we happy ?
A :  Oh .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah I think we have a a winning product .
C :  Okay .
C :  Evaluation .
C :  Oh we've been writing this up for m months .
D :  I think it went quite smoothly .
C :  Uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ?
D :  W I think we were very creative .
C :  No , I mea I think it means sort of individually .
D :  Oh right , okay .
C :  Yes , no , maybe ? Okay . Groovy . So uh we're just gonna . Uh yeah , okay . Teamwork ? Leadership , sorry .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Excellent leadership .
A :  Great leadership .
C :  Thank you very much . You're all get you're all getting a raise . Uh teamwork . I thought went well . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , everyone got enough input , I think .
C :  Uh and well means , yeah . The technical stuff was brilliant . Let's buy more . Uh Right . Um I don't know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest .
A : 
B :  Yeah , we
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  These pens are are neat though .
B :  Yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . We discussed all the new ideas , but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these , but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . These are new ideas we And new shapes , everything . At le Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm 'kay . Groovy . So just general thumbs up for all of us then . That kind of unfortunately is too quick . Uh . I suppose yeah . Um .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Okay . Well um .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this , right .
C :  That's it , um I think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you . Uh Let's see if I can get this bloody thing to work . Whoops .
D :  Mm .
A :  Right , right .
A :  Uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay .
D :  Yeah , maybe .
B :  So
C :  Does it go back in , does it ? Reusable .
A :  Something we should get .
C :  I don't know what this is but it's really really annoying .
B :  So
B :  Uh Brian , have you have you finished ? Uh mine needs also this .
C :  Uh-huh .
C :  Um I have , yes .
C :  Huh ?
B :  At last mine is also the presentation .
C :  Oh right , okay , you've got more , okay . Sorry uh . It didn't bother to tell me that on this
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Oh , you got a presentation , sorry .
A :  Oh ok
C :  thing .
C :  Is it ?
C :  Okay .
B :  Uh is the project evaluated , that is mine .
C :  Doesn't tell me .
C :  Oh you're doing that .
B :  Yeah .
C :  We evaluated ourselves , we thought we were great .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh .
D :  Mm , love to eat that now . Kind of a green banana now .
A :  Anybody
C :  Mm .
A :  Clay covered banana .
D :  It's this as well , sorry , we forgot to mention it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got . I've got .
C :  O okay , hold on .
A :  blue .
C :  I wonder w which cell do I want .
A :  It's fun to touch .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So . Yeah .
C :  Okay , I didn't realise you had that bit .
B :  So .
D :  Oh could you pass the tomato please . Sorry . Thank you .
B :  So now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . How we are going to means uh at what standard what standard whether it meets our standards or not . How mu What rating we will give to these products . So of course this is will be a team work , w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . So what methodology I will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
B :  We will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . Then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? Means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . So this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . Then marketing strategy of the company . As we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Sorry . Sorry , carry on .
B :  Yeah . So but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . So
B :  Now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . I'm having this scale this scale , so we have to do it on a board .
C :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Alright , okay . The board working again , is it ?
B :  the user requirem I think .
A :  Do we have the uh the marker for the board ?
C :  Uh .
D :  Um .
B :  Thank you .
A :  There it is .
B :  So .
B :  So these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . First of all uh comes user requirement . So we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . I I will first I would like to have your views , what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um I think
D :  Yeah , it did . It had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . Um so . Does it work ? Yeah . So .
C :  Yeah .
C :  When the user requirement is essentially just to operate the T_V_ , so yeah , of course we haven't actually got a working model yet .
B :  So what do you think you will personally give . Seven . Uh .
D :  I would say seven . Seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? I can't True or false ? No sorry tr one is true .
C :  One , yeah .
B :  Uh one is means highest ranking , okay . But I think highest ranking is seven , or one ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  No it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth
A :  No that's false .
B :  Okay , right right . So it's one for from your point of view . And what do you say our Industrial Expert ?
D :  Okay , so one .
D :  Yep .
A :  Uh .
A :  It's hard to know . I I give it a two .
B :  Uh d you can you can tell on on the like I think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i Interface Expert . But you can give your views based on technology , whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Um yeah , I think i it might even exceed it um .
A :  But I guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons .
A :  Um I'm gonna give it a two . Two .
B :  Two . And what about uh you , Brian ? You will go for one . Okay . Uh for me personally it is everything fine , it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , but there is one thing which limits the customers , like we are having only two , three designs , like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , and Uh yeah , lower end . And the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . But if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . No , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . So we are showing our preference for particular fruits , two or three kinds rather , and Yeah . So .
C :  Oh , I'll go for a one .
C :  Basic requirements but of the pro of the project .
C :  Yeah th
D :  Mm yellow .
D :  Uh-huh .
C :  Come on that was the tha
C :  'Kay .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  Okay .
C :  Being fruitist .
D :  Is that no is that not trends ?
B :  Uh no , uh personally as a Marketing Expert I don't believe that , because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . Some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . So you can what shape a person will like . So in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . And by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  But in electronics , I think , it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . I think , you know , if you're going to buy a T_V_ maybe a company'll have That you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . We were coming up with one product .
B :  Uh maybe . Okay but I will I will personally won't give it beyond three . So we can
D :  No , I mean uh obviously your opinion , I'm just trying to
D :  Okay .
C :  He's a tough cookie .
B :  Yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe .
B :  Three or four ? Uh , no sorry , it should be
C :  Six . Five or six .
D :  What are we doing ?
B :  No sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , we are doing a very wrong thing . Yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , and that's I have taken it very wrongly . Yeah uh three four four two six seven seven sev Yeah one pe exactly . So we can say one or two . because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two . Yeah . So where were the trends .
A :  What are we doing ?
D :  Adding them up ?
A :  We're gonna average them ?
A :  Okay . So seven fourths . About one point f one point eight .
D :  Oh .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
C :  Oh I see .
A :  Yeah round it up to two . So trends .
D :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Can you explain what you want us to write there ?
B :  Sorry ?
A :  How it how conforms to the current trends ?
B :  Yeah , again the the fashion trends , this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something . Uh .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay . Well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , I would give it um , well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , so I would actually give it a three . Tha three or four , I'm not sure . Three . Go for three . That's fine .
B :  Okay . Yeah . Uh
A :  'Kay . As far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , but it's missing the screen , as we said , um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons ,
A :  um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . So I give it a a four . I'd give it a kinda middle of the road for
D :  Mm .
A :  for technology .
C :  Yeah , I am sort of pret uh Just the fruit does me in , I mean uh it might
C :  it might be trendy to some , but I'm just not swallowing the fruit , so um Uh also uh I would have liked to have seen the L_C_D_ screen in it . Um so yeah I'd say about four as well .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Uh personally I wi uh I think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , like , these products are in fruit shape , because that wha people now our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So and in this way our product is good . And the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . So that is also ef that also Our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . And yes . It is cus spongy also . So they can play with it , it's quite good . So then I think , maybe I can give it two . So four five ten thirteen thirteen . So we can Is it fine ? So what about company strategy ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well it was yellow .
D :  Um .
D :  Yeah , the company strategy , okay . Um there was lot of discussing , that was good . Um I feel I got my say . Um so I'd give the company strategy
D :  two .
B :  Okay .
A :  Well , I think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . Is that the question ?
D :  Okay . Is it ? Okay .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Um .
D :  Okay , so
D :  one or two . One . Okay , just leave it , it's fine .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I'll go with two .
B :  So what about you , Brian ?
C :  Um yeah , a three .
C :  Pretty much kept to the company strategy , so I would go for a
C :  a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , and me also , like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . So since our product meets all these requirements , so I would also prefer to give it rank one . So four six six
A :  So one and a half .
D :  Yeah , one .
B :  half . So we can say two or one Okay . So th seven seven .
A :  A two .
B :  Uh overall we are getting two something , but we can round it as two .
A :  Yep .
D :  Okay .
C :  Cool , groovy .
B :  Yeah . So I think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . So we can launch it . Yeah .
C :  Cool .
D :  Woo-hoo .
C :  Brilliant .
C :  In which case we are done .
C :  'Cause we've evaluated and we are within budget .
A :  Okay .
D :  Cool .
B :  So yeah . Great .
C :  Champagne lunch anyone ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh .
A :  I'm proud of it .
C :  Okay . This is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting .
C :  And again I'll take minutes . The what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Um then
B :  It does look very cool .
C :  then Cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . Then I need to say some st a few things about finance , 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . Um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from Cat and the financial limits . Um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . So we've got forty minutes . S
B :  And then do we get to make a remote control ?
C :  'Cause we missed out .
B :  Yeah .
C :  it's now I guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , so we've got until four
C :  fifteen .
A :  Uh-huh . How how much do we have , forty minutes ? Yeah .
C :  Is that right ?
D :  Yeah , about four fifteen , yeah .
C :  Yeah , until about four fifteen . So yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so .
C :  Go for it . Do you want
D :  So , you said um are are we starting with the the so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things and and then I will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and
C :  Yes .
A :  Presentation .
A :  Okay . Okay . So um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . Um
B :  You think bananas are a safe thing to use ? It's a bit um phallic .
A :  Yeah . Um
D :  Well , but it's it's just an a approximation .
C :  Dual use , perfect . Dual use , perfect . Does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? Sorry , sorry .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh , your remote control ? Oh that's just bad .
A :  Um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . So now we we have the okay , so Ma Maarika will explain you the user interface there . And it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . And we have the user interface o in here and uh the the L_C_D_ and and the scroll are inside . Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Wow .
A :  well , everything else is probably user interface , so . Yeah , yeah .
C :  And it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that
D :  Uh yeah .
A :  Oh yeah . Yeah , it has , yeah .
D :  Rubber .
B :  Is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ?
D :  Yeah , .
D :  Um it could be made a bit smaller , and and of course it would be and yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , so we said the back side round , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . I I think it's it's uh
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  It l does look like the curvy and then the whole shape's curvy , so I would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . And it's spongy as well . So so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . So we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . So it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here .
A :  Mm . Hmm .
B :  I wasn't very keen on that , but yeah .
C :  Huh .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Six seven eight nine . I like that .
D :  Yeah . And then , well this is on off button . It's it's quite standard mm place for it and and also the colour is quite often red , so it's it's kind of user friendly . And then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and like the previous one and the next one . And and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  So where's the volume ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  The volume is is scrolling . On the side , this one . Yeah you just do it like this . And and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here .
A :  It's on the side .
B :  Ah , you did get that in then , mm-hmm .
B :  Oh okay , .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  See ? So the volume is you just scroll , but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose . You can move back and forth and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Cool . Oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button .
A :  Uh no , we we'd not put so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials .
D :  A mute button .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display .
C :  Y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you
B :  On the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute .
C :  .
A :  Uh on the L_C_D_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options .
D :  Well , but the but the mute yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ?
C :  But if you hold it in , if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ?
B :  Yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ?
A :  Mm .
D :  Okay , yeah , okay .
B :  Okay , cool . So that that solves the whole mute issue .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . You can't really see it in the interface .
C :  no .
A :  Yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere .
D :  Yeah . And we do have the logo on it as well .
C :  Mm-hmm , very good .
D :  So I think it
C :  And it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours .
D :  Yeah .
B :  .
D :  Yeah , I think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website .
A :  Cool .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  We ran out of resources here , so .
D :  In the actual one .
D :  Yeah . So if you have questions .
A :  You can have a look .
C :  Very good , let's have a look . Test it out .
B :  .
C :  Uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , I guess .
B :  Yeah , oh , we hold the remote . Oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . I hate Play-Do , it's just minging . But yeah , uh that's cool , cool .
C :  Very good . Okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria and then we'll there I suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , but um we'll se I'm sure we can get around them somehow .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , see the budget .
B : 
C :  We'll just send all of our manufacturing to
C :  some nice poor country and
C :  cut some of the prices that way .
B :  Wales .
C :  Wales , for example .
B :  Mm . Cool , okay . Right , okay .
B :  Fabulous , yeah . Okay , cool . So what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design . Um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . Um , you know .
C :  Marketing Expert .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Basically , what I did was I went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . Um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . Okay ? Cool , so these are what they are . Oh
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . Is that right ?
B :  Yes , I did have A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ down here , but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . Okay . But if you can imagine that they say A_ , B_ , C_ , and D_ , then that would be really good .
C :  Mm dots , never mind .
A :  I guess we'll give it maximum points in everything .
D :  Yeah , the yeah , it's definitely attractive .
C :  Yeah , I agree .
D :  Oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot .
B :  Well , I thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the T_V_ ?
D :  Yeah . Shall I just prepare it now ?
C :  Yeah , just prepare one now .
B :  Yeah .
D :  It will be red , too .
B :  Cool . Okay . So , be attractive to look at .
B :  That's this one . What do you all say ?
D :  S seven was th the maximum , yeah ? I I go for seven .
A :  So ?
C :  I reckon it
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Seven , yeah , it's terribly sexy . Yeah .
B :  Oh we're all so proud of the . Okay , so that'll be a seven for A_ . Could oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . Okay um uh what I've done on the next page is I've set it up so we just put the marks in .
A :  Yes .
C :  Ah , okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  Excellent . Except we can't uh we can if we then yeah , I'll take a note , it's fine .
B :  Yeah . But that's alright . If you take a note of them , and then I'll put them in in a minute . Okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for A_ ? Cool , okay . Does it match the operating behaviour of the user ?
A :  But we can we can I can I can take note uh uh
C :  Yeah .
D :  I would think yes , yeah .
C :  I think it does .
A :  Um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger .
B :  Yeah . I mean
D :  Yeah , so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one .
C :  Alright .
C :  But that's gonna be a problem , 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family .
B :  Yeah .
A :  But then yeah .
A :  Yeah . So bu it's it's not a huge problem , because i i it is operatable .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I th I think it's not it's not like it's a pen .
D :  But then then I think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , so they just
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but I mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , but they can normally do most things right-handed , so I would say it's not such a big issue .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
D :  Yeah , because I mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . I mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . So I mean that does kind of negate the whole R_S_I_ issue . So maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , maybe give it a five , I would say ? What do you what do you all think ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Um
C :  Six .
A :  Mm .
D :  Or maybe six , because it's just one one i one among the issues , I mean . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I think I think for um I mean most people are right-handed , so in in terms of our greatest target group , I think it's pretty good , but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to um
D :  Yeah .
A :  One more thing is that i
B :  Okay .
C :  They
A :  It might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , so it opens on the side . So
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  No , yeah , but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah . So it won't be a problem , it will be and it will be it won't be heavy .
A :  Yeah yeah yeah , I mean yeah . So you guys can decide wh whether
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Oops .
B :  I th I think the alternative is flipping from the top .
D :  Yeah well yeah , but it's it's a bit long . It's a little bit long . Well , I mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah .
A :  Yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah .
C :  The length is gonna be difficu
B :  Yeah um
B :  But you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ?
A :  Uh this this kind of uh makes it more and two , it might interfere with the I_R_ channel .
C :  Mm .
B :  Because
D :  S uh slightly smaller .
B :  So you have to keep that side flat .
D :  Yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that .
A :  Okay .
B :  So it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work .
A :  Right .
B :  Okay . Um okay , so C_ . Are are we admitting defeat on C_ or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the T_V_ ? There's a locator . Cool , so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , doesn't it ? To make it beep . Or a buzzer .
A :  Okay .
C :  No , we're gonna put it like we've got th there's the locator dot .
A :  No , we have a locator .
D :  Mm that you stick on T_V_ .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah well w but l but the speak sample speaker is included , so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds , so yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So that's two , so that's seven , yeah . It's locatable ? Fabulous . D_ .
D :  Yep .
A :  Intuitive , completely intuitive .
D :  Yeah . If uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things and it's I th I think it's
C :  Yeah .
C :  I'd say six , 'cause the I mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . I really like the way you have it , but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Intuitive .
B :  Yeah , and I mean d
C :  So
A :  And uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni so it is kind of not very intuitive but uh it's a good technology , I mean once they get used to it .
C :  Might be
C :  But it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So , should we maybe say f a five and say it is intuitive , but it's different , so , do you know , I mean it's obvious how to use it , but you might have to think about it first . So we give that one a five , you think ? Yep .
A :  So l
C :  Five ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay . I'm gonna give a seven in everything , so .
C :  I'm happy with five ? Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I'm glad you're accepting this . It has taken a little while , hasn't it ? Um intuitive
B :  but
B :  Sorry , it's really hard to write on those . I just went a bit mad , didn't I ? Um okay , cool , E_ , okay .
A :  Mm .
B :  Um I would guess this comes back from this whole B_ thing links in here , so possibly for left-handed .
B :  Investigate .
C :  Yep . But otherwise it's superb .
B :  So , should we give it a six ? Six ?
C :  Six .
D :  Um uh the ergonom ergonomic design well mm I mean I d uh I dunno , I mean the the repetitive stress things , but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , yeah ? See .
C :  Yeah .
A :  .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , unless you are a all the time sitting .
D :  Yeah , so it's kinda
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well we've banned them from
A :  Yeah , I I think it is ergonomic .
B :  I used to send fifty texts a day , you know , and I never got repetitive strain injury from that , so I find it quite hard to believe to be honest .
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And moreover it it has um L_C_D_ and everything , so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's varied .
C :  Yeah . Six ?
B :  Okay , so we give that a six , yeah . Okay , F_ .
D :  Yeah , it does have yeah .
A :  Absolutely .
C :  Voice control have seven .
B :  Hang on , how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? That's just
C :  Ah , that's the second one . So you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , but not on the previous slide .
B :  Oh okay , cool . Um right , so .
A :  So it has voice control .
B :  Yes , so that's a seven then . Um , cool .
A :  Yep .
C :  G_ technologically innovative .
A :  Anyway it ha yeah , it's the most sophisticated remote that I ever seen .
D :  Technologi well
C :  But in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but I mean you don't
C :  All of the components have been used in other things before . But do yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote .
B :  They're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before I don't think .
D :  But at the same time they are all they are all relatively new .
C :  Yeah . What do you reckon , five , six ?
B :  .
B :  Yeah , what do you all think ? Six ?
D :  Six .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? It still has to do what i what it has to do .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well , that's it , I mean
B :  Yeah , but I mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? So , I don't think many peop
C :  Space remote .
B :  That's it , they can take it with them .
C :  Put fashion in electronics .
A :  Absolutely . The carrot banana remote .
D :  Yeah , isn't it fashionable ? Yeah , sure .
D :  It's the maximum fashion . Fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so .
B :  So , we give it seven , and we write
B :  There we go .
D :  So I think we've done very well , but
A :  I think that's a .
B :  Cool . So , we need the average here , so we got
C :  Very good .
D :  What's the assessment ?
A :  Yeah .
D :  The average is about six and something . A little bit over six .
C :  Yeah , one .
B :  Seven
C :  Or a seven .
A :  There are how many sixes ? One , two , three . Three .
D :  No , wait , a little bit under six . No , wait .
B :  So we've got four sevens , so that's twenty eight , three sixes , eighteen .
A :  And one five .
D :  Oh , three sixes , okay , yeah .
C :  Fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight .
A :  Okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . Forty six and five , fifty one . Fifty one divided by
D :  Four sevens .
C :  Six point point about six point five . Close enough .
D :  Six point something , yeah .
B :  Two three four
D :  Six point five , yeah .
B :  Seven eight .
B :  Okay , that's pretty good , I think .
C :  Now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it .
C :  That's all you've got at the moment , or did you have anything more ?
B :  Um no , that's it , yeah .
C :  That's it ? Alright . So , finance .
C :  And we'll see if we can
C :  unscrew this first .
C :  Sorry , this is I'm just um
B :  Cool , there we go .
B :  .
B :  There we go and there are the marks .
C :  Beautiful . Not anymore .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Computer no signal ?
A :  Mm I guess it'll have to wait for a bit .
C :  Adjusting .
C :  There we go .
C :  Okay , so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria .
C :  And now we have to calculate the production costs . So I've got an Excel spreadsheet to help us do that .
C :  Can you read that ? Almost .
C :  More or less . Um I started filling it in , but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . No hand dynamo , right ? One simple battery . No kinetic energy , no solar .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  The chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . We also said the sample sensor and sample speaker .
A :  Advanced , yeah .
D :  Yep .
C :  Um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it .
D :  Yeah , yes .
C :  Case material we said rubber . I don't know what special colour means .
D :  Rubber .
A :  Yep .
A :  Mm anything uh I think which is not more .
D :  I think something coloured , yeah , probably . So I think this is probably special co no ?
C :  It could be
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? You know .
C :  Rub rubber comes coloured , it's I would maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , yeah yeah , okay .
C :  Yeah , let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , you might end up having to take off the
C :  We we're definitely going to have to so we've got pushbutton , and then we've
D :  We have pushbuttons ,
B :  sample sensor .
A :  Mm .
D :  scro we have scroll wheel as well .
C :  Scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? S for the muting .
D :  S yeah , yeah , we had , for muting , yeah . And we have L_C_ display and yeah .
A :  No uh we we have uh yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And button supplements .
D :  Um
A :  Mm no .
B :  .
B :  No .
A :  We don't have we're not using any of that .
C :  No .
C :  No ?
D :  Yeah , but what do we ha we have L_C_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel
C :  But the the spinning wheel's not there . I have think maybe it's integrated with the L_C_ display ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , let's yeah .
B :  We've got more than one pushbutton though , haven't we ?
C :  I think the pushbutton oh .
B :  'Cause then you have
C :  I don't know if that's one
B :  That means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? Not counting anything , we'd still be in budget .
C :  Yeah .
C :  That seems unlikely .
C :  Push what uh whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we I don't think that makes sense .
A :  Huh ? Wh wh what is the limit ? Uh .
B :  Twelve point five .
D :  We have to count all of them , or yeah .
A :  Mm I don't think so , no . No it says what what is the kind of interface , if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and L_C_D_ display , so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have .
B :  No . Well it doesn't , but it uh
C :  No .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And L_C_ display .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here .
A :  Wh wh what's our criteria ?
B :  This sample sensor .
C :  Our budget's twelve point five .
A :  Uh okay .
B :  Yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there .
C :  Yeah , so that has implications though for the .
A :  Uh it does not have for voice recognition , but it does have for the feedback speaker . when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello .
B :  Yeah .
C :  For the locator .
B :  But that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? We can afford to get rid of it .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm and the locator also goes away .
D :  But it was very no innovative innovativeness . Well um yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So that means no locator , does it ?
B :  I mean does
C :  What else does it need ?
D :  Well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps .
C :  Yeah , 'cause the sample speaker was , I think , more complicated then just a beeping thing .
D :  This would be
D :  Yeah , yeah yeah there you record your samples your speech samples and
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , okay , so we
A :  A also i in the case I'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . Uh I mean uh um yeah .
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Um
C :  Right , so we need one fifty off .
B :  See , I was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , 'cause
C :  Take it down to just a scroll wheel .
C :  We could do
A :  So tha that mean that we cannot press how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the L_C_D_ ? If in the L_C_D_ we can scroll , right ? But how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button .
D :  Yeah , then then we would be in the b budget .
D :  Yeah b no no , you can push this one , but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But that's well you would just have to to spin it down .
C :  You can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So that's point three .
A :  No w w w but ha it's it's the scroll wheel and I thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing .
D :  But I mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well .
D :  If you
B :  Yeah , I mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . That's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? Didn't that come with the L_C_
C :  That's with the L_C_
A :  That comes with the L_C_D_ ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  We decided , 'cause it's not on our list .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Oh so so the the this is
D :  Mm .
C :  The scroll wheel is on the side .
A :  . So we're adding costs for right , okay uh I mean I think this is good .
D :  So
B :  S so we're point three over .
C :  We're point three over at the moment .
C :  It's nothing n
B :  Unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether and just have pushbuttons for the volume .
B :  Could b still put them on the side .
B :  But yeah . I mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but
C :  Yeah , I have
A :  Instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . On the side . Mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , yeah .
C :  Rather than having three different things that people have to do .
A :  .
D :  Okay .
C :  There we go . Oh look , we're way under budget and we'll make huge profits and we'll all get bonuses .
B :  Yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ?
C :  Or or that we have to have some sort of special colour .
B :  Yeah , but
C :  So that's alright . We we'll leave it at that and then I'll take I can send it back to management and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , yeah . Excellent . Alright . So did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  We have , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  No . No , I don't think so .
A :  Not really , no . Because we keep all the features , we keep voice recognition , we keep L_C_D_ display . We instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . Um yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  We just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , and the scroll wheel is I mean essentially the two buttons that was it's not a great difference I don't think .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Alright then .
A :  But we lose the locator .
D :  Well we're going to have a beeping thing . But yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , so we still have the locate .
B :  Really ?
C :  We're gonna have a beep .
A :  So instead of speaker , .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Cool .
B :  That's not a very exciting colour . I think you should make it more vegetable-like .
C :  Tha
D :  Which colour , the the colour of the phone or the colour of the
B :  Oh the the beeper thing .
C :  .
B :  It
D :  But it can be yellow as well . It can come in the same colour as the the case .
C :  'Cause we we won't have run out of our pot of Play-Doh .
B :  Yeah , I think Jen wants it to vibrate .
C :  Yeah , I know I know , my pen vibrates . But only for a very short time . Um
B :  You know , your pen vibrates ? Yeah .
C :  okay .
C :  looks like we've designed a
C :  banana . Well done , team . Um we need we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product .
A :  I think it mm
B :  Cool .
C :  Feedback ? Ideas ?
D :  Yeah mm , as far as creativity is concerned , yeah I think there was there was room for creativity . The only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . Um we kap kept a adding things randomly . So , had we known
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  If we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can .
A :  Yeah , that or not , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah . So d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  But in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of .
A :  Yeah , mm .
B :  I think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . It wasn't like we were alone for very long , so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , and then , you know , come back three days later and Jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . Um yeah , so yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm . Banana .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used .
C :  Mm-hmm , the whiteboard digital pens . We like the pens .
D :  And the pens .
B :  Uh I like the pens . I want one . That would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s
C :  Yeah , you could take it to lectures and just write stuff down and have it printed out when you got back to the office . They great ?
A :  Yeah yeah yeah , that's it's it's I wonder what one of these costs .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Do you think they'd notice if one went ?
B :  I don't think you should say that was the recording . Okay , cover up the microphone . Alright , let's take it . Okay .
C :  Oh okay .
C :  Yep . Shh . Yep . But that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the PowerPoint , 'cause the I find that the problem with PowerPoint often is that it's so static and you can't change it once you're in there , yep .
B :  It is a bit limiting , isn't it ? Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  The thing flew in , you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . That's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah .
B :  Not that you can do that on the board , either . We could make some little
D :  But yeah , but I mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah .
B :  Yeah , totally , I mean that was fairly tight anyway , I mean especially with that last-minute alteration . back it , this is just had to be changed . And yeah , so cool .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Are we supposed to say nice things about Jen now ?
C :  And presumably you don't you can say nasty things as well .
D :  Yeah . I was I was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah .
C :  I have no stake in it .
B :  Yeah , definitely . You weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good .
A :  Yeah .
C :  You have to say that , 'cause I'm taking the notes . I'll leave the room and you can have another go .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I know you've got the pen , you might attack me with it .
C :  Better than that than the banana .
D :  And then the teamwork I think I think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah .
C :  I think it worked quite well . Did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  say their bit ?
D :  To express them mm mm no .
A :  Mm . I guess it was a fairly small group , so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  .
C :  New ideas found . Not quite sure what about . Yeah .
D :  Well it's it's it's pretty new , pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I don't know , I don't go shopping for remote controls that often , maybe somebody's already though of it .
D :  Yeah , neither neither do I , but I've never seen anything and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I'll be looking out next time I need to write an essay . That looks boring , I'll see if anyone's made a remote control .
C :  Yeah , that's right .
D :  Yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Patent patent patent . Mm .
C :  Banana remote .
B :  I think we'd like to think the ideas were new , but we've got no way of finding out .
C :  Yeah . Or you can always go to Google and type in banana remote control . Flip . Vibrate . And uh yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  That vibrates
B :  Yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it .
C :  Nothing that you really want . True . Yeah .
C :  Okay . So , costs are within budget , well within budget , including a little what have we got ? One Euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
C :  Um we've evaluated
D :  Yes .
C :  the project . You've got the scores . Can you put that in the project documents file ? It's in there already . And the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . Were there any was there anything that you found difficult , or anything
B :  And it's fabulous .
B :  It's in the project documents .
C :  that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ?
D :  And my main difficulty was the the time pressure . Otherwise it's it's all fine .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , sometimes it's like a little bit rushed .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I thought that was good though , because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah . Although we could have made the R_s better had we had five more minute .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay then . Um I think we're still well within our
B :  Yeah , we've got like five minutes left .
C :  time . We've got about five minutes left , but if we've finished , then we've finished . We're just too too efficient and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time .
D :  Yeah .
A :  We certainly are , mm . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
C :  So I would say that's the end of that meeting .
D :  Yeah , it was a pleasure working with you .
B :  'Kay .
C :  Thank you , team . It was very productive day and
A :  Yeah , same here .
B :  We could draw animals on the board again .
C :  Mm uh no .
A :  Mm uh no . I don't think so .
D :  You can make some animals . Oh , you don't like anim
B :  I don't like Play-Doh , no . It's just minging . It smells so bad .
D :  It doesn't ? Smells quite nice . Smells very sweet .
B :  It does .
B :  Mm .
C :  Right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . I don't know if it's already sent or not . Um presumably I have to
A :  Was there a questionnaire already sent ?
B :  No , it hasn't been .
B :  Do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ?
C :  I don't see why you can't stay here , really .
B :  Okay , so the other way .
C :  Did I save this one ? Production costs .
D :  I made your animal for you .
C :  It was supposed to be pink . But it was blue on the board .
D :  Yeah , that's the one
D :  It's Play-Doh .
A :  Play-Doh's edible . Did you know that ? It's definitely
D :  Because kids yeah .
C :  I've , I've definitely eaten it before . I didn't know was edible . .
B :  I used to eat it .
A :  Yeah .
D :  But um , it's it's made edible 'cause , yeah .
A :  It's it's chew proof .
D :  It's made edible 'cause kids eat it , and if it's wasn't edible then
A :  Yeah .
D :  Well , normal babies .
C :  Actually that makes sense , because I remember like , peopl I dunno if my Mom ever did it but I remember other people's Moms making like home-made Play-Doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah it is , yeah . Oh yeah .
A :  Right . Everybody everybody ready ? Okay , let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
C :  We've got some .
B :  We've got a cool prototype .
C :  Yeah , it's pretty exciting . So ,
C :  everything uh that we wanted we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , very simple and easy to use , yeah , double curved , um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , something that would be different uh , separate it from the other remotes out on the market . So uh I think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here .
B :  Double curved .
A :  Nice .
D :  That is cool .
C :  So , basically ,
C :  if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , the thumb button is the power button .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down .
D :  What's the big blue thing ?
C :  That's the lock button , has a L_ L_ on it and then the M_ is a mute button . And then it also has digit
D :  Oh cool .
A :  what button ? Um . Oh mute .
C :  For muting the uh
D :  And mute .
C :  Um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . So it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different .
A :  Okay .
A :  That certainly does .
C :  So all the , I mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them . So you don't you
A :  Mm .
B :  Which is ant anti-R_S_I_ .
C :  Yeah . It should be . And it's also conformable to the size of your hand . I mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  'S great .
C :  change that . So d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it
D :  Oh it's so cute .
A :  I have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one .
B :  Oh right , yeah .
C :  Ah , that's good thinking , yeah .
A :  But , that's I don't see why that's not possible .
C :  Yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes .
A :  Yeah . They make left-handed scissors , you know .
C :  Yeah , I didn't I didn't think about that , but I'd yeah , .
D :  Yeah , but then
D :  but then you can learn to use your right h like I was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ?
A :  Yes s
B :  Yeah , I know I know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse .
A :  Mm . Sure . Sure .
D :  Yeah , I'm sure they'll be able to
C :  Uh-huh .
D :  I mean it's only pressing buttons , you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . I think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so
C :  Yeah .
B :  Imagine d are you right handed ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Imagine you're doing it with your left hand , I don't think it's too
D :  Yeah , it's not
B :  But we can have both uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  Have them in stock .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Make 'em more appealing as well .
A :  But um other than that , I mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , I think I think it's great , yeah , great idea .
C :  Do you think it says R_R_ ?
B :  I think it does .
A :  I think it's , well , if the R_R_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , I'd say that could be quite fashionable .
C :  Fashion to electronics . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . And it's got the b the black and yellow and blue .
C :  Plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh .
A :  Yeah .
D :  .
A :  Yeah .
B :  There you go .
C :  So that's that's our end of things wha uh
A :  Yeah , very good , yeah . It's come up with what we've you know , the things that's what we've what we were looking at doing , hasn't it , all seems to be there . Well done .
C :  That's
C :  Yeah .
D :  And all the playing around is uh
A :  Um before we move on
D :  Yeah , I'm just do you wanna plug in ? Okay .
A :  I need that cable . Thank you . Yeah . Um .
A :  One thing I do need to do we need to look at , is the costs .
C :  The costs , was that what you said ?
B :  Play-Doh is very cheap .
A :  Well , yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  um
D :  Play-Doh won't last very long everybody'll go like , oops , it's gone .
C :  But it's edible .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
B :  Chew proof .
D :  Well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , .
C :  That was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Uh right . Okay , now I think we'll do this I could do you know , I can do this o on my own or I could do it with you , but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , so we're going for the kinetic power .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Oh ho-ho .
B :  Yep .
A :  And the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest
A :  thing that's inside it . Ooh . So the case , we've gone for the double curved .
A :  and it's made out of rubber .
A :  The interface is push-buttons .
A :  And button supplements well they're in diff special colours , aren't they ? So special colours .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  It's better for
A :  Special form , yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff .
D :  And special material .
C :  Yeah , I mean , these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so
A :  Yep . Yeah . Um .
A :  Are they made out of any special material ? No they're not . They're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple
B :  Rubber .
C :  The buttons are rubber .
D :  Well they're rubber , aren't they ?
A :  Okay . Right . So let's see if that comes within budget . And it does . That is gonna cost uh Yeah . That's gonna cost ten ten Euro seventy cents a unit to make . And our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . So ,
B :  Yeah .
B :  .
D :  We're under budget .
C :  That's cool .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  And we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected .
A :  this is all very very good . The bosses will be very pleased . Okay , let's just save this so I can e-mail it to you . Uh .
A :  Save it in save it in the uh my documents .
D :  It's already saved , I think .
A :  Splendid . Okay .
A :  So uh , that's done with this with this um doodah , so you're . Gonna do what you were gonna do ,
D :  Thank you .
D :  Mm .
A :  your evaluation .
D :  Oh , yeah . This is where we all get to I get to write on the , oops , on the board . Right . Oh .
D :  'S function
A :  F_ eight .
D :  Okay .
A :  I love the smell of that Play-Doh .
C :  Yeah , have some have some .
D :  Mm .
A :  I cou .
D :  Okay . So , evaluation . We're gonna do it all together so we evaluate each criteria . I've got the criterias . And we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , one being true , so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria , and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . And the criterias are , and I'll draw this up on the board so we have a box
D :  .
D :  And this is false , this is just like
D :  to keep you informed . So seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . So the first criteria . Do you all get what we're doing ? Okay , cool . Okay , first criteria , look and feel . So the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? As it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? So what mark should we give for that ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
A :  I would give it a seven .
C :  Yeah .
D :  As in it's not .
C :  Oh , sorry , one .
A :  Oh sorry , one , d yeah .
B :  A one .
D :  A one a one . So I'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . Second criteria , new technology . Have we implemented new technology ? As in the new high-tech
B :  Well , the kinetic thing , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  That was our main technological innovation w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new .
A :  .
D :  So it's .
D :  So we'll give it a
B :  Well so the um
C :  It's ergonomic , but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing . So on the technical side of it it
B :  Yeah . Yeah . True .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I'd say it's about a a twoish ? Two . Three .
C :  It's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , maybe , yeah , I dunno .
B :  Two .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Maybe three , yeah .
D :  three .
D :  So criteria three is is it easy to use ? I think it's a one , I think .
A :  Easy to use . I'd say it's I wouldn't not if you're left-handed it's not .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I would give it a I would give it a two , 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but
C :  Mm .
D :  Two , so it's
C :  Okay .
D :  But if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ?
B :  Mm .
C :  If we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then I would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Give it a t give it a two .
D :  Yeah , okay . 'Kay , criteria four is costs . 's great .
A :  Cost . It's come in under budget . So that's a definite one .
C :  Yeah . That was great .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Amount of buttons .
D :  Like the amount of buttons , 'cause people like a lot le like
A :  Contains only the necessary buttons . Yeah .
D :  So it's a one ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um criteria six . R_S_I_ is it good against ? Yes . Very good . It's one . And criteria seven , which is the last one , does it get lost ? Is it easy to get lost ?
B :  Yes s yeah .
A :  So it's anti-R_S_I_ .
B :  It's yellow .
C :  It is very bright , yeah .
A :  I don't think it's gonna get lost easily .
D :  No ? But it is smallish .
B :  Two .
C :  It's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know .
C :  Maybe it will . Uh .
D :  Mm . I think i it would , could be , could get lost .
C :  You think it could lost
A :  two .
D :  Mm . Yeah . I mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say I mean , it's not a one , definitely .
C :  Mm .
A :  I mean it
A :  No , I mean
C :  Okay .
A :  I mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but
C :  Yeah , anything , I mean . Okay . It's bigger than the average mobile , I guess .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But , yeah , it can get lost .
D :  The mobiles get lost all the time .
C :  Yeah . Okay , yeah , two is fine .
D :  But then you ring 'em and you find them . So
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Mm . Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . So , that's that .
D :  So that's the evaluation , so I'd say
D :  Yay .
B :  We've , we've done well .
A :  Alright it's all all systems go .
D :  It's like like a number one . Um .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Number one product .
C :  Mm .
D :  All done , thanks .
A :  We can't fail .
D :  We fitted all the criterias . Yeah .
A :  .
D :  Yeah , so
A :  Well done , Reissa .
D :  So that's that one .
A :  Okay , I I think um I just wanna put in as Project Manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , you know , both individually and as a team . You know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , psp , you know , especially you two . That's all , you know , gone very very well and and and be you know , has been good communication going on .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , during our design I mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and
A :  Did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ?
C :  just just
C :  We just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and
B :  Well .
B :  You know
A :  Fantastic .
B :  It is .
C :  Now you guys have been a a great team . Think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other R_R_ teams , .
D :  been cool .
A :  I think So I I , you know , and I think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design .
D :  In four diff in in four meetings . Funny , all designer meetings could be this quick .
A :  Yeah .
A :  You know , maybe this isn't a simulation , maybe this is actually so it's like Sony or someone like that they're they're just , yeah , they get
C :  Yeah I think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote .
D :  They're using our ideas .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , two years' time this will be on the market . Ex exactly that product um thum we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us . But um
C :  So at this stage , I mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? We don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  No , I think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . Or six , uh
B :  Oh really ?
D :  Just start summarising now .
D :  You can reply to the same message .
A :  I haven't got message .
D :  See summary , there . If you just reply to that one .
C :  So there's no way to like predict what our 'Cause we had a we originally had a
C :  As far as our financial uh um goals , we had a specific number for profits that we wanted . It was fifty mil fifty million
D :  Was it was it fifty or five ?
C :  I don't remember . But there's not a way to compute that , I mean , since we saved on the on the production cost , do we know how much we're making on profit ?
A :  It gets handed over to another department . What our what our project was was to come up with the product , basically . the for the and just basically is it it come can is it within budget . When it c when it comes to all the other things of how to sell it and , you know , the b the profits and all that that's other departments it's another team that actually work out the mai the oh yeah , the all the guys in the profit sharing , yeah . Um .
D :  Depends how much we sell .
C :  Uh .
C :  Hmm .
C :  But we have a vested interest prof profit sharing .
A :  Yeah , that's it . You know , we've we've we've made i we've made we've designed the product , we've ma we've got the prototype , it's within budget , it's does everything that we wanted it to do . It's new , it's it's um
D :  We finished an hour earlier .
A :  something that uh that isn't out there already .
C :  I think actually and one advantage of of this is that after the uh , you know , after this fad of fruit and vegetables passes this will still be c a cool remote , you know . We're not we're not you know , tying tying our cart to that one horse .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . Well , this is very marketable in that it is it's it's something that's kind of new and looks a bit quirky for people who want that , it's that it's um , hang on , I wrote it down here somewhere
D :  Mm .
D :  Definitely .
A :  Oh no I thi I put it in one of my e-mails that I sent off . Um that , you know , it's marketable in the sense that it's whilst all these other remotes uh actually do give you repetitive strain injury , our one does the complete opposite , you know , so that's something that's new , which is one of the criteria they asked us to come up with something with something new .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
C :  It make watching T_V_ healthy .
A :  Yeah , and if you're not having a good time with the T_V_ , you can f throw it about , you know . It's fine , it's kid proof .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Just don't sh don't throw it at any of the ornaments and break them .
C :  Uh .
A :  Well , you can break the ornaments , but you won't break that . Yeah . So all in all , I think we've done very well . Well done everybody .
D :  No .
B :  Mm yep .
D :  Yay .
C :  Right , you too .
A :  Um . Drinks are on the company .
B :  Cool .
A :  In the corporate bar that's next to the corporate swimming pool on the top floor that we're that've all just gained access to . Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  Glad to hear that .
A :  That's it . Well , as far as I t as far as I know . Um .
C :  That's it .
D :  Yep .
D :  We haven't got the five minute left thing yet .
A :  No . Anyone wanna play I spy ?
D :  Mm mm .
C :  I guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of
C :  silence .
C :  Should we call the day then ?
A :  Yeah , I guess . I mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire .
C :  Uh , right .
A :  Um .
A :  It's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  In project .
A :  But I'm not the authority to say that it is .
A :  Um how does everyone feel about the technology that's been used in this ? The sort of using of the the pens and writing on these special pads and all that ?
D :  I love it . I love it . I think it's cool . Being all wired up and a vibrating pen and it's cool .
D :  Being watched . Um
C :  Your moment to shine .
D :  Wow .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I thi you know , I'd I'd n yeah , as we said earlier , I've not never seen that before . something that t the whiteboard
B :  Yeah .
A :  thingy , that's great .
A :  Um , but a p a pen with a camera on it , I don't think it's such a new thing . I mean it's i or in such a new idea . It would be different if it was sort of hand writing recognition stuff , but as it's not it's literally that'll come up on a computer screen as a picture file rather than actual text .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  Right , I think they do want to do hand writing recognition on that , it's just the first step .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Mm .
D :  Logitech .
C :  I guess we should end this , since we're off off topic .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So . Shall we
D :  Meeting adjourned .
C :  Right .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay um ,
A :  welcome to our detailed design meeting . I'm pretty excited .
A :  Let's start it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that .
A :  Okay um the agenda we're gonna do an opening and then um I'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , then we'll have the prototype presentation and a look at the evaluation criteria . We'll look at the finances and finally a do a production evaluation and close .
A :  So , starting off with the um last the last one , oh I don't have it here um , but we talked about energy , we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , we want to use a simple chip , because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um , we're gonna need a scroll um , we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu .
A :  And it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels .
A :  Okay ? Let's do the look and feel design presentation first .
C :  Right , do you wanna start ?
B :  Right , well we made three different prototypes and I guess we'll start with with this one .
B :  Um we have our colours not are not fixed , but this is the general shape . Um it's you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand or you switch it over and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand . You can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , or you can push them with your
B :  index finger of your other hand , or even I mean there's a whole variety , you can hold it like this and press it with your same index finger .
B :  Uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big .
B :  We have our up and down buttons , which are also gonna be our channel selectors , and we have our little menu button here . If you push if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if uh the volume buttons rather . If you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . If we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your T_V_ channel choices shows up , and you have your five presets down here .
B :  Um if people wanna grab hold of that , see how it feels in your hand .
B :  That's our number one prototype . Um do you wanna present the potato , or shall I present the Martian ?
A :  like a little lightning in it .
C :  Okay , um
A :  The little lightning bolt in it , very cute .
C :  What
C :  We call that one the rhombus , uh the rhombus . Um this one is known as the potato , uh it's
D :  I could
A :  The v the rhombus rhombus ?
B :  That's the rhombus , yep .
C :  it's a how can I present it ? It's an ergonomic shape , so it it fits in your hand nicely . Um
C :  it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand .
C :  Um I've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . Um
C :  the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . So you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here .
C :  Um the red ones are for uh changing channels , channel up and channel down and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected .
C :  Uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select
C :  and that's basically it , that's the potato .
A :  Um on , off ?
C :  Uh that would be one of your channels , basically , so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off , yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah we turn it off .
D :  Could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ?
C :  Um not really , it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your T_V_ off .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  If you pressed and held it maybe .
C :  Yeah yeah , that that'd be one way of doing it , yeah . That'd work , yeah .
D :  If you like held it down , that would be on off .
B :  Yeah .
B :  On off , that's a possibility , yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  And then finally we have um the Martian or the pear , either way . Um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . Uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . We have the five preset seeds .
B :  And then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle .
B :  So , that's for your consideration as well , plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . We figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if I made the bot the bottom flat .
C :  Let's pass .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Sorry , what's the yellow one in the middle , I forgot .
B :  Uh the menu select button .
A :  Very interesting . I think that one's my favourite .
C :  So that's
C :  So that's our three prototypes . Um basically , in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons ,
C :  and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We were we were thinking that
B :  normally we'd go for fruity colours , but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down , maybe with with less contrasts on it . Yeah , something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but
A :  Mm 'kay .
C :  Would
C :  Yeah ,
C :  but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy .
B :  yeah .
A :  Now that was one thing that we brought up over email . I don't know if you picked up your email , but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right . Well we were we were talking about that a little bit when we got that email and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . It's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . So we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it .
A :  It's really
A :  Would it be very difficult to um just have an external device that like I dunno , you tape to your to your T_V_ um that when you press it you ha a little light beep goes off ?
A :  Do you think that would be conceptually possible ?
C :  I think it would be difficult technologically , because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , s so it's
B :  I think
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  I'm not quite sure how it would work and then I wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . Uh I mean ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ?
A :  That's true , mm 'kay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  There might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip
B :  to make it make a noise or something , but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , that's a fair evaluation . Getting lost . Um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now .
A :  Okay 'cause well , the designs are very bright , so you're right , they're gonna stick out , but um
B :  So d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? Um .
D :  I feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , even though this is like what you're init I'm initially drawn to , just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . I sort of like this one , like I I don't know why , it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , I dunno . But I also like the b the side buttons on that one , like I think that's kind of neat .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But I dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing that we also need to focus on .
A :  Could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? So then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ?
B :  Mm yeah , that's good , that's good .
C :  Yeah , it's possible , yeah , yeah .
D :  Ah , there we go .
B :  Here , stick it on .
C :  Put an extra the button on .
A :  Sure .
A :  Um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , if you've developed some ?
D :  Well do we w like I think we're supposed to have one that we do it for .
A :  Oh okay . Okay .
D :  That was I was a little vague on what exactly I'm supposed to do , but let me I have to like write something on the whiteboard , so .
B :  So where
A :  Okay .
A :  Do you need this or just write on the white board ?
D :  No , I actually don't have like a PowerPointy thing , 'cause I think it would be redundant .
A :  Okay .
B :  Right .
B :  Okay .
D :  I dunno .
A :  It's kind of like uh like a joystick kind of thing , you know , kinda push it .
B :  Ooh .
C :  Cool .
B :  Hey .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Maybe a little smaller than that .
B :  No , I kinda like it . That's hard to miss .
C :  It makes look more fruity as well .
A :  Oh it does , it's kind of like
C :  It's like a deformed foot , I dunno .
B : 
A :  There it could have a stem like that , 'cause I do l kind of like the stem .
B :  Like
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  It almost helps you ge keep a grip too , 'cause it goes in between fingers .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Interesting .
A :  I like this one .
B :  Okay , is that where people are leaning then , the potato ? I like the idea of the I mean that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one .
A :  Variety of colours are nice .
A :  I think I'm leaning towards the potato .
A :  Mm-hmm . I am worried about like um using a menu .
A :  Um in that like i withing menus there are submenus , and so how do you get back to the main menu ?
B :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well that on the iPod , for example , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again and it brings you back one level .
A :  But that has a menu button separate from a select button , whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Good point .
C :  This is , it's the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . You find the choice that you want and you press uh you press the right button uh .
A :  Okay .
A :  Could these be used for going to submenus or
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah .
B :  Maybe yeah , maybe it can be one of those , if you press down and hold
A :  Okay .
B :  for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . Well , as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still , mm 'kay .
D :  Okay , so which one are we sort of roughly looking at to address whether or not it meets our s um necessities , the yellowy one is that
B :  The potato ? Are we leaning towards the potato ?
C :  Potato .
A :  I think so .
D :  Okay , well we can obviously change it after we go through each different one . So basically what we need to do is some of the things that we've talked about before we need to make sure that that remote actually does conform to the things that we said it was going to . So what we sort of wanna do is that we each need to separately
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  rank each of the following things and then I'll tabulate an average just to make sure that it does meet that . So we'll just go through them one at a time and we'll just go around and each of you can tell me on a scale of one to seven with one being really extremely true
B :  Okay .
D :  and seven being not true at all , or false , if the remote that we've created conforms to the following criteria . So we can do this one first . First we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective .
D :  So like in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle so I'm gonna say it's like a three . That's just my opinion .
B :  Yeah .
D :  What does each of you
A :  I I kind of think it's it's unique enough that I'd give it a one or a two .
D :  Okay , well give it a number , sorry .
A :  Okay .
A :  I will give it a one .
B :  Um I dunno if it's it's creative . I dunno if fancy is the word I would use .
B :  I dunno if any of them are fancy in I'd say two , because c unique .
D :  Okay .
D :  And two , awesome . Alright , and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? I think it's extremely functional , I'm gonna give it a one .
C :  I'll go for two .
B :  Yeah , one .
D :  One ?
C :  I think it's it's functional , it's also pretty basic , so I'll give it a two .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um functional .
A :  I think it'll get everything done , I think it might be a little confusing at first , um , I don't know if that's gonna be a later one . Okay , then I'm gonna give it a two .
D :  Okay . Well there's some other ones , I will address that , yeah .
D :  Awesome , okay . Um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative .
A :  Did you give a functional ? Okay .
D :  Yeah , she said it was one . Um is it technologically innovative ?
D :  Mm .
D :  Not really , I mean not so much , 'cause we we don't have the L_C_D_ screen , we don't have fancy chip . Other than what it looks like , I dunno if it's really
A :  Well , the kinetic battery .
B :  In the battery , that's it .
D :  I kinetic battery is a big one , so .
B :  How many people would notice that , though ?
D :  Mm .
D :  But it but we know it's there .
A :  But they'll notice it after like a year , they'll be like hey , I have never changed the battery .
D :  And if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . I'll give it a three .
A :  Mm .
A :  Just the material .
D :  'Cause it we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really
B :  Yeah . I I would say that it's
B :  Yeah , like fancy versus creative it's it's
B :  different . But does that equal innovative ? I dunno . I'll give it a three .
D :  Alright .
D :  Everyone else ?
C :  I'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , I mean it's it's just it is just pushbuttons um , so I I'd give it a four .
A :  Think I'm gonna go with the four as well .
D :  Mm 'kay .
A :  I really like that kinetic battery though .
D :  Next , is it easy to use ? Just so you know , easy to learn will be separate , so don't overlap them . I think it's really easy to use . I'll give it a two .
A :  Mm 'kay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Um I'll give it a one . Pretty hard to mess up .
C :  I'll say one .
A :  Uh let's say two .
D :  Alright . Um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber I it's spongy all the way .
A :  Give it a one .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  I wonder if it bounces when you drop it .
B :  Ooh , that you couldn't it'd be harder to break , harder to lose .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm . 'Cause there would be less impact maybe , .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Iain , what do you give it ?
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah I'd I'd give it a one .
D :  Alright and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? Well , is it gonna be yellow ?
C :  Uh um .
B :  It it might be , 'cause that's our corporate colour , isn't it ?
A :  That's right , yeah , corporate colour , we didn't keep that in um well if we I know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity .
C :  Yeah .
B :  We might wanna keep it yellow .
D :  Yeah , but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah ,
A :  Um and can we have like an R_R_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? Okay .
B :  If we had a yellow
B :  Sure .
D :  Oh , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright , so I think it it's
A :  Fruity , so fruity .
B :  So it was inspired by the potato , so I think it's pretty fruity .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think i it's kind of mangoey too .
D :  Yeah . I okay , I'm giving it a one the mango put me over .
C :  Mangoey is better , yeah . I like mangoes .
B :  Oh , mango that that
A :  Yes .
A :  Mm .
B :  That's a much more trendy than a potato one .
D :  What are what's everyone's numbers ?
C :  Uh two .
A :  One .
D :  Alright um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? Remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most .
D :  I think we really took that into account a lot , so I'm gonna give it a one .
B :  Yeah , me too .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh one .
D :  Did you say one , Rose ?
A :  Yes .
D :  Okay um , also we talked earlier about R_S_I_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like Carpal Tunnely kind of thing . Do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ?
D :  I think I'll give it a two , 'cause I almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen .
A :  It's gonna be hard .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  And if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , but um
D :  Um um worth the risk , I think .
A :  I like how it fits in the hand though so I I'd go with a two .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I'll I'll say two as well . Because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , but
A :  Mm .
D :  'Kay .
C :  Yeah I'll I'll say two .
D :  Alright , awesome . And the ease of learning it . I know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that , I dunno . It sort of reminds me of the iPod . I just got mine , I still haven't read the instruction book and I'm doing okay , so and I'm not good at learning technology . So I'll give it a two .
A :  Mm .
B :  The menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , but I think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . So I'd I think I'd give it a two I guess .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , because you have to you have to use the menu system and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are and that could take a bit of learning at first , but
B :  Oh , good point .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  once you've , yeah once you'd learned how to use it , I think it is a lot easier . So I'd I'd give it a four .
D :  Okay .
A :  I think I'd give it a four too . It's a pretty high learning curve , it'll be easy once you've done it , but
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright , um also earlier we had something about losing it and so now we're not addressing that at all , so
A :  We we I think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , but
D :  Okay , so in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? I'm gonna I'm gonna give it a four , 'cause I think that you can still if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it , you're kind of not gonna find it , but anywhere else it's gonna stand out .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Um I'd say I'd give it uh a three , I guess it depends on how tidy you are normally .
A :  Mm I'd give it a four .
C :  Um I'll give it a five 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah .
A :  Small too .
D :  Alright , we also said simplicity , how w how well does it address just being simple ?
B :  Simple to use or simple in design ? Do you know ?
D :  I think overall , 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , so those are the next two things we're gonna look at . Separate from fancy , like that sort of thing .
B :  Right .
D :  Um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple , so I'm gonna give it a two .
B :  I'm give it a three I guess .
C :  I'll give it a two .
A :  Three .
D :  Alright , and fashionable ?
A :  It's totally fashionable . I'd give it a one .
D :  It's hot , I mean it's a mango , come on .
A :  Mango .
D :  I mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? I think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well .
B :  I dunno . I don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote
A :  I do like uh the little Martian one .
B :  or alien or whatever he was .
D :  Yeah , the toggle on off switch , it's really appealing .
D :  Number .
B :  Um two .
C :  Three .
A :  One .
D :  And does it meet our like demographic need sort of for international appeal ,
D :  that whole thing ?
D :  Just that it would se serve our audience .
D :  I don't see why not .
A :  Mm-hmm . I think as long if we offer in a in at least three different colour arrangements .
A :  Um yeah , that's good .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So I'll give it a a two .
B :  Yeah , I'll say two .
D :  Alright , did anyone have any other features that they think were important that we didn't talk about ?
A :  Well um we didn't we didn't address the fact that it does need to b have a corporate logo , so let's let's make sure we keep that in mind that we ha that one of our colours concepts is corporate and has an R_R_ on it . All of them should have R_R_ , yeah .
B :  Shall we uh
B :  Well I think all of them should have an R_R_ .
D :  And so we're gonna do that , so it will address it , fine .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm 'kay .
D :  Okay .
D :  That's me .
A :  Lovely .
A :  Okay , now we're gonna look at finances . Um I have an Excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um ,
A :  so let me exit out of this first .
A :  Okay um
B :  Oh my .
D :  Whoa .
A :  I know .
A :  Let me one more space . Gonna zoom in real quick .
A :  Okay . Hand dynamo .
A :  We're using kinetic battery , right ?
B :  Uh we're n using kinetic , yeah .
A :  Um and we're having one per
B :  Yeah .
A :  One , okay . Um electronics .
B :  Single . Simple , simple rather .
A :  Simple .
D :  Simple .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Um the case .
B :  Uh uh uh double-curved .
C :  Guess it's double-curved . It is pretty curvy .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It's very curvy , so okay .
B :  Yeah I never did get a picture of those so I don't really know .
B :  Our case material supplements oops , we just skipped by them . No , we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . The supplement is
D :  Well don't we need plastic , and
D :  Provided , okay .
A :  The wood ?
B :  Oh , I guess it was rubber rather than latex .
A :  I mean the rubber .
D :  It was rubber and special colour , right ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm , okay .
D :  Do we have more than one special colour ?
B :  Uh well
A :  Yeah , we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours .
C :  Special colours , isn't it ?
A :  Um .
B :  I don't know what the se the basic colour is though .
D :  Per
A :  I dunno where it yeah .
D :  Well , but we know that we're having at least three colours , so
A :  So let's y say three .
B :  Well , are we talking about on each colour combination or are we , you know , we'll like we'll have yellow and black . Is that two special colours ?
A :  Yeah , I dunno . That I thi I thought that would be under yours .
B :  Or or is white and black , then two more or
B :  Uh .
B :  I guess it's three , three three .
A :  We'll just say three .
A :  Mm-hmm . Maybe the R_R_ will be in colour as well , so yeah . Interface , we're doing push buttons . And how many buttons do we have ?
D :  Right .
B :  Alright .
B :  Yeah .
D :  We have six .
C :  We've got five . Oh six .
B :  Six , with the power .
A :  Six .
D :  Oh no , five .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Anything else ?
B :  No . Oh , we'll do we wa
B :  Are the buttons in special colour , special f
B :  I didn't get information on
D :  Oh wait .
A :  Oh , buttons oh , so um . So the case material will just have one colour , right , but then the buttons will be in special colours ?
B :  Well , does it but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where I'm getting confused .
D :  Yeah .
A :  We're saying per unit .
B :  per unit , okay , okay .
D :  Yeah , per unit .
A :  Okay , so each unit will only have one colour on their but the case is
B :  Alright , and each button s
A :  could have up to thr I mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , 'cause that how it's designed there . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
D :  I like it like that .
A :  Special form ? They're all kind of just push button , right ?
B :  No , I think they're fine . Material , we want them rubber as well probably , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Special material ?
A :  Uh . Oh do I have to do it per button , do I ?
B :  No , I don't think so .
B :  I think they're if they're all gonna be rubber then it that's what it matters .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , 'cause it wouldn't make sense otherwise , 'cause for the whole mat case material it's only one . It's I mean it's two to make it rubber . Oh wait , so maybe .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Thirteen point seven .
B :  Oh oh .
A :  Yeah , what can we reduce ?
B :  Okay , let's have our buttons all be one colour .
D :  Mm , I kind of like the buttons .
A :  Let's see what that would do . It's only gonna bring us down to thirteen point three anyway .
B :  Alright .
A :  Okay um , are we sure this is double-curved ? Maybe it's single-curved , we have no idea .
B :  Uh .
B :  We have no idea .
B :  I dunno , I didn't get any pictures .
B :  It's single curved . Why not ?
D :  It's single curved .
A :  Well it's not the yeah . Okay , it's the kinetic battery that's kind of expensive , but we have a simple chip , single curve ,
A :  case material is rubber and it's a special colour , but that's important . Six buttons we have to have six buttons .
B :  Yeah .
B :  That is important . How did it get more expensive , what did you just change ? It was it was thirteen and now it's fifteen .
A :  What ?
A :  No , okay , maybe not . I don't know what just happened . Now it's twelve .
C :  What was our target price again ?
B :  Twelve point five . Hey hey .
A :  Twelve point five .
C :  Twelve point five . So we're just just about there .
A :  So we're okay , I think .
B :  We're all set then .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Ish .
A :  Okay , we're all set . Um save . I saved that to our um our big shared folder , so you know . Um okay , back to agenda .
B :  Alright .
A :  Um are the are the costs under twelve fifty Euro ? Yes . Let's move on to the project evaluation .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , they are .
A :  Project process .
A :  Satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . So I guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , the information we got on the news , how we used it , if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , um how how well I guess I led it , um the how well we worked together as a team , um the digital pens , the whiteboard .
B :  Well .
A :  Okay .
B :  I felt very creative . I enjoyed making the prototypes .
C :  I think we've been successful in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set and we've come up with a finished project and we just about got cost .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , like what's a single-curved case , how many colours , what do colours count
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  things , but given given what we had I think that we did we did really well .
B :  Um I think we worked together pretty well .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I mean if I'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could've taken that into account .
B :  Yeah . But the fruits and vegetables , they really my creativity , so .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I know , I really did , the the whole mango idea was great . No , I mean
B :  Do you think we could
D :  I thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , I dunno . That was a bit of a distraction . That was the last one , like I chose not to do a PowerPoint 'cause I didn't think it made sense to , so I liked that I had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I think we all made um very significant contributions , I don't think anybody dominated it , which I thought was really good , like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information and I uh I tried to facilitate it without like taking over , um
B :  Yeah .
A :  I like our little finished products .
B :  Can we market this as the mango remote ? Should we have that somewhere on the packaging ?
D :  They're funny .
A :  Really cute .
D :  I kind of want one .
B :  I have a little R_R_ .
D :  I'm trying to think of a good pun that I could add there .
A :  I know , let's think of it like a little jingle .
A :  Um .
D :  I like the R_R_ , that's gonna be etched in .
B :  Yes . Hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point but um it's quite a useful little gadget .
B :  All thanks to Iain for the design of that one .
A :  .
A :  Okay um new ideas found ?
B :  Mm . What did we find for new ideas ? People should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables .
A :  Definitely . Or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm
C :  Yeah .
B :  I I am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . That was
A :  etcetera .
A :  Oh , I'm so excited .
D :  Yeah , I didn't even know they existed .
B :  I I knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches that just never need a battery , 'cause you're always moving your wrist .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But in other things , I think it'd be really good .
A :  I thi yeah , that's awesome .
A :  Um okay , closing .
A :  Are the costs within the budget ? Is the project evaluated ? Now there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . Um so , this is the great product kids , I think we've created something really interesting and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three which we hope um
B :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
A :  yeah . Make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of
A :  both the process and the um the final results and . I do like the Martian remote . If we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice .
D :  Yeah , Real Reaction .
D :  Oh , that would definitely be my second choice .
C :  Mm .
A :  Although the tog toggle
A :  I'm afraid I would
C :  That's cool . Let's all let's all go for the yellow
D :  I would break it . I would break it .
A :  It's cool . I think I would break it .
B :  It started because I wanted to have it as st as a stem and then alright , so
C :  Break the stem off .
D :  Oh that's funny .
B :  Is it started as a pear , but then it started looking more and more like a Martian when I put the
D :  Kind of looks like a penguin , like with no eye .
A :  Oh yeah , it's kind of a penguin .
B :  Take me to your leader .
D :  I like that it stands up .
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  Wow , maybe I should market it to some remote control company now .
B :  So are are poor little thing .
C :  That was bound to happen
D :  Oh , sad .
A :  Mm 'kay , congratulations .
A :  Um .
A :  Anything else to say ?
D :  Nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , its all timed .
A :  Alright .
B :  Oh .
A :  Um anybody have I got more master classes , anybody else wanna like take a master's class ?
D :  Oh .
B :  It's really funny that you got spam in your work emails .
A :  Yeah , but check it out . So like there are all these like links , they don't go anywhere .
A :  But all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management . Um just wanna make sure you do .
D :  No the first one that you sent like I didn't realise that it was a joke and I was like why did she send this to us ? It's very it's very work relevant , 'cause people send spam a lot .
A :  Oh
A :  It is .
A :  Yes definitely I'm very sad that I didn't get any links to the corporate website .
B :  Let's see , what did I get through the corporate website ? It's just inspiration about circuit boards .
D :  Oh here you can you can view .
A :  .
D :  You can just see what's up .
A :  Wow .
D :  Yeah it's it's really deep . Hold on .
D :  Takes a little while to get excited to load . That the Excel thing is pretty cool . Here , like , basically it's like inspiration , basically I'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and
A :  Yes . I love Excel , it's one of my favourite programs .
B :  Yeah , that is pretty neat .
D :  that kind of thing , see . You didn't miss out that much .
A :  I see , mm .
B :  Yeah , my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards . I learned a lot actually . I could probably take apart a remote control now if I really needed to .
A :  Spongy .
C :  Mm .
D :  Oh wow .
D :  This one was cooler . I got a whole table and everything .
B :  Now I have all about circuits and chips and transponders and I wrote it all down , because I thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , but then they're like , you don't actually need this you just need to talk about the case .
D :  That's like mine it was like , would you prefer an L_C_D_ screen or a multifunction remote control ? And then it didn't have like any kind of table , like awesome , I'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result .
B :  It's really interesting though .
A :  I I thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  We had a lot of the um otherwise the technology today was kinda cool .
C :  I think .
B :  That was really neat how I got emails and
C :  Yeah .
C :  We didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  No .
A :  No . Although I don't see how we could have very l at least for me I
B :  I yeah . If I'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , I would have probably drawn them up , but
A :  Mm .
D :  'Cause we weren't like voting on anything and I think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period .
B :  Yeah , we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , but with only four people it doesn't really make sense . I think if you had a larger group
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But I thought we were good orally .
D :  Get crazy .
A :  And with and with the PowerPoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on PowerPoint as that's not as necessary to have .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to
D :  like write up them here , 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Because we're all gonna be working in different places . We if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright , but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , I guess .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Now when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ?
C :  Uh we we worked together , um but we were making like we sort of made different shapes and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , um and how we could like improve on the on the design .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  So it was a bit of both really , we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and
B :  just fooling around with it and I came up with that rhombus shape and he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , and then just went from there really .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Cool .
B :  It was fun .
B :  So well done with the management , I felt well managed .
A :  Oh thanks .
C :  I think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time , and second we actually
A :  It's kinda fun .
C :  we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings .
A :  Mm .
D :  Sorry .
C :  And I
B :  That happened to me all the time though .
C :  I know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . But I think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings , so that we we knew where to go on from there .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , I was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions , but we were able to do it regardless , so .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I'm not usually a very decisive person , so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes .
A :  This is what we'll do .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes
A :  sometimes in the meetings .
C :  Yeah , for some of the meetings , yeah .
B :  Especially last time , yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah I think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , you know what I mean , like we we couldn't answer every single question .
B :  Yeah ,
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
A :  Um but
B :  And I I felt the first two meetings , that I was coming in with no information , and not sort of
A :  Mm .
B :  made me really like , ooh I don't know , throwing together PowerPoint out of no no information and then last time it was like the opposite . I had so much information and so much to talk about .
A :  It was interesting what came out like later , like as I was doing the when I was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um , that more points came out from your presentation even .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Um .
A :  I'm a little I am a little disappointed that we didn't do a um something for losing the remote , because that was kind of a big point .
B :  Yeah .
B :  that was something like in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like
A :  About yeah .
D :  Well the problem was , even when we just were creating from the Excel file , there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included , so there was no we could be like yeah , it has it included . There was no way for us to have
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think we were
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Considered the re yeah .
D :  written down that it was really there .
B :  I think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task . I think we really got into it , I mean I got into it as the day went on and I got really like , ooh I'm designing a remote control , I dunno if that's just me , but
A :  Well it's interesting that they
A :  Mm-hmm , yeah . It was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote and yet they didn't provide us with information to um we weren't provided with information to discuss that .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep , but I but I'm sure that would require some kind of technology that
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I just don't know what it is , but
B :  I think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things
B :  so you won't lose them .
A :  Mm .
B :  I dunno . I mean we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever 'cause there's only one T_V_ and
A :  Hmm .
B :  there's only like three chairs .
D :  That's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys , and I always do , anyway .
D :  You'll lose 'em in your pocket , like you just will forget that or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , there's always ways to lose things .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  It d yeah , it depends on how organised you are personally , but
B :  Yeah , or like I guess what the setup of the house is too .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But , I mean
B :  I am notorious for losing my keys , I just I guess I've just never lost the remote . I put my keys in the refrigerator the other night and couldn't find them . 'Cause I was putting groceries away .
D :  That's funny .
A :  Oh .
B :  You you're taking stuff from a bag and putting them in the refrigerator and then go back to my room .
A :  Can't get in .
B :  Can't get in , look all around the kitchen .
B :  Definitely in the vegetable drawer .
D :  That's funny .
B :  So .
D :  I always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using a different coat .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yep .
B :  But I guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Can't really take it into the other room .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , I am located
B :  Oh a G_P_S_ system , internal G_P_S_ .
D :  Oh man .
D :  Here you go .
A :  We should make one that walks by itself .
B :  Although if it's sitting still for too long .
B :  Yes I
D :  That really could get up and walk away .
B : 
A :  Or or like some crazy like electro-magnet , that you push it and it'll go zoom to the T_V_ and stick there .
B :  Or little
B :  Or just just a wheel , you know .
B :  Just if you like you'd have a remote for your remote , that'll .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Well , but if you could attach them to the T_V_ , then you can .
B :  zoom
B :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
B :  All kinds of possibilities .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Sorry , I'm just um trying to update my minutes . I decided to you know how I sent you the email saying that PowerPoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them . Just gonna make I'm making full minutes , so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that . 'Cause that seems a little more useful .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Oh .
B :  Wow .
B :  'Cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do .
A :  But I didn't have like information to sloth through either , so
B :  Yeah , I guess
B :  How much of your PowerPoint was already done for you , every meeting .
A :  Most of it , mm-hmm . I added slides , um I added a couple slides each time , but that was about it .
B :  Oh .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , I didn't even think about adding slides , 'cause I would just get slides with titles on them and fill them all in w didn't even think about adding more .
A :  Mm .
A :  Well , the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points , but it wouldn't have a slide for each point . And that's the only way I remember that I need to go other that point . I know personally when I do PowerPoint , that's what I do and so I had it once , even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and I would do your three .
B :  Ah yeah. .
B :  Right .
D :  You have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like
A :  The slogan on it ? No no no .
B :  No , no , definitely not .
D :  Okay good .
B :  We
D :  'Cause I was like , it could go around the outside .
B :  No , I don't think we need to I think the R_ and R_ , especially if the yellow and black one .
A :  I think we just need the um the R_R_ , yeah .
D :  Is it yellow and blue ?
B :  Or yellow and blue . Lemme go to the web page .
A :  Yeah , I was just kinda going by the web page , 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or .
D :  Oh I guess it is black , grey . Grey is better than black , doesn't look so bumblebeeish .
A :  I don't really like yellow in general .
D :  Hey now I understand the random like newsclippings .
A :  But it
B :  Finish meeting now .
A :  Wasn't it interesting that um I thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um
D :  Yes .
A :  the marketing choices , you know , like that was a bit of a conflict .
D :  I will I just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , it's kind of an they were so not backed up , it would just be a sentence like we did a survey , this is what people said .
D :  S mm , I dunno .
B :  Yeah .
A :  People are stupid .
B :  I guess it i it sort of a grey , isn't it ? Yellow and grey , but then the slogan's in blue .
D :  Well we got some grey and we got some blue buttons , we're good .
B :  Yeah . Well we don't have the right colour clay anyway .
A :  Maybe , like I don't know . That could always be .
B :  Well we're not , sadly , going to actually be producing this , so .
A :  Oh .
D :  If they ever come out with potato
B :  Potato mango shaped remotes .
D :  I'm gonna have to
A :  I'm claiming it intellectual property .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I can't believe a whole day is gone . I don't feel like it's been that long .
D :  I know .
B :  Get sucked in .
B :  Mm I haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet .
D :  Okay .
D :  Oh I totally
D :  Yeah 'cause I moved it .
D :  'S put it over here . Then we don't have to worry about it .
C :  Ready for this ?
A :  All set ? Cool .
A :  Alright , it is PowerPoint time .
A :  I've done more PowerPoints in this particular experiment than I've ever done in my life before this experiment which is kind of fun .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh man .
A :  So uh here we have our detailed design meeting where we will um look at the prototype and um right so um , I finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my that my coach was sending to me . It means I'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting .
B :  Oh really ? Okay .
A :  I think . I don't know . Otherwise it's just saying I'm the secretary and I'm therefore I'm taking the minutes , s so just to go um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , uh , I will open them slowly , no ? Wait for it , wait for it .
D :  Huh .
D :  Yeah that's not you .
A :  No . That's how the
A :  Wait .
A :  This is , this is very high-powered stuff here , double-clicking , there we go . So um basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the Industrial Designer , uh or from Nathan , and Ron and from Sarah about what we can do here um and what
A :  sort of limitations we're operating with um uh excuse me what limitations we're operating under , what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , I_E_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote since you could just use your voice . That would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . Um , and uh the uh uh the U_I_D_ and the I_D_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . So .
A :  That's sorted , back to the main
A :  meet here , um , go ahead and take it away guys .
B :  Well . Uh , we have assembled our prototype , um . What's to be said about it ? Um , we took into account a lot of the things that we went over in the last meeting , um . Some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen which you can see and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  This is going to be the on off button and we have these buttons to go through the channels um and then two volume buttons down here , d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . And then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . But this actually can slide back in and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um .
B :  As far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , why not ?
D :  Ah .
A :  Nice .
D :  Fair enough .
B :  Of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . Um .
A :  Perfect .
C :  No it's important to we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here um f we call it fruity if you will . Um . Right , um , of course that's uh interchangeable and uh I think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued but this is kind of something that can be done um and as you can see on the television there uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . Um . So that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption .
B :  Go ahead .
D :  Mm .
D :  Right .
D :  Appropriate , okay .
D :  Mm 'kay .
D :  It is an option .
A :  Oh , right .
B :  That's this here .
D :  Ah . I see .
C :  Um , what other things do we see here , well , um if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , um , so I think that will work well with regards to our market . Um and uh let's see , well clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . Um uh do you have anything else to add to that ?
B :  Um I worried about the materials , it is uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating so it's very durable uh , it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped .
B :  Um , and of course as you can see and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel .
C :  It's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside .
B :  Fact , I dunno if you noticed , but I wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen , I thought that was kinda nice . This was actually an apple on the inside . This
A :  Oh well done yeah , yeah oh ok
D :  Nice .
D :  Do we need to worry about um rot factors ?
C :  Um it's encased in a new uh type of uh
D :  Oh okay , there's preservatives involved , we don't need to worry , okay .
B :  Yeah . We got a bit ahead of ourselves , I know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but
C :  polymer yeah . It's fine .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Fair enough .
A :  Edible televisions , it's a wave of the future .
D :  No but
C :  It's pos a possible new product . Um , but I think that's I think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , um I dunno if you guys have any questions or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . Um , did we come in under budget ?
D :  It's a couple years off at least .
D :  Okay .
A :  Brilliant .
B :  Right .
B :  Uh we did , yeah . This cost well to put this into um production , we're looking at about what was our goal ? It was twelve fifty Euro um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine .
B :  Um , so I was quite pleased with that . One thing that we didn't do um obviously we had a choice with the buttons whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , but we just went for a classic rubber button and um since we did that we didn't have to use as many microchips which was quite nice and that's what helped keep the cost down . So even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote and um I think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Brilliant .
D :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
C :  Did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ?
B :  And
B :  Oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ?
C :  So uh so uh yeah on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console and uh I think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . Um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . Basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier and um , I think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not . And uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm 'kay .
B :  Hmm . Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  Cool .
B :  Any questions ?
A :  No , no I think that's
D :  Do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? Covers ? In play now or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ?
B :  Um , do you wanna answer this one or do you want me to answer it ?
D :  Do we know where we stand on that yet ?
C :  Well we didn't quite have enough material uh .
D :  Oh I wasn't expecting a prototype I just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Oh I see , right , um .
B :  Um , well as you can see this is just a most superficial layer and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like
D :  Okay .
D :  Just veneer really , yeah . Okay .
C :  Right . Actually this bottom red ring here just unclips and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . So I mean there are I we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials which I think worked out fine . We also continued on with the ideas that f following uh Apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And the whole thing
D :  Okay .
D :  Right .
D :  Yeah . There's
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Okay , very cool .
B :  It's not it's not quite a a face plate , it's more like a pseudo-face plate because it's simple enough that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments and we could go the face plate way if you know what I mean .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yep . It's still an option if we need it . Very cool , nice job .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right , yeah thanks guys that's very , very good work . I like it , brilliant .
A :  Um , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um I got me you've got you provided a number that actually sounds quite nice . Um the trouble is I was just given this by finance . Um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts and I've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um . I'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , but it looks like
B :  Oh .
B :  Ooh .
A :  So we'll just if we can just itemize what's in here , we've got this it's a solar cell thing right ?
B :  Right uh we didn't really touch on that but it it's in there , yep .
A :  With a back-up battery ?
A :  With the ba okay . Um and
C :  The voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . Yeah .
A :  Clever , clever , well done . Um so I guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um
A :  It's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time isn't it ?
B :  Yeah , yeah . It's just making use of the same space and the same materials , but
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , I guess would be that be the general
B :  Yeah , one big curve I guess you could say .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . Um . Push button interface
A :  um with this other drop-down so maybe we've got two push button interfaces don't we ?
B :  Yeah , mm-hmm .
A :  Um .
A :  And um a special
A :  I guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout , yeah .
B :  Yeah , special . And s I guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , don't you ? 'Cause it i it is very unconventional , I like to think of it as unconventional .
A :  Yeah , it's it's quite unique . I like it , yeah it's
A :  So it looks like
D :  M come in at sixteen ?
A :  a bit over budget , um .
B :  Oh . Huh , doesn't match up does it ?
A :  So what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells
A :  um or take out the back-up battery . Uh
B :  How do you feel about that ?
C :  I mean I think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , although it does still have a battery so I'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time when people are calling and saying oh look my remote isn't working what am I gonna do ? People'd be real upset . I think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm k .
D :  True .
A :  Hmm .
A :  What's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , it would have to be seems like we'd have to go back to
D :  Nah .
A :  square one
A :  in a way . Um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental I mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget if I've done my math correctly .
B :  Hmm .
C :  I mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing I mean that's what sets us apart right ?
D :  I mean
D :  Which , it's yeah that's what setting us into this young market , I mean that's where we started from , so
D :  I don't know , and I mean you know perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league .
B :  Right .
C :  And the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , I'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , but I h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here and uh you know I think I think that I think that we need to come to a compromise here and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell .
D :  Right .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
A :  It's either or .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . I guess we might have to do that . It's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal isn't it ? Of twelve fifty .
D :  I think unfortunately that's our best option .
D :  Mm .
A :  'Cause we can't remove the push buttons 'cause they're um and we can't get rid of the uh I mean removing the changing the case wouldn't be so much of a
D :  It kind of yeah .
B :  Yeah , .
C :  Savings .
A :  mm-mm , um , nor would changing the case materials .
D :  Mm-mm .
A :  Um . So yeah that looks like to be the only thing . So that would be the it's a major change but
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Alright , so we're in agreement on that .
B :  Gotta do what you gotta do .
D :  Unfortunately I think we are .
C :  No , I think that was a good compromise you brought forward Sarah .
A :  Right .
A :  Moving along swiftly . Um , so I guess now we just go to the project evaluation
A :  which I will allow Sarah to take over .
D :  That would be me . Um cord ?
A :  Ah of course , sorry .
D :  No problem .
A :  Whoosh .
D :  Can you reach , that would be great , thank you .
C :  Yep .
A :  That'd be great
D :  I didn't even do that one on purpose either , damn . Okay , um , basically I was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of these are the things we needed to do , these are the things that look like we feel they're important . Um so I was looking at basic design things , does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? Is the design what we wanted it to do ? I are technologies up to where we hoped they would be and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? Um .
D :  Basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? Does it respond to voice recognition ? And overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . Um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting because it's a new sort of interface , um that looked like it was coming up rough , but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . So I think overall we're headed in the right direction .
B :  Mm .
B :  Really good .
D :  So .
C :  They like that spongy feel .
D :  Yeah . It looks like it's going over well , so
C :  And the paging function works well , that's good to hear , we worked hard on that one .
B :  Six ?
D :  we're we're good yeah . Yeah . It's I think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , so it's all good .
B :  We did .
A :  Brilliant .
B :  I am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel but it's okay .
D :  That's everything from me .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , it is a set-back , but
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay , do you need the cord back ?
C :  W we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again that we're
A :  Um yeah , I was just go on .
B :  I know .
A :  Well they don't own tellys anyway do they ?
C :  I guess that's true .
B :  True .
A :  Right . So , um , this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . I got this slide from the coach and I'm not sure what it's connected to . Um so I guess we are going to discuss um our project process um and that is gonna go into my report . So I guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth and how that all worked , I guess , um .
B :  Okay .
D :  As in within the team or ?
A :  I think so yeah .
B :  Right so it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or
D :  Okay .
A :  I think it's
A :  I mm-hmm , I think so .
B :  'Kay .
A :  I think hope I'm not screwing up an experiment .
D :  It is now , you're in charge so there you go .
A :  But I trust that she would jump in if I was so okay fair enough . Um right , um so any thoughts ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Whatever .
B :  Are we considering these points here ? Okay .
D :  Um .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I think they're starting blocks yeah .
A :  What do you guys feel about the process ?
D :  Um , you know I think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , considering the little amount of input we had going in . Um , and the technology has definitely been a help , it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  We didn't use the whiteboard at all .
D :  No , we didn't . We could now if that'd make up for it but really and I feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter .
B :  No .
A :  No , no whiteboard .
C :  And
C :  Um , also had I not been intrigued about the pen , I don't think I woulda used it at all , I didn't write barely anything .
D :  Yeah I think I was taking notes more often than usual just 'cause I liked the pen , yeah .
B :  Yeah , it's true .
B :  Mm .
C :  Uh .
A :  Was pretty cool tack though .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Definitely .
D :  Mm . I am disappointed I didn't get a note back from my personal coach .
B :  As you write your personal coach .
D :  Yeah , but I didn't get a response so we'll see .
B :  What if you get a response two or three months from now ? That'd be weird .
D :  Okay that would be kinda creepy .
A :  Attempts to contact coach ineffective .
D :  Well what kind of coaching is that really ? What if I really needed something .
C :  I so I don't n I think there was a lot of room for creativity , we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um .
D :  I think so .
D :  And even then we did get a decent product turned out although it's not everything we wanted it to be .
C :  With the natural look .
B :  Yeah .
B :  That's very natural .
A :  Very natural look .
D :  Organic , really . And highly resourceful team mates might I add which is always a plus .
A :  That's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think , yeah re I thought it was like really creative actually , I mean .
C :  I think the teamwork was good as well .
D :  Mm yeah , I'm impressed .
B :  And to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of Play-Doh , we used every bit .
D :  Nice . All four of those little containers .
A :  Including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern .
B :  Yeah , I guess
B :  My one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , we only had four , wasn't enough .
D :  Yeah . You could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours .
B :  I know it could have been amazing .
D :  Oh well .
A :  What did you guys think about the the the roles ?
B :  Hmm .
D :  They were good .
B :  Yeah it's f kind of fun , it was
D :  Yeah .
B :  I think it was pretty clever 'cause we were never able to get too far off track because the information came in at the right time and kind of filled in the gaps enough . At the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , which was kind of fun .
D :  True .
D :  Do your own . Though I did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I mean maybe it's just me but I didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . Nothing , I didn't even get an email , like that was it .
A :  That's true , I I got this spreadsheet .
D :  So , yeah , I feel like that was slightly lacking but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . Whatever .
C :  Well I think that was I think that was an issue I kept finding with regard to well no but also yeah when I was reporting about what each of us was doing I was often confused as to what you were doing um and then I also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was because that was kind of the interface portion which was what the whole project was about uh but and then in the end I think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , which was fine .
A :  Of what to do .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh-huh , that wasn't very much .
B :  You know
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
A :  Mm , mm .
D :  Hmm , very much so .
B :  Yeah . That was fun . I think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the PowerPoint slides already put together for you 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot .
D :  Very much so .
A :  Cool .
C :  And I think your leadership was quite good .
D :  Hmm .
B :  It was really good yeah .
A :  She said I I I she actually made a comment off boy you're getting into this and I really I think it's true I did get I I felt like I got way too into it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  That's kind of a good thing though , you know , give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey .
A :  I felt like I slipped into it a lot .
B :  It's kinda fun .
A :  I dunno .
C :  An so is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ?
A :  The first time I've ever done anything like yeah project project management . I usually organise crap , it's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , you know ?
D :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Little different .
A :  But you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ?
D :  Yeah . I except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand and I knew we were all lying through our teeth , other than that
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  I had to admit , as soon as w we started I mean as soon as we got the Play-Doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window .
D :  I could only imagine .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Maybe in in Legos you know ? Be fun with Legos too , like make a remote control or spaceship , we used to have spaceship Legos did you guys ever used to build spaceships with Legos everybody knows best spaceships ever . Um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ?
C :  Possibly .
C :  Oh yeah , still have 'em .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Totally .
B :  Yeah ?
D :  I think so .
C :  Yep .
A :  Hmm .
B :  You don't .
A :  No I , no I dunno , I d I I dunno , I don't I I was just I
D :  Though we didn't actually I mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , but I feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board well and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings .
B :  Yeah .
A :  It's true huh ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  I mean I think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team .
D :  That's true .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Course I'm I'm conscious of the idea of the Project Manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like , kind of like , like hmm . It d
D :  Yeah that is kind of
A :  But yeah . Interesting . It's kind of fascinating wasn't it ? I mean the whole process of
B :  Wonder why is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ?
A :  I don't know . I I don't know if there was a ri I th
D :  Mine was the mics . I didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , I was afraid I was gonna break something actually .
B :  Yeah , that's it 'cause the mics are loose and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well I dunno what I woulda shown on that board .
D :  Yeah .
D :  True , but it didn't even occur to me as an option , I mean I don't know that I would have but I know that I consciously didn't .
A :  Nor I .
C :  I mean it's just like the paper I don't know what I really needed the paper for . Um , because I've got this laptop . Standard , I just used it 'cause it's literally right in front of me .
D :  True .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I wanna see the output files from these um , from the digital paper . I wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized because my handwriting is crap . I mean , just to see what it looks like in P_D_F_ format or something .
D :  Well it looks really professional .
D :  I know .
B :  Yeah , that's it .
B :  Usually I would do a lot more doodling too but I didn't because
D :  I know , I felt like I needed to be professional so I didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . Okay , well not entirely , but still , I doodled less than I usually do .
A :  T I I'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . You know , like what is the uh
A :  what exactly we're looking for here .
C :  So is this all we need to get through ?
D :  I guess .
A :  I dunno , I'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about .
D :  Um . It did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ?
B :  New ideas .
C :  Is it
A :  Well , that's the thing I got i in the email I got this PowerPoint file but this slide was just there , mm-hmm . I didn't change this one at all .
D :  That slide was like that ?
B :  Hmm .
D :  Well .
B :  I guess we're on the right track .
A :  Um ch
A :  Yeah well .
C :  Any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ?
A :  W I kinda like th
B :  No , none .
D :  Uh I think they still do their job .
B :  I think they're fine actually .
A :  Yeah you can't
D :  I am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form I don't
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , maybe a s a circle would be alright , different .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Does kinda make you wonder , I mean , how much can you do with a remote control ? It's like inventing a new car . Yeah yeah , you can
D :  It's still gotta be technically car shaped or it won't fit on the road , you know ?
A :  Yeah .
D :  Don't know .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Um . 'Kay .
C :  What is that ? Our limited ability to think outside the box ?
D :  Kind of .
A :  So this was other costs .
B :  Are we back into project mood ?
A :  I dunno . I think this is
D :  Oh , how long was our meeting supposed to be ? How much time do we have left ?
A :  forty ish I I I mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval , um .
A :  I dunno about you guys but I felt like
A :  a bit
A :  under-stimulated on the whole thing . Like , what like you know what am I really doing , you know what is
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , at the beginning it started out and I felt actually like under pressure like the first couple were taking a lot of work and I was like had like all this brainstorming I was doing and then suddenly I was like well it's just another two minute presentation that you guys don't really care about anyway so type away . You know , you know what I mean like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore .
A :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Why ? Huh I think it was the real .
A :  Hey .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Definitely when when I first filled out the questionnaire I was marking it probably higher in terms of how much I had to how much I stressed over it and then by the time I got to the last one I was like , you know , not very much .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Whatever . Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Very much , yeah .
A :  I actually didn't do that at all though , every single one I a all the presentations I either added slides or edited 'em . I di
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Oh I added like five slides too , but I
D :  See I only got blank ones .
A :  Oh .
B :  Did you really ? I just got blank ones and
A :  What ? Really ?
D :  My slides were all blank , they'd have a title maybe and they were just empty .
C :  Yeah , mine too .
B :  Me too .
A :  Did they not have they didn't like uh mine yeah they didn't come like this ? Like with this was what it looks like . This is what that looked like , literally , just like that . Interesting .
D :  Like with those words already on it ?
D :  No .
C :  No .
D :  I wondered why yours always looked so more complicated .
A :  Uh-huh huh huh .
B :  I deleted slides .
D :  I think I added a slide one time .
C :  I added many slides every time Yeah .
D :  Hey with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class .
B :  That was pretty cool , it was a high moment of the whole experiment .
D :  Mm .
C :  Um .
A :  Interesting .
A :  Any other thoughts come to mind ?
D :  I wanna know how our product would fare . I can't just leave it there . I think it would take extensive marketing , okay , an apple with a red button on top , even I am sceptical . But you know the whole
B :  I think it would fail , I think
B :  it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that .
C :  Even you .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I don't we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face .
D :  I know it is .
A :  Yeah but
B :  It's a happy face .
C :  Actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications .
D :  Mm .
A :  Builds .
A :  Mm .
C :  I hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random Kit-Kat bar that happened to be consumed .
D :  I I noticed that . By accident .
A :  Interesting .
D :  Well huh . An interesting day all in all I would say .
B :  Yeah , it's uh
A :  Uh , yeah , I'd say so .
C :  So again I reiterate my question of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not .
D :  I know .
A :  Mm , I know .
C :  Mm .
A :  It seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . You know from the the the basics to the conce although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , I don't think I really understood like the concept . Well the id okay the notion of yeah I mean i it's not like I have a concept of a mug's material , it's just it is what it is . You know , maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh I I thought of I thought of rather than in terms of concepts I thought of it in terms of um like
B :  I wanna see a
D :  Yeah .
D :  'Cause it's such a functional item .
B :  Yeah .
A :  proposed idea . And then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever , I dunno . But .
D :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
A :  All in all it's kinda interesting .
D :  Mm .
B :  So we have more slides or ?
A :  No just this closing one . No we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , but we could s you know do it
D :  We got it to be .
A :  We did the project evaluation based on um Sarah's evaluation of on off switches and
D :  Like cutting corners .
D :  Kind of , though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general .
A :  Mm . True .
B :  Mm .
D :  Which I'm not sure is the same thing , at the time that just i made more sense , but I could see if they were really asking about us .
A :  Yeah .
A :  'Cause we di we had a thu think about it . Um .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And it's all recorded , woo-hoo . Yeah what I'm gonna I'm gonna put um I'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end so I'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but I'll put most of it in the reports .
D :  Yay .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Make it sound eloquent .
B :  It'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording .
D :  Oh , I have to done I've I've done transcription before and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that that mean nothing .
A :  Nice .
A :  Oh yeah .
A :  There's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics .
B :  Really .
C :  What the uhs and the
D :  There's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something . Yeah .
B :  Filler words or ?
A :  Yep , they're called um disfluencies .
B :  Disfluencies .
D :  That's a good word for it .
A :  Yeah we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things .
D :  Just add some prefixes , sounds classier .
A :  Exactly uh I will save this into the
A :  project documents .
B :  I find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , like c come on gimme something .
A :  Yeah . Oh yeah . Yeah I know . Come on give me some information . Well to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet , so I mean I do the
C :  Mm .
D :  I , yeah , pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah .
D :  Yeah , we are addicts .
C :  That's scary yeah ?
B :  It is scary .
D :  Mm .
C :  Well just around that eight or or nine people that are
A :  I know , imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . It's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? I mean , you know , it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I yeah .
C :  Dude , I think we've had internet for like eighteen years .
D :  True .
A :  No we have but I not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous
D :  I yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  But it's not regular I mean my grandparents had it in the eighties and I got it in ninety four , but still .
B :  It's crazy . So
D :  Uh-huh .
C :  In the eighties ?
D :  My um grammy does computer science back in the States and so they had um an E_D_U_ and gov network . There's basically the fundamental structures , but it wasn't uh household to household yet because it hadn't been
A :  Mm .
C :  Right .
C :  Yeah , it was to the like seven universities or something .
D :  partitioned off and stuff , yeah that was him .
C :  You guys ready to celebrate ?
A :  Yeah that's our last step . Celebration .
D :  Apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ?
B :  Should .
D :  I think so .
A :  'Kay I guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . Cool .
D :  I think that's a closer .
B :  Has it been forty minutes or whatever ? this has been long enough .
C :  Celebrate .
A :  Where do you find that ?
D :  I have no idea .
B :  Is that the only song you have ?
C :  There is another one .
A :  Is this one of those media player ?
C :  Huh ? Yep .
A :  W oh . The default track . I thought it was David Burns , look into the eyeball . That's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , maybe this is the new version .
B :  That's awesome .
B :  Maybe I have a different one .
D :  So is that a close ?
A :  Yeah , I guess we'll call that a a doner . Fab .
D :  Okay , that's the end of the meeting .
D :  Thank you gentlemen .
D :  I feel like I'm signing off .
D :  I wanna find our if our remote works .
A :  Me too .
D :  Oh .
A :  Okay . Um here's the agenda for our last meeting . Um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation , then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . Then we're going to evaluate the product and I think the whole production process , and then we're gonna close it up , and we have forty minutes , so
D :  Whoohoo .
A :  let's get started . Oh , no , let's have the prototype presentation .
B :  Mm 'kay , you ready ?
C :  Um sure . You or me ?
B :  Y you read that stuff , since you wrote it .
C :  Okay . Well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , I'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . The base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , and it's gonna be plastic . Um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . Um because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . Um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . Um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through . It's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow . The whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up .
B :  I'll be the Vanna .
A :  Right .
A :  Hmm .
D :  That's nice .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Good .
C :  Um and then at the bottom we have our logo . Um bright yellow sort of design with the R_R_ which will actually look like our logo . And then on the side you have the buttons . They're one button , but they kind of push up and down .
A :  Great .
A :  Okay .
C :  I don't think they're scrolling .
B :  No .
B :  They're just buttons .
C :  Right , yeah . And then yeah , the buttons .
B :  On off switch will be here and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of , by concave sort of thing , except for , you know , can't see underneath . So I'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , because they're very
D :  Yeah .
B :  nice to stock you know , stick your finger in . Um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , and then these are the numbers , so our channel and our volume will be on either side .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Thumb-shaped .
C :  Yeah . And then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , just which we didn't do .
A :  Okay . And did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ?
B :  I'd say a single .
A :  Single . Single sounds good , 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double .
C :  Single .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , it's only actually the size of my hand .
C :  Right .
A :  Great . Great . I think you did an awesome job . It is beautiful , and it's everything that we discussed .
D :  Yeah , I think it's a beautiful
D :  Yeah .
D :  Good job , you guys . Those are really good .
B :  Whoohoo .
C :  Oh thank you .
A :  Good job .
A :  Alright what's next in our agenda ?
A :  Um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , and that's with Courtney .
D :  Okay , it's a PowerPoint presentation . I don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about . It's under evaluation .
A :  Right .
D :  Alright . Um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , is it easy to use , is it fashionable uh yeah , I guess we should write these down so we can reference them .
A :  Mm .
C :  Feel good meaning what ? Physically , okay .
D :  Like does it feel good , like yeah , physically .
A :  Right .
A :  Sqi
D :  That's just for current trend . It doesn't really count , you guys .
A :  Right .
B :  Yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But it's so we do have removable covers , right ? Yeah , well then that's covered . And so we n k everybody have that ?
A :  Right .
B :  Yes .
A :  'Kay .
A :  I'll wait .
D :  Yeah , she's got it .
D :  It's good . Yeah . Okay so , we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale , and so we need to discuss how we feel . It falls within this range , so for easy to use ,
C :  Yeah .
D :  do we feel it's very easy to use ?
C :  True or false , easy to use .
A :  Are we going to indi I say we individually rate what do you say ? Just orally . Why not ? We have okay .
D :  You guys
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Um easy to use . I vote six .
D :  Oh wait , that's false .
A :  Oh , two .
D :  Okay .
B :  I'd say two as well .
C :  Yeah , two .
D :  Two . That's what I say .
A :  Uh hello , we're great .
D :  Okay , fashionable ?
A :  Um one .
B :  At the moment , no .
D :  No . I mean like no , I think it's very fashionable .
A :  No . Me too , very chic .
D :  I thi I would give it a one .
B :  Okay . I'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way .
A :  One , I give it a one .
D :  Well , that's that's just like that's a clay , it's a prototype . What do you think ?
A :  Oh , and ma it's a prototype , right .
C :  Mm I don't think it's that fashionable . I'd give it like three or four .
A :  Well , now I'm . So , the average is about a two .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , it's a two .
C :  But then I'm not fashionable , so
A :  Two or three . Two point five .
C :  don't use my opinion .
D :  That's okay . Yeah . Um
B :  Neither are all o all the customers we have , either .
D :  does it feel good ?
A :  Imagine , since we obviously don't have that .
C :  Does it feel good ?
D :  I feel like
B :  Uh the shape of it actually does uh .
A :  And it's i it is very ergonomically designed . It's gonna be curved .
C :  Yeah , it's gonna be thicker .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Depth .
D :  I think it feels good .
A :  I think so too .
D :  I'll give it a two .
A :  'Kay . Two .
C :  I'll give it a one .
D :  What do you say ?
B :  I'd say a two .
A :  Alright , average is two .
D :  Okay .
A :  Is it technologically innovative ? Oh sorry I'm taking over your job here . Go right ahead .
D :  Oh no , it's fine , you're I mean you're Project Manager . Um yeah , I mean and it does it have voice I mean the phrase recognition on it ?
A :  Yes . Right ? We were able to do it with that kind of chip .
C :  Oh right , the
B :  We could do it with the chip , yes . It wasn't we have no reflection of it on the prototype , but that's because it's only two dimensions , really .
D :  And there's no way you can represent it on here . Y
A :  Yeah , right . That was 'kay . And we discussed that being included .
D :  Yeah , so . Then yes , then I would well it isn't what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ?
C :  Right .
B :  It
A :  Well we don' have the you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight .
D :  And it doesn't cover anything other then T_V_ , so I'd probably give it a three .
A :  Right .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  Even though it is for just a T_V_ remote it's uh very advanced . But it is just a T_V_ remote .
A :  Yeah . I'd go for a three or four on that one , so okay , let's go for a three point five .
C :  Yeah I go four .
B :  Three and an half .
A :  Alright , and the last criteria is it is it um
C :  Squishy and fruity . It's just trendy , basically .
D :  Well yeah , so I'd give it a two .
A :  Well , we've covered that with the trendy .
B :  It's capable of being squishy and fruity .
A :  Sure . Capable . Very capable .
D :  Oh , it's very capable of being squishy and fruity .
C :  Okay .
A :  And it's very important . 'Kay , there we go . So .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , next .
A :  Next .
D :  So um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , and uh hopefully we'll sell millions . Good job , team .
B :  How did you get that in there ? The slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . That was good .
D :  What ?
A :  It does . Very good . Alright , let's go back to this
D :  It it does .
D :  Thanks .
A :  No , that's it . Hmm .
A :  Oops .
A :  Okay , so now uh we're moving on to finance , okay . I'm gonna show you an Excel spreadsheet and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty Euro . If so , we can proceed , if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit . 'Kay ? So let me bring that up .
A :  Here we go . Alright . Um it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a
B :  Yep .
D :  Two .
A :  Number of components you plan to use . Do I just put quantity being one battery , or
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . But if it's a do you wanna go for this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple A_s , 'cause triple A_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . Oh , let's just go for a lithium . What do you say ? I think uh I think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically right . Okay , down to the electronics um section . We're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , so one of those .
B :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Yeah , let's let's do a lithium .
C : 
B :  Yeah , it's .
D :  We're gon that's gon
D :  Nologically advanced , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
A :  It is a single-curved , so one of those .
D :  Uh .
A :  Oh . What's that ? Yeah , that's correct . 'Kay , down here , case material . Plastic .
D :  Yeah .
C :  It's plastic .
D :  We plastic .
D :  And special colour .
C :  And special colour .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Down here , interface type . We're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel . Isn't oh those are just regular buttons .
C :  No , we don't have the scroll . Buttons .
D :  But it's
B :  Well , that's the push-button too , right there .
D :  Yeah , but i so i
A :  This ?
B :  Integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . We're really having just push-button interface .
A :  Okay , so we can just go um .
D :  But will we w actually we'll need two , won't we ? One for the top and then one for the s one e for each side .
B :  But it that just covers the type of button we're having . Because we're not doing a scroll on the side , it's still push-button .
C :  Oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and
B :  Push-button . But we just have push
C :  push-buttons . But we don't have any scrolls .
A :  Right I think she's I think what Courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ?
D :  Okay .
D :  Like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . There's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides . So is that gonna be an extra one on each side ?
A :  Right .
B :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  I don't know , they might put us well , let's just .
C :  Two interfaces , is that what w should we s say ?
A :  Two or would it be three ?
B :  Let's call it th
D :  Or three , because of one on each side and one on top . I mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine . Well less than twenty nine even .
C :  Okay , fine . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay and we're gonna button supplements the buttons are no uh okay .
D :  They're a special colour .
D :  Um they're uh they're a special form , 'cause they're indented .
A :  Are they ?
A :  Oh , right .
C :  And then s yeah .
D :  And , they're a special material .
A :  Mm . Well , we're under cost then .
A :  Alright . No , we're under . Twelve point five is our limit . We've got eleven point two .
C :  We're over ?
B :  Grand .
D :  We're under .
C :  Okay .
C :  Oh , I see .
B :  So we can go to production .
A :  Alright .
A :  We can go to
A :  I dunno what I just did .
A :  Okay . Now we're gonna talk about the project process um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result . Um did we have a lot of room for creativity ? Did we have a lot of room for individual leadership , um teamwork , and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , and if we found any new ideas . Now , question is , how do we do this ?
B :  Go back .
D :  I think we just discuss it .
A :  Discuss , sure .
B :  Previous .
A :  Alright . Who want who would like to go first ?
B :  We think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a T_V_ remote , initially .
C :  We didn't have a whiteboard .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah . And no internet .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Oh that's true .
D :  Yeah .
D :  No , yeah , that's a good point . 'Cause I'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision , yeah .
A :  And how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ?
D :  Oh , overall I mean I thought we did a good job like
D :  We got to choose basically we had control over minus it being just merely a T_V_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it .
A :  Right , and we got say over
A :  what how technologically advanced it should be and also how fashionable , which I kind of like we yep .
D :  And we're a fashion forward technology company .
B :  right .
A :  You know it .
A :  Um what about um the teamwork aspect ? How did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  I think we did well .
A :  I think ya' did . Did you work well together in there , and 'kay .
C :  Yep .
B :  Well , no , there was there was scratching and fighting , but no .
D :  Minus that one fight . Yeah .
C :  Gouges .
A :  Oh my God , and we've all been a pretty congenial team here , I think . We hadn't had any ma fallings out .
D :  Yeah . I mean minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? Irritating , yeah . Wow that's a it's definitely a strong one .
A :  Irritating .
B :  Irritating .
C :  Irritating .
A :  Okay .
B :  The means , the whiteboard didn't work .
D :  Yeah .
C :  And no internet .
A :  Yeah . I have to knock that one down a couple notches .
B :  A and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet .
D :  Yeah , and no internet .
C :  Misses . I do . There's so much available . Like it's information
D :  And the digital the digital pens were they were pretty cool . Yeah they were fun , even though I'm not really sure what I could do with them , but they are awesome .
A :  Yeah , digital pens . They were fine .
B :  I really appreciated those , yeah .
B :  The use of the laptops for receiving everything . It was wireless too , so .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Right , laptops are extremely handy , wireless . And that we have a shared network where we can put all of the
D :  And these things whoa .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear .
D :  Yeah . And Big Brother .
A :  Big brother .
D :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ?
D :  Um we are really gonna sell this . Ta-da .
A :  For something that looks cool and also has what I want it to b do technologically . And that's your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know . If we all just went out and bought useful things , I don't think I mean that's not what technology .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well , that's why I don't like uh Macs or Apples , just 'cause I look at it , and I know it's probably a very good computer , but I look at it , and I'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same . They look like they did when I was in elementary school , and that's so old-fashioned to me .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , 'cause they're pretty and just like
B :  The Toronto district school would only use his Macs with their kids .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Exactly , so I associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad
A :  Yeah .
A :  Just the Mac font bothers me even . But I do like iPods , go figure .
D :  Uh yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , no , iPods They want all those words for presentation , even the plugs .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Well , i iPods are now quite trendy , and they come in different colours . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Colours . Exactly . I mean how many people went out and bough a Nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates .
D :  Oh yeah , everybody .
A :  Okay . Anyway , so that is definitely at work .
B :  Not me . I didn't have a phone 'til university .
D :  Mine is amber . Oh .
C :  But the my but my one issue is just like the whole it's for T_V_ only . I was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the T_V_ unless they've lost theirs .
D :  Look at it . That is a piece of work . Wow . Marketing Director says yeah .
A :  Yeah . Fashionable chic people will .
C :  You're kidding .
C :  No , no . No , marketing has to actually create the desire for it .
D :  Fashionable people will buy it .
D :  Oh , I will create desire .
B :  That's okay . We can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met . This will help them find the one . That's right .
C :  Ri They'll be sexy with it .
A :  Hmm .
D :  We could have like an Adam and Eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf . Mm . That'll sell .
C :  Oh right .
B :  And so the serpent says , use our remote .
A :  There you go , marketing .
C :  Let you loose .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . Okay , we're gonna wrap this up now . Um the costs are within the budget , we evaluated the project , and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so . Alright , thank you team , you did a great job , it was lovely working with you .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , no .
B :  Whoohoo . Margaritas for everyone .
C :  Good .
D :  You too .
B :  Yay . Thanks to the Project Leader .
B :  Now we know w
A :  'Kay .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Okay everybody . Welcome to the detailed design meeting . Um
A :  Let's see . Our agenda . Last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . Um and I think looks like we've come up with some ideas . Um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . Um so for later in the meeting I've done a a spreadsheet of production costs so we'll take a look at that . Um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . Um so actually I think
A :  Yeah um f you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of
B :  Okay well um . So our design looks something like this .
B :  This being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . This is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it I think it brings up the menu .
B :  And uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . So you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever . And it comes yeah , I can change the vegetable . This one's broccoli . So this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . This is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it .
C :  You could change the vegetable , or fruit .
A :  Oh is that broccoli ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  This is a mango . The it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits . You don't have orange , you have mango . Um I guess strawberry's not as trendy , but
A :  'S a very bright strawberry .
B :  So we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control .
C :  It's been a l
B :  And then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out .
C :  It's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . Uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow . And I guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the um thing the locator . How how so
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  Well the locator is just chip that's inside there .
C :  Okay so that's just
B :  And the beeper's also inside there too somewhere .
C :  So you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the
B :  Yeah we didn't design that .
C :  Yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed .
B :  But it would be coordinating with that of course .
C :  Yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  You could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango .
C :  So . Tada .
A :  Oh .
A :  Um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an Excel spreadsheet .
A :  Um the only one that's in there , production costs . And if you open it up . Um I've just stuck the numbers in , it was a real challenge there . But if I missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed I mean , we decided on batteries , and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced iPod-like button . Um
A :  I said uncurved or flat . I think that's what you have there , is that right ? For the for the plastic part would be
B :  My impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes .
B :  But it's really not very clear , because you got single curve and double curve and d I dunno what that means . One side is curved and then the other side is curved .
A :  Oh . Okay .
A :  Right .
A :  Well yeah . If we're talking about the area just oh I d
A :  I dunno . I guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . Um so what else ? There's plastic for that area around the button . Um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ? Um and lots of special colours actually . Uh scroll wheel . Do you see anything that I've missed ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  No I think that's alright .
A :  Okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit . And if we sold a lot of squishy things . Boo yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
A :  S
A :  So
A :  Mm .
A :  Did y what did you work on ? The
D :  Um evaluation criteria . I've got a presentation .
A :  Okay . Do you wanna
A :  Okay . I think that's
D :  So I need where's the cable ?
D :  Right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole
D :  this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start .
D :  Um .
D :  Right .
D :  This doesn't okay . Um the method is we well I've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . And um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , and this is everything's listed down .
D :  Um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . These are all things we looked at at the start , um and criteria that have to be met . We have to use a table , I'll show you that later , together to decide whether it meets the standards . And we we have therefore in total um
D :  We have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . And um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . I would like to show you the table we have to use . Um .
D :  No . This is the table . Can you see this here ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um so the que the questions I've given you c could you write that down ? True is one and and false is seven . And we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . Um .
D :  I think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . I dunno how it works exactly , I haven't been told .
C :  Yeah . Is it possible that we can bring this up on our own
D :  Yeah it's in the um
D :  it's in the project documents .
C :  Is it meeting three minutes ? No it's not minutes .
D :  It's called evaluation criteria .
C :  Okay .
D :  And it's
D :  under evaluation .
A :  Huh , the PowerPoint one ?
B :  Hmm ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Cool .
D :  You've found it all ?
A :  Yeah .
D :  So it was um
D :  Yeah true's one .
C :  True's one and false is seven .
D :  Do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ?
A :  Um we can do it separately and then discuss it if if that's what people wanna do .
D :  Yeah okay .
C :  So it's actually a scale .
A :  Wait , one is true and so these are the questions we're answering . And one is
D :  Um ,
D :  yes it's if it's fancy you put one , if it's really unfancy it's seven .
A :  One , right okay .
A :  If it's somewhere in between you put four . Okay .
D :  Yeah , something .
C :  Okay .
C :  Does it feel fancy ? No .
B :  Feels like play-dough .
D :  They shouldn't really be questions . Should be more like
D :  Are the batteries easy to insert ?
B :  I'm gonna say yes .
D :  Yes ? Very very true . Okay .
B :  I imagine they're somewhere on the front . We have a little case that you slip 'em in .
D :  Okay .
A :  Are we just about ready ?
D :  Apparently I'm supposed to use the whiteboard . Do we um is it necessary ?
A :  I don't think so . It's yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we
D :  We'll just do um
C :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  Our animals will forever be there .
A :  Un unless you feel you need it t to okay okay . We'll
D :  I don't feel any right um
D :  Right so one point one ? We'll just go in a circle .
C :  One .
D :  Right . Ooh I don't know . Right . One ?
B :  Five .
B :  Five .
A :  Five .
D :  Five . Two . Okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? Is that what the company does ?
A :  I I think we should
B :  It's four if you wanna do that .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah ?
B :  It adds to sixteen , so that's four .
D :  Oh no . It adds to thirteen . One five five two .
B :  Oh I thought she said five .
C :  Hmm .
D :  One five five two is thirteen , over four for now . I think that's um next ?
C :  Um three .
B :  Six .
A :  Six . I wasn't cheating I swear .
D :  Really ? Two . Uh-oh .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Right . One point three is
C :  So it's a one was true and seven was false ?
C :  Okay , so you guys really didn't like it ?
A :  Uh .
B :  Huh ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  I really
A :  Oh I thought it was the other way round . So we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way
B :  Wait a minute . I thought it was the other way round too .
D :  Well uh
B :  Yeah I I was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top .
D :  Yeah yeah . It was one is true and false is seven . I should've kept the table up .
A :  Oh gosh . Okay . Well
B :  I'll just I'll just reverse them all . It's no problem .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Right , well I'm glad this came out .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ? Yeah .
B :  I thought you guys hated it .
D :  Yeah . No . Oh that's quite funny .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . So , starting again , one point one ?
C :  One .
B :  Say two .
A :  Three .
D :  Two . Okay , one point two ?
C :  Uh three .
B :  Two .
A :  Two .
D :  Two . Okay . Um , one point three ?
C :  One .
A :  One .
B :  One .
D :  Ha . Two point one ?
C :  Uh two .
A :  Two .
B :  Uh two .
A :  Two point I think I missed two . Wait , is that two point one ?
B :  Yeah I put it down as one point four for some reason .
D :  Yeah . Oh dear , okay . Sorry .
A :  One point four , one point five . Okay right that's I have two of them .
B :  Mine has all kinds of problems .
D :  Two and one . Sorry about that . T two point two , which is one point five .
A :  One .
B :  Uh three .
B :  Wait why did I put three ?
C :  Uh one .
B :  I meant one on mine too .
D :  Okay .
D :  Three point one . Is that correct on my slide ? Yeah ?
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Uh one .
B :  Three point one . I have four .
D :  One , four , three , three , three point two ?
A :  Three .
B :  Three .
A :  Three .
C :  Uh . One .
D :  Three point three .
C :  One .
B :  One .
A :  Two .
D :  Four point one ?
C :  One .
B :  Two .
A :  Five .
D :  Two . Four point two .
C :  Two .
B :  Three .
A :  Four .
D :  Two and four point three .
B :  Two .
D :  One , two .
C :  One .
A :  Two .
D :  Right so I put one on that . Okay I'll um I'll just do the calculations now if you want to continue . Or is it tedious ? I'm I'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone .
A :  Okay . Um
A :  No no that's um I think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four , where um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote .
D :  I didn't know how else to do it .
D :  Okay . Well the worst ones were three point one .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Do does every ones have the slide ? Three point one .
A :  The that was material .
D :  Slide show .
D :  Material technologically innovative , okay . Um , do you want to change it ? What are the suggestions ? I don't know , anyone ?
A :  Mm .
C :  Which one is that again sorry ? Three point one ?
A :  Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah that it's three point one was not that good . Four point one .
A :  Does the shape
D :  The shape . Four point two ?
C :  I think
A :  See I'm having I'm having trouble imagining
A :  the is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ? It or bigger ?
B :  I think the wheel would probably be mm .
A :  Because
C :  What if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? And like then it you could hold it in your hand better .
B :  I think the base would definitely be larger , 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . They're kinda smallish .
A :  Yeah .
A :  No but I imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers . Um but I don't s I I personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position .
C :  Yeah . The flat one . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I didn't yeah . But like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat
B :  Well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable .
C :  But it's still too big I think , in your hand . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And would it even resemble fruit that way ? I mean
C :  Yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection , like you could probably do a strawberry still . I think the broccoli would be out .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  You could do , although the broccoli is quite comfortable , I have to say , like sorta like a joystick .
A :  Yeah that I I when you were holding that before , it actually looked yeah .
D :  Yeah . That looked really good .
C :  I don't know . So
D :  Are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ?
C :  Uh .
B :  Not that I can think of . Rhubarb .
D :  I think that broccoli is my favourite actually . Uh despite the
C :  Rhubarb . These obscure fruits .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I think we needn't
A :  What if um the it was just patterns on like we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber .
C :  Huh ? Oh okay .
A :  You know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah .
B :  So it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry .
C :  Yeah . That could work .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Or I mean we could even have fruit like around I mean
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . I dunno .
D :  Yeah and just have the colour match or something .
A :  But if we if we need yeah . And if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , there might be I mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the
C :  Yeah . 'Cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
C :  Or like I dunno , some of 'em you can kind of think see as like
C :  like you could if it was only this you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . But you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So like maybe that's just too big because
A :  Well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , which is a nice kind of yeah .
C :  Yeah it's sorta like a joystick .
D :  Yeah .
A :  But
C :  I dunno . I guess
A :  I mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ? 'Cause like kind of
B :  We could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits . We went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough .
A :  Yeah , yeah . Or like even
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Or even like
A :  Yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . You know ?
C :  Yeah . Yeah . Like uh we could do I'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped .
A :  'Cause that , I think
A :  I mean that fits the whole round iPod idea . And you still have the comfort of holding it like that .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  And you could like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Alright .
A :  But I mean it do we have any other ideas about that ?
D :  Um
C :  We could tr I don't know .
D :  Think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one . .
D :  Batteries easy to insert for some reason , which can be easily I think that's not a problem any more .
A :  The batteries are going in the back ?
B :  That everyone gave that a one or a two .
B :  Yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote .
D :  No .
A :  The reason I I ga I didn't give it a one I think I gave it a three because I thought you'd have to like unc clip no you could
B :  No I imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door , yeah um like on a normal remote .
A :  Just like any other one . Okay . Yeah .
A :  Right .
B :  So it would probably either in the f no it can't be in the front 'cause the I_R_'s right there , but it'd be on one of the sides probably .
A :  Okay .
D :  I think everyone's under three anyway .
A :  Mm .
D :  So I think it's yeah those are the only two points .
C :  Cool . Well
C :  Yeah the broccoli I guess wins .
B :  Yeah I'd agree with changing the shape . Um , I was just having fun making strawberries and stuff .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  We were a bit off task . Um so uh I can't think of any
C :  So we'll have to like
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah I dunno .
C :  You could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , but you could do like
B :  It might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape .
C :  Yeah that's true . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular .
C :  Yeah that's true .
C :  Mm .
B :  I bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Not really
A :  Well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . Um so project evaluation .
D :  Do you want this and we can all
D :  No .
A :  I guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied oh , oh it's alright . Uh . Yeah . Um
D :  It's alright yeah ?
A :  Did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of
B :  Sure .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I did .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I mean fruit and squishiness . How c more creative can you get ?
B :  Sponginess .
C :  The prototype making was very creatively stimulating and I think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria .
A :  And how was our leadership and teamwork ?
B :  I think it was good . We knew what we were doing . It was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute .
A :  Well I thought my leadership was crap personally . Excuse me , am I allowed to say that ? Yeah . Um .
B :  Well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters .
C :  I think you were fine . You did a good job leading .
A :  Yeah , well I'm never gonna do a management position , I know that now . Um yeah , I thought we all worked very well together .
D :  Yeah we didn't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah I think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like I don't know , all had ideas about it but yeah .
A :  Yeah . Very democratic .
A :  No spats , that was good . Um and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ?
C :  No .
A :  Like the the pens , the whiteboard , I mean we used
B :  Well I'm not a big fan of any Microsoft , PowerPoint or any of this stuff . No no I never touch Macs either . I just use the Unix or the off market , sort of WordPerfect and all these other things .
A :  Are you a Mac person ?
A :  Huh .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Which isn't very user-friendly though .
B :  Yeah . Well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has WordPerfect so I have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then I have to reinstall it . So I have all these documents I can't use now .
B :  But yeah I mean I guess it's okay .
C :  I felt like my I dunno if it was just my role , but l but uh I di I thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like or maybe it was just the idea that we had . But there's kinda it was kinda like okay , I don't really think I dunno what I'm doing here . So I didn't really think it was helpful . So I kind of just made up my own stuff and I didn't really like the PowerPoint presentations , so I kind of wrote a lot of notes instead . But yeah I d I don't really like PowerPoint personally , think it's kinda stupid .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . I never use it .
C :  Yeah but uh
A :  I can't say I found everything particularly helpful . Like I
C :  Yeah . It didn't really yeah .
B :  Yeah . My first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works .
A :  It
D :  I though it was brilliant no ?
A :  Really ?
D :  No mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful I think . I think it depends on the role no ?
C :  So like a f
A :  I mean m my problem yeah , yeah . 'Cause my problem was , you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff right ? See I couldn't do that , so I didn't really know what you guys were doing . And when you were talking about it I was just like you know that's wh that's why I seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things , 'cause I
B :  Yeah it probably does .
C :  Yeah I think so .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah well mine was mostly made up except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control . As if you'd wanted to .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . But it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um
A :  Yeah .
A :  System . Yeah .
D :  a whole system , 'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the
C :  Yeah I mean , it
A :  Yeah .
B :  Well I think it's interesting how it all went together , like I had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , and you have how people want it to be spongy , and
D :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah , huh .
B :  It seems planned you know .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah I kinda thought that um I felt like I would go and like try to use my information , or like I'd make this stupid little presentation and then like I just would end up talking about something completely unrelated because I dunno I felt like I was off-task all the time . But um
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well I mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit like it wasn't necessarily what was like we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ? So it's
B :  Yeah . If I hadn't been told that fruit was
D :  No .
C :  Yeah .
D :  But I think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing .
A :  Oh right . given certain information or
D :  Yeah , like if everyone's given the same input I don't have a clue , anyway . Um what's next ? Looks like oh no that's not um
A :  Just yeah .
A :  Mm , mm .
D :  It's quite
A :  What do you guys think of the pens ? It asks about that .
B :  They're pretty cool . They're kinda hard to write with though .
A :  Mm .
C :  I wanna s
A :  Yeah and I I've f forgotten once or twice to check the box .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I I'd like to see what what it looks like on the
B :  They're nicer than the pen that I'm using , because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write .
A :  Mm .
B :  But even so , I dunno .
A :  And new ideas found ? Yeah .
D :  Yeah it's all very new , no ?
D :  It's all very new .
C :  Yeah I think I'd like to um
C :  I dunno .
C :  Like it was the I think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down , but like they're kinda clumsy I guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like .
D :  Sorry .
B :  Oh yeah .
B :  Well they drop off if you like move too much .
C :  Yeah I dunno . But they're they're okay .
B :  But I don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones . Maybe we are . I don't know .
C :  Uh I think , and I think that uh
A :  Mm .
C :  all this technology like I guess some people must be interested in using it but I can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes , or like I dunno .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Well the thing is , like I actually worked in a company , and I had a role and I had to go to meetings . And like the last thing I would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause I missed a meeting . Like usually I missed meetings deliberately . There's just there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company . It's mostly like rehashing old stuff . And you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know . It's like the there's just really not a lot of information that goes through .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Hm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Seems kind of like an excessive reiteration . Yeah .
B :  It seems like way overkill . Like if I missed a meeting I could probably get it summed up in like one sentence . I wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I guess it would be
C :  it's gotta be worth it to I 'cause I'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , 'cause
C :  can't really imagine , dunno .
C :  How about a p a ?
C :  Um I dunno .
A :  Well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ? Any other ideas for
D :  What what's the end ? Are we are we supposed to um you supposed to write a report ? Or we ending ? Is that the end ?
A :  Um we still have time if there's any other input . I mean the I think we did really well personally , which is why we've
A :  you know , gone through this so quickly . 'Cause I mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy . So .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
D :  End of meeting . You have to tell her , she
A :  So I think that's all for today .
D :  Okay we have to fill in all this stuff . Stuff stuff stuff .
C :  M meeting adjourned .
A :  Meeting adjourned .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I think I've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I think it would be a good idea , I like it .
B :  It's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . Especially if you have food .
A :  So I guess we're supposed to write final reports . 'Cause
B :  All of us ?
A :  I don't know . Hmm .
D :  Well there's al eight , nine . Ooh .
D :  Oh ooh .
A :  Hmm . Or is that just me ?
A :  Right well .
A :  Welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here and uh
A :  we'll just go through the the final uh the final details . Um okay , oh the um
A :  th the the minutes of the last meeting uh I think we'll take those as read , um
A :  Okay the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance and then uh
A :  uh just tidy up with production and um and then we can close . Um
A :  So f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals .
B :  Uh okay we basically have the same kinda lay-out here it's just um you hold it like this and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . Um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda so you can hold it and scroll , or you can hold it and and push . Uh this is the power key , um it's kinda like the biggest so you know how to turn on .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  Uh that's the little menu key . This is the infra-red section so you g it'll be sending rays and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . Uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands so you can you know talk to it like that and it'll still understand . Um the logo is down down there um and has the cover on it and you can see like it just kinda goes the red bit's the cover and it kinda goes over everything and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . Um .
A :  Yep , yeah , good , good .
A :  Uh-huh . Yep , right .
A :  Uh-huh .
C :  Mm . S
A :  Yep , yep , mm-hmm .
C :  And so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , just kind of a light non-descript grey so that people'll wanna buy the covers and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make iPod covers , so they kinda just stretch over .
B :  Mm .
A :  Uh-huh . Yep yep .
A :  Yep .
A :  showing me age , I don't know what i c iPod covers are like . Yeah yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , well I I didn't know that but yeah they're kind of it's just kind of a rubbery and that way you know spongy like is something that people wanted and it just sort of stretches over and that way I think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well and
A :  Uh-huh . Okay , yep , right .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers you actually have to screw them on and stuff and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . This is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself and it'll be fine .
A :  Okay .
C :  just kinda stretch it over
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay , good yeah .
C :  and it'll just stay on and then the buttons come through and so and then the each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the R_R_ .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yep , right .
B :  Li that'll be the covers as well , yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah , yeah . I mean tha it's it's a detailed point , I just wondered I mean h how will people put these down I wonder ? Right .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Like that .
A :  Okay for some strange re reason I had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically but uh uh
B :  Yeah it could stand , yeah . Well we could broaden the broaden it out a bit so it would stand like that .
C :  Oh .
A :  Yeah , uh no because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item uh I mean it it's uh it it's just I mean it's just a minor detailed point , but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger and uh
B :  Yeah , standing .
B :  Yeah , we could just widen it out uh
A :  Yeah and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all it gives gives people the option and if if say if they've got them um because actually have several upon the uh
B :  Mm . Mm .
D :  Could have one for your stereo , one for your D_V_ player .
B :  Mm , yeah , yeah . Have to if we just lengthen it I guess so it comes down to the base of the hand and then flatten it out and could sit there .
A :  Yeah , well .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , just kind of
A :  Yeah but that that's uh but uh no the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh yeah yeah , no no , I mean that's these uh
C :  Or just make it little .
B :  Yeah , mm . Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Somewhere like that
C :  so it just sort of
B :  We might have to lengthen it so it kinda your hand still holds it and have it there , yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that . Yeah .
D :  Yeah I kinda had a
D :  a kinda a natural kind of a idea where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , yeah , kinda like that kinda like a flower or a plant for the more natural kinda
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the
B :  Mm .
C :  .
B :  The final product would actually stand up , yeah .
A :  Yeah , yeah , yeah , I mean it it's uh wouldn't wouldn't do that , indeed yeah . But th th but th yeah th b the these were all minor minor uh minor details , I think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on and the i it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different . Um , so good that's that that's excellent . Um right let us um
C :  fall over .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  .
B :  Yeah .
C :  'S a little longer .
B :  Wee
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  What's on the next one ? Oh right yes , let's have a look at the um
A :  f finance . Um , now
A :  we're given a a clear design brief , uh
A :  if I get the uh spreadsheet up .
A :  Oh .
D :  Uh yeah , just click there .
A :  .
D :  Uh the
D :  the maximise button .
A :  Oh right . Ah .
A :  Good , this is why we need to make these things simple so that the uh the the the boss can understand . Now I've um this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design and I I I've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , um I wouldn't know for in for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , that's a that's a standard colour . Uh , so we're just simply on batteries , the the one th the one decision I've had to make is that um
A :  we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with and I I um I'm I'm I'm certain that they they are around so , um that I don't think is a a serious problem . The uh the the voice sensor is is expensive but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design so that that has to stay . Um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um
A :  l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . Um it's simply made of plastic so th that's uh that's no problem and uh um just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . Um and uh
A :  we haven't actually got a scroll wheel we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um
A :  slider so um and the and the the buttons are uh uh well I do don't know that they're special colour . Anyway the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five uh but I thi I think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the
A :  uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers so uh um you know the if if if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , so uh we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward and uh uh I I think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . Um .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  Okay , uh .
A :  So um .
A :  Does anybody want to uh uh Andrew do you want what do you want to say about um
A :  the uh yeah the evaluation where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ?
D :  Evaluation .
D :  The the product or the project ?
A :  The the the well the I meant the product .
D :  Um , well well my presentation just now ? Sure , uh can I get the
A :  Yeah . Oh sorry yeah um , mm .
D :  Cheers .
A :  Mm .
A :  More loud clicks in the microphone .
D :  There we go , oh .
D :  Method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to
D :  set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . So
D :  what I've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard
D :  um gauge
D :  our team response to these questions . So , on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false .
A :  Seven being a nice round number to work to .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And then at the end just take an average
A :  On for true and seven for flase .
D :  Yes .
A :  Yes .
D :  So uh .
D :  So , look at these questions . Is the device f flashy and fashionable ?
A :  Well I think most definitely .
B :  Yeah I'd say definitely a one yeah .
C :  I think it is yeah .
D :  So uh and also uh technologically innovative ?
A :  Yes the voice technology indeed .
B :  Yeah , defi yeah , yeah
C :  Yeah .
D :  Easy to use ?
A :  I don't see we could've made it any easier .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh suitable for the consumer ? That was um
A :  Totally .
B :  Yeah definitely .
C :  Yeah I think it made we met all of the consumer
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  wants .
D :  Uh is it complicated ?
A :  No .
C :  No .
D :  Doing pretty well so far aren't we ? Uh functional ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah definitely .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um .
D :  Where are we ?
A :  found easily . yeah I mean that's that's
D :  We've b built in the the speech , where are you , function .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  Does it take long to learn to use ? Shouldn't .
B :  No , not at all .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And uh , what else ? The R_S_I_ compares to the current standards , well .
A :  Less buttons so it must be .
B :  Uh
D :  We we uh yeah it was our it was a we made an actual effort to
B :  Yeah it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well .
C :  Yeah .
B :  yeah .
A :  So yeah , um um .
D :  Um will device appeal to all age groups ?
A :  I think it will because I mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so
B :  Mm .
C :  I think so .
D :  Yeah , uh that's a good call , yeah . Well we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  And it's it's it's well I don't think we're actually
A :  charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so
B :  I I I think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , but um I think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  It will appeal f for dif for different reasons but it's it's uh yeah yeah so I I yeah I
C :  Yeah I think just the simplicity of it and
B :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  not having to learn to programme and not having you know a million buttons .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , so I think we can reasonably say it's another another one , why not ?
B :  Mm .
D :  Uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ? Uh , yeah and what h did we make the management's
A :  in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement is t it's television only , it's it's simple to use , um it's it's it's within budget , um I it's uh yes an an any minor points we we we argue .
B :  Yep .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Under the cost .
B :  Mm-hmm . Yep .
D :  Um .
A :  So uh I I think we've done an amazing job in uh
B :  Yep .
D :  Okay .
B :  Well done us .
A :  coming up with what
D :  So uh one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . Eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one .
C :  Yeah , .
A :  Need a need a calculator for that .
D :  And that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product .
B :  Excellent .
A :  Okay , nick the cable back then . Ooh . Right do um
C :  I mixed up the colours a little bit .
B :  Oh no that's
C :  I think I all wrong .
A :  either of you want to uh say anything ?
B :  Uh .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
A :  Before I uh
C :  Ps I don't think so , I mean I think we worked well together and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make and you know , seemed to discuss things pretty well and come to group consensus and
A :  No .
B :  .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well that's right , I mean th this this slide here I mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity , I mean I think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows . Um I won't comment on leadership , uh teamwork I think we've uh I think everybody's uh worked pretty well together . Um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , uh I think the results speak for itself and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , I think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh
B :  Mm . Yeah , definitely .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
A :  uh a new approach . Um are the costs within budget ? Yes . Is the project evaluated ? We're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um
B :  Yep .
A :  Thank you very much indeed , I think that I think that's uh I think we can go f for an early bath . So I call the meeting closed .
B :  Cool , thank you ,
C :  Alright .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there .
A :  Um almost , there's one more thing I have to get out of the I have to make sure that this attachment will open .
B :  I keep forgetting whether I've done this . .
A :  Ah-ha .
A :  Okay .
A :  We'll open that when the time is right .
A :  In the meantime
A :  Closing things down , okay .
A :  Let's see what this thing does .
A :  Does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? Ah , we came up together , we're good .
A :  Okay .
A :  Are we ready to start ?
A :  Okay . It's now quarter of four . This is a f another forty minute one so it will end at four twenty five .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right . Our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , for us to go over the previous minutes , then for the two of you to present your prototype and for you to g um Sarah present the evaluation criteria . We then have a finance aspect , which is a spreadsheet , an Excel spreadsheet . And I know what you're all thinking of , oh my , um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . So we're going to make a very fast track . Okay .
A :  Um and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . So the first thing I have to do is close this so that I can get to
A :  Where is it ?
D :  Red .
A :  I need to open mine .
A :  Not the agenda .
D :  Agenda three .
A :  No that th I want the minutes from the previous minutes . That should be there , minutes . Yeah . Okay . Uh from meeting three , is it alright with you if I don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? 'Cause this way I can more easily flip it . Okay , um obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , we reviewed the previous minutes before that , um each of you made your presentations .
D :  Mm .
A :  Um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . The market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . Um we decided chip on print would be used . Um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , I think was the consensus , powered by kinetic energy . There was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . Um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . Um looking like a scroll , but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling
A :  um that was actually in use , that is uh behind the scenes is push button which we uh according to Kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . Um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product that could be suggested to management . Um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us .
A :  Um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints and we ran out of time . Um we had to follow that up and prepare for the last one . And uh we closed as it ran out of time . Is that a fair presentation of what happened ? Okay , back to this meeting . Um we're down to the prototype presentation .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yep .
B :  Ta-da . Right .
C :  Alright .
A :  Over to you .
C :  Well .
A :  Ooh , two .
C :  Yeah , well you see , each made one , we didn't have enough yellow dough . This is the one
A :  Ah .
C :  that I made .
A :  Uh-huh .
C :  It is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . This is
C :  like a scroll , but they are push buttons and they enter takes you into the different menus . Of course we need someone who's experienced with the television . I mean this is the infrared thing that's gonna zap at the television . Uh I'm not quite sure how to make that , but I'm sure it will work . Uh this is on off switch , 'cause I think we do need that , and I think it gives it a nice balance . And it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . Um as for what it's actually made of well the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  Uh position , I presume that just means
C :  right right on it , easy to see . The main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , lack of uh buttons all over the place . Right ? Form
C :  curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , makes it feel nice to hold .
C :  Uh material , I think Kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , but I think we have two different options , because we did make a another one , which wa uh is in the shape of banana , it's just if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , which is also nice and easy to hold and feels good and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , just a slightly different design . Also with on off switch and infrared uh I had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So like uh well , I dunno , what's it like ? I guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth .
C :  Whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one or mix and match , just we were gonna see what you thought , the uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons .
C :  So we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . And what we
C :  well , what conclusion we reach when we discuss it .
C :  Uh material yeah , that's what I have to say about material . Can I scroll down on there and see what else
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well colour , I think I definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , because that's the company colours , but if anybody's got any other suggestions , I'm quite willing to consider them as well .
C :  So , it just depends what you think about these ideas and if I'm yeah , maybe , Kate , you better say what you think about them .
B :  Um well I don't have very much to add . Um the the case oops , that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . The the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . We're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , but it can be either of those . We have the technology to do that . Um and as for the the actual components um , uh Steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . We have simple rubber push buttons um which provide all the functionality we need . Um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , it's the stalk of the banana , or it's just the thing at the end of this version . Um so that's for material . Colour , well uh Steph's the expert on colour . Um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that .
B :  Yeah , I think that's all we've got to say really .
C :  I thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , I guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . This one has n banana , yeah . This one has no obvious connections to fruit , but because it's round and molded ,
B :  A banana .
C :  it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , it's more like yeah , you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , which I quite like that sort of image . 'Cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly and
B :  Would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ?
C :  Hold them , you see , you know . Curvature , is it to your liking ?
A :  Oh I see , the on-off's in the back .
B :  Yes , that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it .
C :  If you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all .
A :  And then you can use your thumb .
B :  And it was partly we thought the design looked better , but it could be moved if if marketing feel it's important to have the on off button in a different place .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the
C :  Breaking , oh right . Well you see , that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , because then it'd just be rigid .
A :  you know yeah .
D :  I like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role .
A :  Hmm .
D :  It's really kind of a
C :  Yeah , we really like we really like that design , I mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . Like a c like a compass point , you know , just up , down , left and right , and we think we could make that quite a good feature . And it's like the the iPod scroll wheel , but better . Yeah . Yeah , yeah , I mean it that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , I was try I was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? It's texting .
D :  Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah . But it's also like texting , you don't
B :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  And it's a very simple design , there's not a lot to wrong , the components are cheap to make .
D :  It's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different . You know , I I d I have several four remotes , and they all look the same until you get up close and you have to you know , this is really identifiable .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of I mean actually how to program the menus and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , but we do definitely think that it's a viable option .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . The next item is evaluation .
D :  No , okay .
A :  Uh if that's if you're finished .
D :  Um
C :  Uh yeah , we're finished .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  shall I take your uh power ?
A :  Oh sorry .
D :  Oh .
A :  Try again .
D :  Okay . This is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . So , this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers
D :  a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . So I'm going to go and use the whiteboard , and I've made a list of criteria to look at , and so I'm gonna I'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , so one true seven false and I'm gonna now use the um the board .
D :  Okay . So um
D :  fancy ,
D :  technologically innovative ,
D :  easy to use , trendy ,
D :  buttons ,
D :  excess buttons , good buttons ,
D :  ugly ,
D :  sellable ,
D :  and other . And in fact I hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , because these are things that um have been brought up , some of them seem rather close , like they overlap .
C :  Yeah , what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? Price of materials .
D :  Mm , yeah , price .
A :  Hmm .
D :  We'll put price up at the top .
C :  Not that we actually know anything about it , but we can we can pretend .
A :  Well we will soon , unfortunately .
D :  Okay , so
A :  Come on .
D :  Did you say ? Uh okay , so
A :  No , .
D :  wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ?
C :  It depends what what you mean by fancy really , 'cause when I think of fancy , I think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like
C :  baroque curliness and which
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I'd call these quite uh minimalist ,
B :  Yes , a plain , simple , clean design .
C :  simple and plain , but I mean I do see what it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , so in that respect it is quite fancy .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I yeah , so in that respect I think we'll go with that respect .
C :  I think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , I'd say maybe aesthetic .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Well we have got s trendy further down , but
A :  Elegant .
A :  Elegant .
D :  Elegant .
B :  Elegant , I don't know if I'd call them elegant .
D :  Yeah , no these aren't the exact terms that the um
C :  like stylish or aesthetic .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Stylish , yeah .
D :  Elegant . We're gon let's use elegant , although the the the people , the word on the street is is
C :  Fancy .
D :  Yeah . N that um
C :  Did you just break the pen ?
D :  yeah uh the uh is fancy . So let's let's take it to the next level .
C :  Well d we'll just call it fancy then .
D :  Well okay , so in terms of elegant , fancy .
D :  we'll call it E_F_ um , do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ? Should we go with the yellow in terms of I think that's a really superior they're both
C :  Yeah , I think we n we need to they're both yellow with black buttons , it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . So what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two that isn't that is more curved , like a banana , but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , so .
D :  Yeah .
D :  As a banana .
D :  I think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And of the two I really like I m I like the banana , but I I do like the chunk .
A :  The chunk .
C :  So that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , is it . Just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two .
D :  No , but I mean in terms we have to evaluate one of them .
D :  Unless do you guys wanna evaluate both ?
A :  I think between the two , somewhere between the two is true .
B :  Yeah , I'd
A :  It's more true than false , about a two .
D :  Okay .
D :  So we say true . Um
D :  technologically innovative .
B :  I d I don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . I think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative .
D :  Yeah . So we'll say we'll say uh false .
D :  Easy to use .
B :  Very .
C :  Yes .
D :  One , is that inappropriate ? Okay . Oh , pardon me . Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Trendy .
C :  Oh yes .
D :  trendy , s and I say specifically spongy fruity .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well , maybe only a two or a three then , 'cause it's no we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific
B :  We have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . I think yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah , I don't really think that's gonna work , but
D :  Okay , so two ? Um
B :  Yeah .
A :  Excess buttons . No .
D :  are there excess buttons ?
B :  No .
C :  No .
D :  That is false . Um good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons .
B :  So that's false .
A :  Better , more intuitive buttons , yes .
D :  True .
D :  Ugly .
C :  No .
B :  No .
A :  No .
D :  People don't respond well to ugly . Sellable , uh quirky , you know , something people like oh , yeah . Yeah , I do too .
B :  Yeah , I think they're different , aren't they ?
C :  Well it is quite it is quite quirky I think .
A :  I like it .
C :  It could be quite a good brand , like
D :  Oh yeah .
C :  a good little object .
D :  And I was I was thinking of other things um in terms of uh could we say it's cost saving ?
D :  With the
C :  Oh , we also need tho think about the energy . Is it the kinetic energy ? If it's it is gonna be environmentally friendly with the kinetic energy .
D :  Yeah , with the energy .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
D :  It is going to be kinetic ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , we'll c we'll say it's a cost saving enviro .
D :  Uh so yes .
C :  Yeah , but we haven't
C :  completely developed that side of it yet , so we're not completely sure about that , but yeah .
D :  Well you're still in the Play-Doh stage . Anything else ? Including price , do you have any idea about price or other features ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well I think our instinct is that it should be pretty cheap to develop . We haven't got a lot of expensive components in there .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yes , the instinct says true .
D :  So true one or should I go to two or three ?
B :  I'd put it at one I think , but I dunno , what do you
D :  Okay .
C :  I would say maybe a two , 'cause we still we need to uh get somebody in who is good with the programming for the menus
C :  and things . I mean it's not just like I mean it's not like ev you know , on a normal chunky remote every button res I mean means something different , whereas this one has only got the four buttons and they all they mean everything , depending on what menu you're in . uh we need somebody to develop that .
B :  Yeah , true , it might be the yeah , yeah , true .
A :  Yeah , that's not a cheap thing to get .
B :  True .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah , that's a good point .
D :  other ? Anything else you guys can thing of ?
D :  And I'm gonna actually change a couple of these so then I'm gonna instead of ugly I'm gonna say it's attractive and then make that true , so that 'cause I have to do an average . And then um excess buttons .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
C :  Just putting no excess buttons .
D :  Exactly .
D :  Wow we're doing really well .
D :  Yeah , be you know , so it doesn't ruin the polarity .
C :  As for see if we're technologically innovative , I'd say it is quite innovative , because there aren't really many that have this menu idea instead of all the extra buttons . I mean I know we're not doing anything involving internet or speech recognition
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  but but we are at the upper end of the push button market .
D :  Or L_C_D_ .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well if you g uh let me know if if any of these um if you if you all can think of any other um thing to change here if you th if you think I should change the innovative or add other features . If not I'll average those .
A :  I think we're good .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
A :  Okay . We're a little over halfway through the meeting and the next big thing is the finance .
D :  So
A :  Okay .
D :  Um okay , how about if I uh pass this back to you and I'll uh figure out the average here .
A :  Yep .
A :  Right .
D :  Thank you for everyone's help with that .
A :  Right .
A :  And as you can see it says the same thing , it had not lost itself , thank Goodness . And we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet that they provided to me . Um
A :  it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device .
A :  Hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells .
A :  Okay .
C :  Well , just kinetic then , .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  what's a hand dynamo ?
C :  It's the wind-up .
B :  That was the crank , wind-up crank on the side .
A :  Oh shoot , forget that . Kinetic is um and how many of those will we need per we only need one .
B :  Just one .
A :  Okay . Electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those .
B :  Uh uh yeah , I think we can do it all with simple
B :  Just checking that .
B :  Yeah , simple , 'cause we've just got push buttons , so we can do it all with simple which is the ch should be the cheapest .
A :  Okay , and we only need one of those . Okay , the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . It looks like it single curve , 'cause of th the chunkiness . It's that's uh uh one .
B :  Yep .
B :  Yeah , that that one is single curve , isn't it ? Um do we have
C :  What does double curved mean , I don't understand .
A :  And that's
B :  I I think you it means you reverse the curve .
A :  uh that's the the one that goes like this .
C :  Oh no , we don't need that . No .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , I do I don't think we need that for either of them , you can do a banana in single curve , yeah .
A :  Right .
C :  Single-curved , I'd say .
A :  No , single curve .
A :  Okay , case material supplements . Plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . We had the special colour .
C :  I just wanna say plastic .
A :  And did we say plastic ?
B :  Yeah , can we do some what ifs , 'cause it may I mean I I still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , but it depends on the cost , I guess .
D :  One , two , three , four , five , six .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . We'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added at the moment , that's where we are . Interface button push button interface . That's what we're using , isn't it ?
C :  It's just button .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep . Do we need to say how many buttons , or
A :  Whoops , don't want that , not yet . Um
B :  or d is it just one ?
A :  No , it just says push button interface . Button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black .
B :  'Kay .
A :  And the buttons
A :  Wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ?
B :  Uh they'll be rubber , yep .
A :  So we need one of them .
A :  And are they any special form ?
C :  Well yeah , like the compass point one .
B :  Actually , does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? 'Cause I think they can be plastic .
A :  'Cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top .
B :  Yeah . They could be plastic , we don't have to have rubber buttons , because we haven't got a double curved case .
A :  Oh .
C :  Yeah , they could be plastic .
A :  Okay .
A :  let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement .
B :  It's just one , isn't it ?
A :  Uh we only need one of them .
A :  Um and the total cost has been calculated as nine Pounds twenty out of the twelve and a half we were allowed .
B :  What , we're in .
D :  Yeah .
A :  We're in . That's us .
B :  More profit .
C :  Great .
A :  Okay , I'm going to save this into our
A :  desktop , project documents . Okay .
A :  As our project document bit .
B :  Do you do you need to double click on that to open it ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  There we are .
A :  That's the only Excel document that will be in there , so it's there for all of us . Okay , so , are they under twelve fifty ? Yes , go to the project evaluation , next slide . Right . Um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity .
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , leadership ,
C :  Yeah .
D :  Sure .
A :  teamwork ,
D :  Yes .
A :  means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things .
C :  And Play-Doh .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , the Play-Doh was best , I thought .
C :  Yeah well , 'cause I mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . So much better just to go and ,
C :  you know , this is it , this is what we want .
B :  Yep .
A :  Okay .
A :  So , we went over all those things and we're satisfied with all the above .
D :  Yep .
A :  Um did we find any new ideas ?
D :  I think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped I I mean I that really opened my eyes .
C :  Yeah . Spongy .
D :  I I only speak for myself though .
C :  And I'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , so . Good work as a design team , because we
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I think we're a good team actually .
B :  I'm not sure all the wires are really great though .
A :  So we actually worked well as a group .
B :  I thought so .
A :  Right . Are the costs within the budget ? Yes . Is the project evaluated ? Yes .
C :  Oh yes .
D :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yes .
D :  I can give you a number , um it's uh the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , so it means w you know , I can I can spell it out . There were six true or ones , four um pardon me , two s almost true or close to true , so that was four points , and then uh one false , seven points , so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two . I would say that's ex excellent
B :  Yes . Oh hang on , we haven't heard .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place .
C :  Yeah . And the the only false one is because we've chosen
D :  To maintain old technology , exactly .
C :  to keep a simple old technology , which if it works perfectly well I see no point in improving on if it works , so .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Absolutely , and it's kept us within budget .
D :  Yes .
C :  Yeah . So we do count as I think excellent or one .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright . And we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , I have a final report to present , um and then we're done .
C :  .
D :  Okay .
C :  Bring on the ice sculptures .
A :  We done good , and we're finished in time .
D :  Nice .
B :  And then we get the product launch party . Product launch party ? Absolutely .
D :  So we might have to wait .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That's what I said , ice sculptures .
D :  Um I one thing I want to do is oh , I think the meeting's done .
C :  Is that the end of the meeting ?
A :  I believe that is the end of our meeting . Thank you , Melissa .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Um one thing I wa I wanna do is save everything in the right files , because I don't think everything is saved .
D :  The right files . Final meeting market
A :  So is Why not save that .
D :  No , you'll ha have to open it up from elsewhere .
A :  Do you want to replace existing file , no .
A :  I actually tried to transfer it to My Documents , but
D :  Yeah , you have to you have to close that window . 'Cause that's the save one isn't it , so
D :  And then find it .
A :  spreadsheet .
A :  Yeah , but I've ta uh right , I'll just re-do it . That's the easiest way .
A :  Right .
C :  Well we've made our prototype anyway .
C :  We can have a good look at that .
D :  You pass it round to have a look .
C :  Mm-hmm . Y no , it's a slightly curved around the sides .
D :  Mm very nice .
C :  Um , it's almost curved like up to the main display as well . And the little line at the bottom indicates the bit the panel that you pull down . And the extra function buttons are below that panel on the little line . And we've got the stick on the button with the company logo on .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We also have a apple slash cherry design at the top .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So it is , yeah . Cherry would be alright actually . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's a bit more fun , isn't it ? And it's kinda not really at a kind of you think apple , you think computers , like Apple Mac .
B :  Yeah , yeah , we might get a
D :  Mm-hmm . Copyright , yeah . What's this this one ? What's that one there ?
C :  Yeah , and cherries are fun , summery . Ah , that's the mute .
D :  Oh , okay . Right .
B :  For the M_ .
C :  It it'd probably have to be labelled mute . But um , we didn't have anything small enough to write .
D :  Uh-huh .
B :  They're thinking
D :  Okay .
B :  For the first time , well it was hard to get the h um the actual labelling on the individual buttons .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , we just chose simple shapes for all them . Um , the important ones are the volume ones . So we made them a bit bigger . The mute could possibly be a bit smaller .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Hum , you separate off in colour the volume related buttons from the channel related buttons , so you've got the volume in orange on design there , and the the channel is in blue .
C : 
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  R right . Um , all these things have cost implications . And so when I done my thing on cost a I had assumed that the only uh button that would be a different colour would be the uh the red apple button .
C :  Yeah , and we chose a V_ plus and V_ minus .
A :  So However , I've now . But um , yeah so uh but there would be a cost implication on that , and uh as I suppose that so whether wanted to put in all these colours , would be uh open to debate , I suppose .
D :  I'll see if I can find them .
B :  Yeah , sis
C :  Well the colours wouldn't like that's they wouldn't be too important , but we didn't have any white Play-Doh . So that's where the colour buttons came from .
D :  Have
A :  An important consideration . Right , okay so um
A :  And the second one underneath would be the idea for the
B :  Yes , we'll have the slide-away .
A :  Right , okay . So we've got um detail design meeting .
B :  Bottom .
A :  Right .
A :  So So , we've got
A :  prototype presentation , which we've just done , evaluation criteria , um and finance , so I guess w we have to evaluate if that meets the various uh aspects that we're looking for uh from um our previous meeting . So other than the fact that it doesn't have the second layer , but um obviously obviously it would . But other than that , we got the red apple . We got the buttons and the only thing that has really changed is the is the colouration of the buttons , and the bit after the evaluation criteria is uh is the finance . And the and the cost implication . The only snag about this is that uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , yes .
D :  Right .
B :  Okay .
A :  the cost is probably kind of important . So um , and then the production evaluation , as to how easy that would be to uh to manufacture . Um ,
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  and whether it would uh
D :  So if you had to do a presentation or will you just work it on the prototype ?
C :  Uh , that's it .
B :  This this is a yes , this is our presentation of the prototype .
D :  That's the pr
A :  Right , so uh as far as the the finance of it would be concern would be to make sure that the cost aye the production cost 'cause you may remember that was one of the first uh considerations was to be in d under um uh twelve fifty or two and a half uh twelve and a half Euros .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So , there's no redesign . So that should uh Right , so , seems to me that the thing that I have to do is
A :  is quickly find that uh
B :  Could we get this on the board just so we can see or do you mean do you have the figures there ?
D :  we should plug it in . Do you wanna plu do you wanna plug it in into the the back of that one .
A :  Right .
A :  Okay .
B :  'Kay , Alice .
B :  So , sh
D :  We could do it as we d go along , the production costs , looking at the prototype .
A :  Right . .
B :  'Kay this should be then .
A :  Okay , so , by the fact that we've got uh the simple chip and the uh kinetic energy source , we've got a single curved
A :  case . We've got a rubber uh case materials supplements . So , we had decided that we're having rubber buttons and
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Have a push button interface .
A :  Okay . W the button supplements . Well , originally , I thought there would just be uh one in there because it was the one red apple . But So the so the real w the real question then would come in . Do you make all the buttons
B :  Um
B :  Um
D :  Well do we'll do it on the prototype , so do two , see how much it is .
A :  Well , so we've got one special button form , which was the apple . Everything else is gonna be a standard . We've got special material , rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera and that , so , I was originally , I was thinking rubber wasn't special , but according to this , maybe it is . So
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  And then we'd have
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And the r I mean effectively we've got sixteen buttons that we're gonna have on there .
D :  Yeah . I think you just do one , don't you , for the
A :  W I don't know is is is the sort of answer , is that meant to be all sixteen buttons , and therefore I mean , what's the op The option was maybe not to have rubber buttons , but just to have the one that was soft and spongy , and therefore
D :  I think I think it's just it's just a one . Else
A :  Whereas it would be the special colour would be for the So you would only have the one special button that was rubber , whereas the rest would be hard plastic .
D :  I thi I think I think the button supplement i is just a supplement for all the buttons made in a different material , rather than per button .
A :  Mm . I would Every design change is uh I dunno , um Okay , um ,
D :  I don't know though .
D :  Hmm .
A :  if we just had all the buttons as standard , except for the one red apple , then that would take care of that , I guess . We'd have one special colour and one special button form .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And when
A :  I plugged that in last time remember it has to be under twelve and a half .
A :  As far as I know , that um that took care of the uh of the various supplements . And if What happened ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  You've just gone off the window into another one . It's on the bottom row .
C :  Maybe if you just minimise that one in the top right-hand corner of the little box . Yeah .
A :  Now , right . Okay , so , but the point would be that if we uh
A :  if we just did special Sorry , you were saying that it would be that one , that you would put in one there .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  So that's nine point one there so we've got some
A :  So it Well , is it s is no , it's nine point seven I've got . Okay .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Just give us a bit of
A :  So , that would
A :  that would work out fine if uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  uh as assuming your correction are are assuming that that one change covers all the buttons , then that would be fine . And there's nothing else as far as I can see that we we had uh planned to put on .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I switching around those th um on the electronics we got the sample sensor . At the moment we've just got the simple chip , which costs one . Um , I guess the sample sens sample speaker would be the voice recognition thing , which puts up to four ? We should be slightly over our budget but if we gather something else down to slightly lower standard , and maybe go with the one the special form buttons , then we could have the speech
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , hold on . Um , if we
A :  Okay , that gives us twelve point seven
B :  So uh maybe if we got rid of like the maybe one of the special colours , kept them all the same colour , then we could have the voice recognition without
A :  But remember that the idea was to keep it the colour of the Oh , I see , so just take out the special colour for the apple and
B :  Yeah , yeah . Um
C :  Um , . D wouldn't you have to keep the simple chip there as well ? You know how you turn that one to a zero , wouldn't the chip and the sample speaker be separate things , so you need both of them ?
D :  Yeah , we have to have it
B :  Oh possibly , yeah , yeah maybe . Maybe um we'd be giving up on the kinetic .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um
A :  And go for battery instead . That would give you one less .
D :  Yeah .
B :  We should Yeah , that would save us one , though we'd still be slightly ov
A :  But you reckon that i I mean the thing is that you wanted to a appeal to people and not have to replace batteries .
B :  Yeah , yeah . Well , since it's the through the whole technology type thing , um , you were saying in the market research that people like kind of interesting gadgets in them . Um , whether they would figure the the s uh sample senor and the sample speaker , voice recognition be sort of a worthwhile thing to have . And then still have the batteries , or whatever they would prefer not uh You know what I mean ? The the problem was the battery's running out and losing the um losing the remote . So you gotta decide which of those is more important to them .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  But which do you think or which do we think is the more important of the options ? In a sense , at the moment , we've got a total which we need to reduce down by one point two . At least . Remember that was a minimum requirement . The other option if we're planning on just going for something cheap and cheerful , would be to um make it originally , we're gonna make it a simple product .
C :  I think the voice recognition .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Shall we shall we evaluate the prototype as we've got it now first , and then sort of make decisions about what needs to be changed after ? Okay . Right um , I have a little thing . So , we've all got a note of it's thirteen point seven , isn't it , with everything we want on .
A :  Mm-hmm . Makes sense .
B :  Okay .
A :  .
A :  Sorry , do you want that back up ?
D :  Yeah , I just had a presentation to
A :  Right .
D :  do .
C :  But I do think uh the v uh voice recognition thing would be more impressive than the fact that it's got no battery .
A :  Okay , but remember the main the only reason we were planning on having the voice recognition was so that they could find the remote if it got lost .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm . Right okay um ,
D :  This is about the evaluation criteria that we use for the the prototype we've got here . And so the method is that the design team makes a prototype , and we evaluate the prototype against some criteria that we've formulated . And those ones are gonna be in response to sort of market research , and also finance , I guess .
D :  And do that on a scale from say true being one and false being seven , so if it's neither true nor false , then that's four .
D :  So , I got a set of criteria just based on the marketing that we need to add in a financial one as well , at the end . Um so ,
D :  We have to say whether it's true or false that the product looks and feels fancy .
D :  Um
D :  The whether the product demonstrates technical innovation . Whether it's easy to use .
D :  Whether it's incorporating sort of the fashion element to attract the buyer . And whether it's a sort of recognisable Real Reaction product . And I have to go up onto the whiteboard and do this apparently , so I'll go over here .
B :  Okay .
D :  Right . So the first one is um , does the product look and feel fancy . So if we do a sort of a one
D :  So
B :  Okay , well we have a single curve , which was maybe like the feel of the product's quite good . So uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Um , then we have the rubber kinda spongy feel , which was in at the time .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Um , sorry that'd be considered fancy .
C :  Yeah , I'd maybe give it a
C :  a two .
D :  Of but I think What Is one false , or is t one true ? I forgot . One's true , and okay . Seven's fal Four is neutral , okay . So
C :  One's true .
C :  And a four is neutral .
B :  So maybe maybe a two .
C :  Yeah , 'cause we haven't got the double curve , so we can't like say it's completely true . But it's pretty close . We've got almost everything we can .
A :  Go for one . Yep .
D :  Right .
D :  Okay . Right . I gonna put underneath so I've got some more space .
A :  Okay .
D :  So , false is seven , true is one , and
D :  So uh say about a two for fancy , you think ? Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , why not not , m m maybe nearer three .
D :  Okay , well d you do an average at the end , I don't know . Um
A :  Two three . Well , it's just that uh saying something remember that when you look down , we've got solar power , we've got uh various other things you could have , and we're not going for these options .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  This this is just this is just for like the look . Does it sort of look fancy rather than functional . So
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , I suppose that might be in the technical innovation bit .
D :  Yeah , so that so sh should we go for a a two on that ?
A :  Okay .
D :  'Kay . And I mean , how much does the product demonstrate technical innovation do you reckon ?
B :  Um , deciding between the kinetic power or um the speech recognition , and if we had either of those for our budget , they both show a reasonable amount of speech recognition .
D :  D yeah .
D :  Okay . So , what about the pr The prototype as it is , we've got we've got the speech recognition on it , haven't we .
B :  Um
B :  But not the kinetic .
D :  But not the kinetic .
B :  Like the power .
A :  No . 'Cause you can't afford that w we took that out too .
B :  No , we c ca yeah , we can't afford both .
D :  Alright , so
A :  Didn't you ? Or
D :  So it doesn't It's pretty The prototype as it is isn't sort of um fulfilling the
B :  No may is maybe about neutral plus it it it's got something , but it hasn't got
C :  Maybe a three .
D :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  Well , wait a minute . In thirteen point seven we do have kinetic . The problem is we have to reduce down from there to get it down to twelve point five . And one way of doing that would be to take out the kinetic . So , it's very much dependant on what you do with your options .
C :  I would give it more than a four .
B :  Right .
B :  Okay .
D :  Right , okay .
A :  And if you're definitely going for the sample sensor and sample speaker , then because that the other functions we've got in are are more at the The special material , the rubber , wood , titanium , et cetera ,
B :  'Kay .
A :  if you go for that , th that's at the high end 'cause that's point six , whereas down at uh just special colours uh is point two . Now you're trying to lose one point two , so it seems to me that if you're going for the sample sensors speaker , you're basically then having to go for the cheaper options on everything else .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  And and the simple way to do it would be to have a battery , to have your uh sample sensor speaker , and then you're looking to uh take out uh point two , which would be come from the button supplements category .
B :  Um
D :  I'm just gonna check my email .
D :  I'm just gonna check exactly what it said in the email for um
D :  the product .
C :  How much of a difference would it make if we made the case in plastic ?
C :  Because we did say that we don't wanna follow the fashion too much . If the buttons are rubber that might be spongy enough . And then it stand the test of time better .
A :  Um , interface type um , well plastic rather than rubber . That that that would make the significant difference . You could either you could have it If you have a in plastic rather than rubber , then that would uh enable you to get you could keep kinetic then , you could keep your sample sensor , and you'd be looking to take out point two . So you could uh fiddle that down your special form at the bottom , or your special colour at the bottom . And that would enable you to to do it .
D :  Okay . But I
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
B :  So it says if we make a slightly more fancy , then we lose points innovation , and if we make it more innovative innovative , then we lose points on it being fancy , so
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  , I just read the email again and it sort of says it's evaluate the design sort of as it is , I think , so I think we need to think about finance after we've sort of evaluated that design . I don't know whether we're doing it in the wrong order or something or .
A :  Well , okay , but
C :  Well , I suppose it's rubber as it is , isn't it .
A :  It's rubber as it is , yes .
D :  So , I mean does this need to go up a bit or something , 'cause we've got both the
D :  both the um
A :  We got we've we've got thirteen point seven and we've got it in at the moment and if and basically , we're going to reduce down from that . But the current one , you'd say would be fancy , would be too
D :  the speech
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah . Um , for for innovation , so we've got the speech the speech thing , and
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I would've said about a two as well .
D :  Do you reckon a two ?
C :  Yeah , two or three . I'd be happy with a two .
D :  Okay . Two . And the next one is I'll have to get it back up now .
A :  Oh .
A :  The next on Well , I can just sing about . Easy to use . I would've said yes . I would go for a one on that at this point in time .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , I would say so as well .
A :  Um , incorporates elements of fashion to attract buyer . Well , yeah it certainly has some .
B :  Um
C :  Yeah , it's got the cherry and the sponginess .
A :  .
B :  It does , yeah .
D :  Um
A :  Yep .
D :  Say about a three maybe ?
A :  I don't know .
B :  Yeah , m um Yeah , it was just doing it quite well . Um , I think we're gonna have to lose some of these , but the moment , as it stands , it's um
C :  Maybe two ?
A :  Yep .
A :  Yeah , I woulda said two would seem reasonable .
D :  It's a two .
A :  The product is a recognisable real
A :  r uh reaction product ?
D :  Yeah , this is
B :  Uh the sensor using all of its all of its products , all of its buttons , and it's got a fairly big label on the bottom saying
D :  This
C :  Yeah , that's a bit rough at the minute .
D :  Yeah .
B :  where it comes from .
D :  So this is about sort of the corporate image of like new sort of sleek technology and all that sort of thing , as well as having the logo on and all that . So sort of
A :  Oh .
B :  Okay .
D :  Is it sort of a recognisable product . Does it fit in with our other other products , which uh are sort of coffee makers and spacecraft .
A :  S
D :  What do y
C :  Uh , well it's got the same um speech feature as the coffee machine .
B :  Also it's kind of spongy rubberiness is maybe bit more kinda comfortable than kinda sleek and new age . Um , it depends which way you look at it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay . So we're going for a
D :  So
B :  Maybe a kind of three ? Uh d
A :  two , three ?
D :  Two or three ?
C :  Yeah , two or three . Well , the logo would be more um recognisable on the actual thing . It's just that the pen wouldn't really write on that paper . But um ,
A :  Sure .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I think the logo would definitely be recognisable . And it does have attributes that other products do . Two ? Aye . Go for it .
A :  Right , okay .
D :  Two or three .
A :  Two . Right , come on . That's that decided . Right . So
D :  How
D :  Two . Okay .
D :  Right .
A :  So we're now on to changing it to get it to fit in with the budget requirements , and then
D :  Yeah .
C :  What does what do all them numbers mean then ? Do we add them up and rate or anything ?
D :  Yeah we s yeah , I think we sort of add them up so sort of at an average is gonna be I'm just gonna do this in my head . One point eight isn't it or something . I think , anyway .
A :  About a two .
A :  Two .
D :  So yeah , pretty close to a two .
B :  Yeah , so it's
D :  So
D :  So it's I mean it's pretty good at the moment , but it's gonna get worse , isn't it . But we've gotta try and make sure it doesn't get too bad .
A :  Yep .
B :  So should we get So are definite Was it thirteen point seven was the definite price rule if has . Okay , so we need to
A :  Two b two b two , yeah .
A :  Yes .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , you can lose one point two and still meet the requirements .
D :  Do you wanna plug it into yours so we can get up the
A :  Okay , well I put it back on .
B :  So I guess this Is this the last stage once we sort out the finances part of it ?
D :  the finances
D :  I'm not sure .
C :  we'll probably have to re-rate it .
A :  Yes , I would've thought so .
B :  Yeah , yeah we'll make the adjustments and then see how are rates are going .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so what was it , control uh F_ eight , wasn't it ?
C :  Ah it's on .
D :  it's come on already .
A :  Oh . Oh . How kind . Right , okay . So , you can see there that the If you want to keep kinetic , right , you've got a choice there of going down to battery , which would save you one . You've got
A :  the sample sensor and and sample speaker , which is your big item .
B :  Oh actually we just have a plastic case , then we lose two points , which gets us um
A :  That's right .
D :  Mm .
A :  Which gets you
B :  In right within the budget range .
A :  Yes .
C :  Yeah , I think that'd be fine . Because that was just a trend , and we do have rubber buttons anyway .
B :  So that's eleven point seven , and then we could make sure we definitely had all the button supplements .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Different different colours , yeah . Yeah , I was I was thinking that because maybe maybe the sort of rubber case is a bit less in sort of the corporate identity than the sort of you know sleeker plastic case .
A :  Alright .
B :  Possibly , yeah .
B :  Um
C :  Yeah .
B :  And that would allow us to have all the technical innovations . So we'd lose a little bit on the maybe kind of
A :  Okay , so
A :  So we're going for plastic , yes ?
D :  Lose a little bit on the fashion , yeah , but
A :  Yep .
D :  And then
B :  Oh yeah , and that would now be Yeah , that's that's within the budget . Um
B :  Do we actually have Do we just have one special uh special forms down here ?
A :  Well , uh w uh there was debate as to how you would count them . You got special colour . Well originally I was assuming we had the red apple , and therefore , that was the special colour .
B :  Um
C :  Yeah , I think we should just imagine white buttons .
B :  And we we've we've got we've got enough for another we've got nought point eight left , so we've got enough for another
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , we've got special form . Now that would be one button , and the question was was that all buttons or is that just one button . 'Cause our plan really was to have one button only with a special So so no matter how you look at that , that would be the same . The other thing would then be special material , rubber , wood , titanium .
B :  Yeah , um
B :  But the but but but the
B :  I think maybe the special colour , we've got three now just because the volume buttons are different , I guess we'd have the ones which are blue at the moment would would just be the standard colour . Yeah , which I think we should Yeah , they'll still be fine for the for the price .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . So , special colour , you want three in there .
A :  Okay .
D :  Well I thin I think you you you just need two for the special colour 'cause it's just two supplements , you know . One original colour and then sort of two supplements , I think maybe .
A :  That makes sense .
B :  Okay , uh that's probably it .
D :  Okay . So we only ne we only need two for that . 'Cause I mean these these are moulded . The one colour's gonna be moulded out of a piece of plas uh of rubber , isn't it .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Yeah , I would agree with that , I think . So special colours , two .
D :  Right .
A :  And we've got special form is the one apple . The rest are all standard , although you could argue that should maybe be You were making these buttons down the bottom , I was presuming , bigger than the other ones , or were you ? Was that the idea ?
B :  Ne uh
C :  Yeah , the volume ones should stand out a bit .
B :  Maybe that'll be a second supplement . Then there's a spe a second special form .
D :  Yeah , that
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh-huh . I would have thought that's probably about r well .
B :  Um
B :  Well you got you got twelve .
D :  Okay , so tha
B :  So I think that should still be okay . Yeah , that's twelve point three , so we're still
A :  Right .
B :  within budget on that . Um
A :  Yep , that makes sense .
B :  So decide we've lost a little bit on the fashion and lost a bit on the fancy kinda side of it , but generally speaking , we've kept the other attributes to the
A :  Yep .
A :  I woulda said so . Yeah . So you'd maybe put fash fan uh fashion at three rather than two .
B :  That's without
D :  So shall we do a Well , um
B :  Yeah .
B :  And specially it definitely could fits the the real product What was the what's the company name ?
C :  Real Reactions ?
A :  Real Reaction produ I'm not quite sure , what does that mean ?
B :  R yeah . Yeah , yeah . I mean it still seems definitely fit that p so that's like if that's the new age kind of um inno innovative
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , so
B :  c type company , then um having the kinetic feature and the voice recognition is p quite high up on
D :  Uh
A :  Yep I would s
D :  So it's w if we've if we've put in for another special form on a button , then maybe they could be a different shape . Like we got a cherry one . Maybe other ones could be something else shaped . I don't know . That would be poss seeing as seeing as it's cheaper to make them a different
B :  Um
A :  You mean of
D :  seeing as we've got , you know , we've made it a a special form , so And that would sort of maybe keep us close on the sort of the fashion type one . And it would sort of , you know , keep it quite fancy as well , I don't know .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well you could argue you might do it once a year , you would change , because at the moment you're making a red apple . So next year you could make next year's model the same , but have it as a a yeah whate whatever , a lemon . Yeah , l a lemon lemon or something . And that
D :  Well you could
B :  Yeah so it's a
D :  Yeah .
B :  Whatever fruit was in fashion next year .
D :  Yeah , I mean the volume buttons could be lemons or something , maybe .
A :  amount
D :  Okay .
D :  So , we've what have we what have we rid of . We got rid of
D :  the plastic .
A :  Yeah , we've the main thing we've changed really is the casing isn't it ? We've
D :  Is it The rubber .
B :  That yeah , that was uh that was just about all . I think we've saved quite a bit because we've just got the push-button interface , which is by far the cheapest .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  So maybe in a sense not having that , maybe we've lost some maybe lost something on the innovation side ? I dunno . And that is like the most standard type of button .
D :  But uh
D :  So I mean , we've got we got rid of the rubber case , but
D :  we've now s we now sort of got an extra form , and an extra colour for the buttons . So maybe in terms of sort of fanciness and fashionability , we're pretty much the same , maybe . So , I mean we could maybe put two again on them .
B :  Yeah .
B :  And everything else has stayed pretty much the same , so
A :  Well , ease has certainly stayed .
B :  Yeah , plus if anything that is special forms makes it slightly easier to
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . And what about the sort of innovation ?
B :  to use .
D :  Do you think
B :  Um , well we've still got the kinetic energy . Um
D :  Okay .
A :  And the speech feature .
B :  Yeah , the speech feature .
D :  And then , the corporate identity .
B :  I think we've cut just about the same . We've maybe lost
B :  Hasn't it It's hard to tell how the rubber the rubber casing would really affect
A :  How it would play out , yeah . Oh .
D :  Yeah . Whether whether that's considered to be sort of
D :  part of the corporate identity , I don't know .
B :  Um
D :  I mean , it's maybe not . I mean
B :  But I think more the the features of the actual control will be more important than maybe than the the actual aesthetics , but
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But either way , I think we've made it fairly close to what
D :  Yeah . Okay , well I mean
C :  Yeah , I don't see how we could make it any more .
D :  We cou
C :  Um , apart from maybe
C :  doing the whole thing in the kinda light shade of blue , like the casing .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But then what colour would you make the R_s ?
B :  just the the company logo . So maybe there's like a set design which we get printed off .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , but you've got the company logo on there , which would effectively be a stick-on badge . So you're in a sense , you're comparing the product without the company logo . And then y but you've got the space for it to stick it on .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Hey , what what what's the company colour ? Did you get told what the company colour is or
B :  I'm still not quite sure we've established that .
C :  No , I just We got the logo off the web browser .
A :  Don't think so . But but i but in the sense that , as you saw with um the Windows logo badge , it doesn't really matter . There's virtually n The way that you frame , you know , the Windows badge on there , it really doesn't matter what colour it is , so long as our company's logo is framed w in the same way as that with a like a black outline . Fact , they've got black and white or black and silver . So basically , even if you had a silver the same colour of silver on your display , because you've got effectively a double edging on the uh on the logo , it means that it splits off what your logo is from the from the product . And that's actually quite a sneaky way of doing it .
D :  Oh right .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
D :  Uh-huh . 'Cause you've got sort of we've got point two to play with if you really wanted to .
A :  You could put in another Well , in this one , you've actually got three colours of buttons . Well , we decided that the blue ones were the um the standard colour . So you were talking about uh um We're assuming that all the buttons on the second panel , the hidden away panel , would all be standard .
D :  Another colour . Or would that be t
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  m may or may not be the case .
D :  Yeah . Shall we save the point two for profitability then ?
B :  Um
A :  Well , yeah . Bu but but uh was the was there not a button that you were thinking of on the um on the other opt you know , on the second page , as it were , that uh you were thinking of maybe having as a different colour ?
C :  Um , I don't think they would really need to be . I think if they were just all small round blue buttons , it'd be fine . Needs to be an enter button , but could just be the same as well .
B :  Yeah , maybe we've m
B :  Maybe for the the one they're gonna see all the time , we make it look good , and um , fit the kind of idea of what they want . And then for the more functional buttons , we don't worry too much about that and just have that as like a plus it's hidden away anyway , you're not gonna see it at the start .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah . I mean it's the sort of thing that , I mean , you wanna pick up the controller and just hit a button quickly to change the channel or volume . So , if it's dead obvious , then that's fine . But if you're opening the panel and you're looking and you're tuning , then you're paying a bit more attention . So it may be sort of different colour buttons isn't so important .
A :  Yeah , well
A :  Alright . Okay .
D :  'Cause you Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  So
A :  So we just add that to profitability in effect .
D :  Yeah , I mean so we've dropped the cost , but
A :  Right , so we're meant to finish up in five minutes .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Same sort of function ? The criteria ? It's alright . Just made a load of money .
B :  'Kay .
C :  Shouldn't we maybe lose a point on fashion , go to a three ? 'Cause we've lost the overall spongy feel .
C :  'Cause it doesn't seem right that it just hasn't changed at all .
D :  Well , but I think we said that w
D :  Because you got rid of the rubber , we put an extra an extra sort of fruit um shape on one of the buttons . le lemon sh
C :  Alright . Did we decide what that was , which button it was ? On the volume ones ?
D :  I think well , we could have lemon shaped ones with the volume ones or something . Or something like that . Yeah .
C :  Right .
B :  Uh , . That's good .
B :  Definitely lemon shaped .
D :  Did did you have to have a rubber case , though , for rubber buttons ? Or was it the other way around ?
B :  You had to have rubber buttons if you had the rubber case . So I think we can we're okay .
D :  Right , okay .
A :  Mm-hmm . So we're okay this way around .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So that so we've saved
A :  Until the design team comes in and says , get off . But you are the design team .
B :  Then we say it's fine , so it's all good .
D :  Saved two Euros on that .
A :  So what bit are we on to ?
C :  Um , can I just check if that's a cherry or an apple ? Did we decide against the apple because of Apple Mac ? And did we make it a cherry officially ? Right .
A :  Yeah . I th I th Oh . Right , okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Just in case we need that point two for lawsuits and such like .
A :  Oh drats , I've botched that , haven't I .
C :  So were we aiming for a certain target on that scale ?
D :  Well , we're aiming for um one for all of them .
D :  M but it really has to fit into the budget , so
C :  Right .
D :  I guess we just have to adjust things to
D :  get it i in the
D :  Which is fair enough .
B :  And we seem to have least something in each criteria .
D :  Yeah .
B :  We haven't completely left anything out , so
D :  Yeah , I think
D :  most
B :  As an overall product which has to be quite cheap , we've just about achieved
D :  Yeah .
B :  everything .
D :  Yep .
C :  So do we have anything else to discuss ?
D :  I don't know . What's on the agenda ?
A :  Right , okay um
A :  What's happened here ?
A :  Right , okay um
A :  Mm .
A :  Right , okay um , Right . So we got
B :  We've got the closing .
A :  So we've done the
A :  the finance bit and the Excel project and the We've done the redesign . So we're now on to project process .
A :  Now satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , et cetera , whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . So , we're actually now uh , in a sense , on to the evaluation of the course rather than the evaluation of the project is m my understanding of it .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  So what did you and remembering that nobody's just over the curtain . So , um
D :  Finish your meeting now .
B :  We should just go through this quickly and then
C :  Huh .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So
A :  I suppose the easiest way of doing it is to put some notes down , which I will do .
D :  Okay .
A :  So , uh I think I have to finish that page . Right , okay , so
D :  Oh .
A :  Project evaluation . So , um
A :  Creativity .
A :  Did you feel you got a chance to express yourselves well enough ? Well um
B :  Um , yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I thought some of the divisions though between sort of the individual meetings were a bit arbitrary .
A :  Individual meetings . How do you mean ?
D :  Yeah . Well , we were finding out various things in
A :  In you on your own .
D :  in be in-between the meetings , and they didn't the one meeting didn't always follow on for the other one , you know , sort of we had things thrown in at the second meeting where , you know , you'd looked at the remote controls and seen the curviness , but in the first one you'd also looked at some remote controls and looked at the buttons , and I don't understand why it would be in separate meetings that you'd do that . You know , you'd sort of you'd probably present it at one or something like that .
A :  Um
A :  Mm , The only thing you find is in a manufacturing process , you would normally , you go to a meeting , you decide , right , you do this , you do that , you do that . Then you go away . You find out information . You then come back . You then discuss it . You then go and change things around , and then go back . So
D :  Yeah .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I suppose and then be going out and finding more information each time and then diff things will be relevant .
A :  Whereas , this time , you're really getting it from a database source , so it's not uh well uh Anyway , so , what do you want to put down ? I've put , seemed okay . Creativity , seemed okay . Um um flow of information on on any given subject given subject um sometimes disjointed .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I think it maybe could have been a slightly more creative project . I mean a remote control isn't the most um
D :  Yeah , the thing itself .
C :  kind of fancy thing that you could imagine designing .
A :  Um
D :  Yeah .
C :  I can't think of a better example at the minute .
A :  Have could have used a different
A :  example pel to increase create
D :  Yeah .
B :  Is this go It kinda kis fits the purpose that it was something everyone knows about and then
A :  Creativity .
B :  something we can at least look at and think how we can improve on .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  You have to do it within a set time frame is the other thing , so
D :  Yeah . But think like it was a bit restrictive just to say that you have to design a television remote control , in a way . I mean it depends what sort of business you're in , I guess . I mean this one seems . From the website it looks it's quite innovative , but we're coming up with some bucket shop product aren't we that's , you know , fifteen quid .
B :  one of those things . Like uh , companies can have like a range of products and
A :  I th I uh d
B :  I don't know how it works but I guess that something got sent out and have like a brief to kind of
A :  But the other thing is that uh they're I'm guessing that they're trying to use this um software to to demonstrate how you could uh do a project . I mean , m my wife at the moment , for instance , is uh acting as a computer um for um you normally , you got a problem , so you go to your tutor and find out information to see how to get it fixed . So what she's doing is she's having to spend a day at the computer terminal at one end so that any student that comes along can uh ask whatever question . And then you or the idea is that the whichever uh person's at the other end can point them in the right direction , show them where to either give them directly give them help , or secondly , point them in the right direction , either at the library , or uh or or come back , or go and see Joe Bloggs , or whatever .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So uh , and that was a project I suspect similar to this , because they they were actually trying to debug the uh computer software to enable um to enable it to work . And of course , you had the machine crashing and various things going wrong . So
D :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well , sh we look at the last slide , see if it's got anything else . I think there's one one more to go .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright , so we've got uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  I mean if you look at their products on their website here , Real Reaction , I mean it's all pretty high-tech and cutting edge . And
A :  New ideas found , did we find any , no .
B :  It was quite good with this um the white board , having that and the digital pens . Like , that's something that made it a little easier .
A :  Alright . Leadership , teamwork .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  we did find a new idea , I mean sort of a kinetic remote control . I've never seen one of them before . batteries , I think . So
B :  voice recognition , especially not could
A :  Does
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  You've got voice recognition computers , that's not remote controls .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well it's a different application of it .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay ,
B :  Yeah , so it's just like the same products , but just put together in a different way .
D :  Mm .
A :  so how do you reckon teamwork went ?
B :  Um
D :  That went okay , yeah .
B :  Yeah , I guess we all had separate ideas and then discussed them .
D :  Mm-hmm , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  To uh go uh reasonably well . Okay .
D :  I don't think sort of the budget um allowed us to do anything
A :  Bit bit arbitrary .
D :  Well , I mean I don't think it I just don't think it fitted in with the rest of their products . I mean , they've got all these sort of , you know ,
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  high definition D_V_D_ and
D :  portable seven inch d um lightweight computer screens , and uh I'm thinking , do you know , one cheap remote control doesn't really fit in . Surely they they should produ
A :  So , we're m we're meant to comment on leadership and the means , E_ G_ whiteboard , digital pens , et cetera . And and new i new ideas found was the the other thing .
C :  Well leadership's a bit of a funny one , isn't it .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But we can't really all fairly comment on leadership because you are the Project Manager . You were the leader . So our experience of leadership wasn't really
A : 
C :  as much as yours .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Now , I'd much rather be in marketing but I certainly didn't get this uh computer to work as well as I would have liked . However , um Alright uh means , so whiteboard um so really , it's uh equipment . Oh .
D :  Yeah . It worked . Comput computers could be a bit difficult at times but
C :  Yeah , very nice .
C :  But I mean , I d I don't I'm not sure I see the value in these . I mean , they record what you're writing , and then what do you do with it ? Where do you get the recording ? Do you plug the computer or something ?
D :  I think there's a little there's a little um chi
B :  So it's not just for us , it's for the experiment as a whole , so
D :  There's a little there's a little chip , I think you must plug it into something and it produces a
B :  Should we quickly look at the last slide ? Sh
C :  Right . I think you watch a video of it kind of .
D :  I don't know . Whether it just produces a big image of sort of everything you've written or something , and Page after page .
A :  Right . New ideas found , so one or two .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Kinetic powered remote control . Um ,
D :  what was the other one ?
C :  Voice um recognition thing .
D :  Vo yeah .
A :  um
A :  and uh
A :  uh , was it voice activated um
D :  Voice recognition , yeah . S
A :  recognition .
D :  Almost . To fill in these fill in these questionnaires
C :  Pretty much .
A :  Right , so , uh are the costs within budget , yes . Is the project evaluated , yes . Uh , don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . Then celebration .
D :  Oh no .
B :  . Is that everything ?
D :  Hmm ? I think that we've got two questionnaires and a report on the last meeting .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Uh , so we don't re So really
A :  I tried to save this the last time at twelve point three , and it didn't seem to have saved anywhere . Mind you , the the figure last was was different , but it should be poss
A :  Okay . Here we go .
A :  Alright , the agenda for thi oh .
A :  Alright . Um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . And then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave
A :  gave it . And um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . I have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . And um evaluate the product , as a group . And um
B :  Okay .
A :  So first we'll have the prototype presentation . Do you need the um PowerPoint for this ?
B :  Um yeah . I just got a few slides , so show them .
A :  Alright .
B :  Thank you .
C :  Um
B :  Do you want to present it ?
C :  This is what we came up with . It's a pretty simple design . It's um based on a mango ? Yeah . And we
B :  Yeah , here we are .
A :  On ? A mango . Okay .
B :  Mango shape .
C :  Yeah . And we have the company logo here and this will be the
C :  infrared here and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind yeah .
B :  The L_E_D_ .
A :  Oh . Okay .
D :  I'm sorry . What was the where's the L_E_D_ ?
A :  Oops .
C :  It's in the middle of one of the little R_s . And then the other one is the power . And uh we just have a simple design . We wanted it all to be
D :  Oh . Okay .
B :  So it's palm-held .
C :  accessible from your thumb yeah palm-held and all the
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  buttons are accessible from your thumb .
A :  Notice you have a number ten button .
C :  So you don't have to
C :  Oh that was a mistake , wasn't it ? Right no , that's a zero . Take that one off .
A :  Okay .
B :  You just need the nought .
C :  Sorry . I was in charge of the numbers .
A :  No problem . Ah .
C :  And this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or
C :  thirt the plus . You can go one , three or something . You press that first and then you go one three yeah .
B :  So one plus one would be eleven , or
A :  Oh . You press a plus button ?
A :  Oh okay . I've never heard of that kind before .
C :  Well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and
B :  Yeah because if you on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . So if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Oh , there's no e okay .
C :  So the plus and then yeah .
A :  Oh .
D :  Okay .
A :  But
A :  Would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ?
C :  No no , th all that's why we have all these numbers . These numbers um
C :  these numbers all work independently up to nine .
A :  Yeah but I mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . 'Cause you gotta press the plus afterwards .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Oh no . Uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine .
A :  Yeah I know , but if if I wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if I press the six it'll go to channel six , and then I'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ?
D :  Sixty .
C :  You p
C :  Oh .
C :  No you press the plus first . I I well it doesn't we haven't really s I would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , but she says plus press which what do you think is simpler ? It's a
B :  Oh .
B :  Well I don't mind , we can further define that .
A :  I th
A :  Um
B :  I wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah it wouldn't be a problem . But I was just wondering like as long as we realise that's what it'll do .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But I suppose it's not as snappy .
D :  Well the there is a there's a delay on remotes I think . Where you can have it it's like a five second input time . So as long as you hit them dada
C :  Oops .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah . If you don't put it
B :  Yeah . Yeah , that yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  it should be fine . As long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . So
B :  Um
D :  Was there so on the top there is volume and
B :  And channel , which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like
C :  A channel .
D :  Channel up volume up . Okay cool .
A :  C_ and V_ .
C :  Just so we can flick
A :  Right , where um where's the power button ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  It's in the middle of one of the little R_s .
D :  It's the R_ .
B :  It's the bigger R_ .
A :  Oh okay .
B :  So it's just like . We deci
C :  Yeah , so it's all accessible . Without m taking your hand off the remote .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . Uh e ergonomics are all considered . Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Oh okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Ergonomic , definitely ergonomic .
C :  And it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . Okay .
B :  It could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . But yeah , no I mean it's a different movement so yeah . Um and the feel of it , I mean , we've made this out of Play Doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . Um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-R_S_I_ um material is often used in stress balls so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , and it just feels feels different . Would you like to feel it yourselves ? How it fits in the palm of your hand ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  The spon yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Bit of a stress ball feel .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yes . I would .
A :  My goodness . There you go . Genevieve ? Yeah .
B :  Thanks . And you ?
D :  Yes . Oh it's nice . Oh I think I killed the five . I did . I killed the four . Oh god .
A :  And something hmm .
B :  Okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . But we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . Or the combination .
D :  Oh it smells good .
C :  Of Play Doh yeah .
B :  Um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish .
A :  Oh right .
C :  'Cause it'd be quite subtle and
A :  Yeah . It looks more
A :  Think like vanilla and banana would .
B :  Banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay yeah .
B :  So that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . I mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the yeah , seasonal .
A :  Kinda Christmas , you know .
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
B :  Apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki
A :  Yeah .
C :  The pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor .
A :  Cool .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . Um yeah we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , I mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-R_S_I_ and that's about it .
A :  Alright , thank you very much . Good work everyone .
D :  Bravo
A :  Alright . And so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . So , I have
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  something I'm going to
D :  You want the
A :  Oh wait a minute . Do you need to do a presentation first ?
D :  I don't know what order it goes in . I have one .
A :  Yeah . I'm gonna check that out for a second .
B :  Mm go
A :  What time is it anyw
A :  Oh yeah sorry you're right . Evaluation criteria is next in line . Yeah .
D :  Evaluation cri Okay . That's me .
D :  Hello .
D :  Oh there we go .
D :  Okay . Come on my computer . Come on .
D :  Sorry my computer's giving me technical difficulties . Should I press it again ?
A :  Just press um function eight again .
D :  Last time I did that it sh
D :  Okay . You're right .
A :  And then again I think .
A :  One more time .
D :  Oh . Still not there .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay now I think for this one I could Would you guys prefer use the whiteboard or mayb maybe I'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . Um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen .
D :  Um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um I made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . Um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do .
D :  Um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . So basically the lower p the lower the points the better .
D :  Okay so question number one . Does the remote whoops . Sorry . Oh I'm not gonna be able um , I'll do it on the whiteboard . I can't change it so I'm g I'm gonna ask you to push it down once .
A :  Okay .
D :  I'll write down our scores up on the
A :  Ooh .
D :  Okay so number one . Do we have a fancy look-and-feel ?
C :  Mm .
B :  Feel I think . We've been quite successful with the rubber coating and
A :  Yeah .
A :  The look is a little bit more playful .
C :  Well
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah I guess that depends on your definition of fancy , but it's definitely different . It's not your traditional yeah .
A :  Oh definitely different yeah .
B :  I think the colour has a lot to do with it . I mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that I think we would've necessarily chosen . It's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek red , black and yellow , and orange . Um
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Oh you were only given red and black ?
A :  Oh okay .
C :  Yeah so not very sleek and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . So we want it to be stand out that way , anyway .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . A metallic-y finish we were thinking .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well I know know it's for rubber . I mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours I think it would look quite fancy .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Polished . Okay
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . I kinda I like the potato look . It's very different . It's what ? Oh sorry the mango the mango look . Yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg .
C :  We we were we were thinking about yeah .
A :  It's mango . It's mango .
B :  Potato's fine . Potato's fine .
B :  Yeah . Totally . It's really adaptable .
D :  So I myself would say a one or a two .
A :  Yeah . I would say two . Personally .
D :  It's a two ?
C :  I w I'd say two I think .
D :  Okay , and p
B :  For the
C :  Fanciness .
B :  fancy
A :  Yeah .
D :  One being true . So
B :  I uh two , three .
D :  Two . Okay , actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . Okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? So I know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah and the use of the rubber .
D :  Use of the rubber , the use of the L_E_D_ .
C :  Yeah .
B :  For the anti-R_S_I_ .
A :  Yeah .
B :  The L_E_D_ use isn't particularly innovative and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , there's no L_C_D_ control , so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . In some aspects it is , like we said .
D :  Isn't
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I'd say maybe three .
C :  I'll go for three as well .
D :  Yeah . And I think I mean it it's tough to say because we were we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . So I mean I we'll put three , but I think we actually reached our goal .
B :  Yeah . Though it was our specification .
C :  No . Wouldn't be simple , yeah .
A :  Yeah we want it simple .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  We didn't want it any more than that . Okay question number three . Uh , will it be easy to use ?
A :  I think so . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah very . I think one for that . Yeah . No .
D :  Yeah . Yeah . S
D :  Yeah I think it's you can't really get confused with that . I mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system . But once that's figured out , it should be fine .
A :  Yeah . One .
B :  Yeah .
A :  The plus number thing .
C :  Yeah that's the only thing yeah .
B :  Yeah and perhaps the turning on but
D :  Number four . Is this a good-looking remote ? Remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly .
B :  Mm .
C :  It's definitely
B :  Again I think the colour comes into this .
A :  Yeah colour will definitely be a factor .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think that the logo could be smaller .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And maybe not such a prominent way . Maybe like at the bottom , kind of .
C :  But the
C :  Remember the management said that it it had to be prominent .
B :  Not in
D :  Whoops .
A :  Oh it just had to be on there I guess .
D :  Should just not touch it . This time it's the three I killed . I was just wondering if it should be like flatter .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Don't worry .
D :  Or
B :  I suppose I've got quite big hands .
A :  I like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand .
D :  Well
C :  Yeah . But you know what I've just thought of there now . What where's it gonna sit in your living room ? Is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ?
A :  Maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , and then the rest is like
D :  Yeah the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit .
C :  Yeah . But then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand .
A :  round .
D :  Oh . That's true .
A :  It would still be comfortable I think . We c we could handle it I think .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly .
D :  Maybe , it could it could be on the bottom , so you wouldn't loo like if it's flat here , so it sits up . Like that .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh that would be nice .
A :  Ah it'd fall over all the time though . It'd be annoying .
B :  Uh yeah , it's less um , what's th ha .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I g
D :  If it's weighted maybe . Details , details . Okay . So , is this a good-looking remote ? Would we wanna show it off to our friends ?
B :  H it's got higher centre of gravity like that .
A :  'Kay we're done designing . Come on .
C :  Three . You would though , 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think , it was another colour and it was like I think it'd look okay . I think maybe a two .
D :  Yeah ?
D :  I mean I gue yeah , it's personal taste , but
B :  I would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , but definitely in another colour , I'm not happy with those colours .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , so should we say two for that ? Yeah ?
A :  Sure .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . Uh , question number five . What's um will people be willing to spend twenty five Euros on this product ? Remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy .
C :  I think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic . So people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , I don't want to spend twenty five Euros . We have to market it .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it .
B :  Yeah . And the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , ooh no .
C :  And the kinetic energy part . Yeah . Don't shake
A :  Yeah .
D :  Shake it and the buttons fall off .
A :  Durable .
B :  But you know , those'll be firmly on .
C :  Oh no the plus . You're use the zero . Make a new one .
D :  No , I guess , I don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , but I know I am , aren't I ?
A :  But you're our Marketing Expert .
C :  I think they're about ten po ten pound , aren't they ? About ten pounds . Fifteen ?
D :  But you don't have to buy batteries . So in the long term this can actually save you money . So we'll market it that way too .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm , yeah , that's true .
A :  Oh . Exactly . Exactly .
B :  Yeah . Good point .
D :  So yeah I think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll
A :  Yeah . I would give it a two still though .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Okay number six . Can someone read it out ? Or
C :  Mm .
B :  Does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um yeah . So that was mainly that the statistics we said
B :  Yeah .
C :  I think it does very well .
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  Because yeah , because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . And it's just you won't have to think about it . You don't have to look down to find them . They're clearly there , easy to use . Simple .
C :  The zap yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah I guess the I think the key word there is average , 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . But they're not you and I really . So . Okay so one ? Okay . Number seven . C Heather could you push it down ? Will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? Remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . Now is there the is the alarm system still was it implemented ?
C :  Uh
B :  Yeah . Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  We have the alarm system .
C :  Yeah the bu when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra
B :  It
B :  Yeah l lights on and , or flash as well . But I mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm .
C :  It'll be again in the marketing .
A :  I thought the light from the inside was gonna light up .
C :  Yeah . The light it will .
A :  Or or was it gonna make a noise ?
B :  Yeah . But when the alarm's not yeah . If you
C :  But
C :  But both
A :  You press the button it makes a noise right ?
D :  It turns into a duck and starts quacking . Here I am . Um
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  You could s Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Awesome . Awesome .
C :  Oh , that would be brilliant . I'd be tempted to
B :  Well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , I mean , when it when it lights up as we I mean it could light up when the alarm went . But if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . So you can't see the alarm , but it would light up .
C :  Yeah .
C :  It would have to be in the market
A :  I though w it was gonna make a noise .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . Alarm , but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself .
C :  Yeah but you still couldn't see it .
C :  It would just be a little speaker on the back or something .
A :  Okay .
D :  We oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . But yeah , it'll be there . So we can we could say that
B :  Yeah . Yeah . It w yeah . Sorry .
A :  Oh okay . Whoo . Okay .
D :  We can give it a one , because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . Okay . Um
A :  Yeah , totally .
B :  Yeah . Sorry Heather . That wasn't very clear .
A :  No problem , mm .
D :  Question number eight . Will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? Remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . So it has to be yeah , it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . The plus thing needs to be worked on .
A :  Totally .
C :  So the plu the plus w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , won't it ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah I think just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , I think that in itself makes it so much easier to use .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well
C :  Yeah .
D :  Do
D :  Does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? So then you would have to push two buttons every time at least .
A :  Yeah , so it's just like channel six , six , enter .
C :  That kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press I don't know why .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah but you don't have to press zeros .
D :  You could just press six enter , or one two enter . Yeah .
C :  Oh okay . Right .
A :  And then like twelve , enter .
B :  And or sixty six enter , y
C :  Alright , aye .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah I think that's probably more straightforward . Yeah . Good
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um , okay so we can we'll say yes it's uh one ? Okay .
C :  I'd say w yeah one . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Ooh . Mm .
D :  Question number nine . Uh , will it minimise the effects of R_S_I_ , which was repeated strain injury ? Um , which affected over a quarter of users .
B :  Oh .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Injury .
C :  Hmm .
A :  I think so . It's like right in the
C :  But if you're zapping yeah . I don't think it will f
A :  Your thumb might get a little bit uh
B :  Yeah , that's what I was thinking . We may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about .
C :  Yeah , the biology .
A :  Yeah .
A :  But it is soft .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  It's soft , and
A :  And that's kind of what the um
C :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  the PowerPoint slide thing said would be good for R_S_I_ , so maybe it is but
D :  And people could
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I don't know what other options there are .
B :  I think we're getting that's true .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Could I mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . But there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . So , I think we did as as much as you can with a remote control .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So , one or two do you think ?
C :  I I'd say t two . Yeah .
B :  I think yeah , I think too .
D :  Two okay . Okay number ten . Did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? Now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? Is the yellow
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yes we did .
C :  Yeah .
C :  N We we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . It won't stand out . So n it's not always gonna be the same colour .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  It sounds like the colour's something that we
A :  Well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . So it could be grey on the banana one .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Gray , yeah .
C :  Yeah , could be grey .
A :  Yeah .
D :  But I mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , depending on the
C :  Yeah that's right , we didn't even rea
D :  So I think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the R_R_ .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah . I think this is the
C :  Yeah .
B :  the factor that we've been least successful in confronting .
D :  Okay .
C :  Perhaps a metallic or or like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . No ?
A :  Mm , yeah .
D :  Yeah . And the buttons in the middle .
C :  That isn't rubber .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . So , do you think that's more of a three then ? Three , four ?
B :  Four I think . Well I don't what do what
D :  Four ?
D :  Well we have good reasons for it , so we but we can still put a
A :  Hum .
D :  a four ?
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay , and final question . Um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? Current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess .
A :  I would say so .
C :  Following that briefing we did .
A :  But maybe more like two 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Like um the colour scheme names and stuff .
D :  Yeah .
A :  With the with the colours .
C :  Yeah .
D :  No , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? I think I missed a few they are ? So you can have banana and kiwi and okay . Okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , like maybe it'll become more
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  That's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It is .
C :  I think w yeah , I think one . Well that was our brief and we followed the brief . Well we haven't got a big banana but
B :  The thing is , I think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , I don't know if you'd instantly say mango .
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  Be like
C :  No .
C :  No .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe if it was scented . Yeah we have money for that . Um
C :  Oh that would be class .
B :  Oh yeah . There we go . That would be great .
B :  Um
A :  Alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ?
D :  Yes we do . So I wh what was I gonna put for that ? A two for fashion ?
A :  Oh .
A :  I would say two .
C :  Yeah . Two .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven
C :  It's
D :  is
A :  One point nine or something ? I don't know these things . Um , between one and two .
B :  It's
C :  Yeah .
B :  Between one and two .
D :  Between okay . Um .
B :  So that's pretty fantastic .
C :  Close to two . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one .
A :  Alright .
C :  I got
D :  Does that seem right then ?
C :  Yeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
C :  Uh , aye .
B :  It seems like it should be more around two .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Uh , should've added five .
B :  Do we have an online calculator ?
A :  I'm attempting to do that right now .
C :  This is .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah it is one point nine . Ooh .
B :  Oh wow . Well done . Well that's excellent .
C :  Yay .
A :  Go Heather Pauls .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . And um my computer's frozen .
A :  And now it's not . Okay . So
A :  um in our shared folder , if everyone could go there right now , um
D :  Sorry . Are you gonna do that ? Okay .
A :  I'm going to um steal a cable . Um it's it's um
C :  Is that the project document ?
A :  it's an Excel file . Oh .
B :  Production costs .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . 'Kay there we go . Um , production costs . And um I have to access that as well . One moment .
B :  It says it
A :  'Kay so far I've added what I think or what is going on ? Great .
A :  It's blinking at me .
A :  It's locked for editing . Read only . I'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . I have the original in my um
A :  my email account .
D :  Oh is it locked 'cause I'm in it ?
A :  I dunno .
B :  I think it just means that we can't add any more to it now . Have you have you completed it ?
D :  Or okay .
A :  No . No , I was hoping that you guys could .
B :  Oh right . Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um , there we go .
A :  Okay here we go . So we need to tally up how much our w our product will be costing . So um if you can look up at the screen , um the large screen , oh I guess looking at your own too and telling me which one you think . Okay we're using kinetic which is quite a large expense at three Euros .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh right .
A :  Um we're using a regular chip .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Um , it's cur it's double curved , so its curved all around . That's another three . We're already at five . Um , we're using plastic and rubber , so
B :  Double double-curved yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Good thing plastic is free , we're at eight . Um
C :  What about a special colour ? Are we using that ?
A :  Yeah . I guess we should do it just for one kind . So it's like special colour well we'll have two colours right ? Well one colour for the case , one colour for the buttons . So we can
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um , we have push button interface , so that's inexpensive . And um we have a special colour for the button , and we also have a special form .
A :  And a special material .
C :  And a special material . Yeah .
B :  Oof .
A :  Which puts us just barely under budget . Hurray .
B :  Congratulations guys .
D :  Mm . 'S good .
A :  Yeah . Good work guys . So um our operating cost is twelve twenty Euros .
C :  That's good .
A :  Awesome .
A :  And back to our PowerPoint . So we've
A :  'Kay . Yes we are . So we need to do a product evaluation , again , which is probably um
A :  I dunno . A different extension of a
B :  Of the actual project rather than the product ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
B :  A project ? Is is yeah .
A :  Yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork .
B :  So wh how we actually went round uh about doing it .
A :  Yeah . Alright so um
A :  Do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ?
B :  I think we were pushed .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Pushed for creativity ?
B :  I mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . So I think we could've done with a bit more time .
C :  The ma
C :  Or materials .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Ye Okay . So it'd be like
A :  need more time and
A :  materials . But you were allowed m creativity ? I think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah and the conceptual and functional . Like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea I guess , but m
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Well we were just limited by resources really and like if we had decided to use the L_C_D_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . So that did limit
D :  When we can down to it . Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
C :  Creativity .
B :  creativity . Just resources . But yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  The fruit and veg idea .
A :  Great .
A :  Leadership ?
A :  Is this me being like , guys do you like me ? Um .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Good leadership , I think we stayed on task .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah we did . We've , uh seeing as we've come out with what we intended . A pro um a product within the budget . I think that's a sign of good leadership and also our personal coach helped us along the way , so you know
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And the timing was good . We never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so
B :  I think it's been fine .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Good timing .
A :  Oop Okay . Teamwork ? I think we worked great as a team .
B :  And project manager of course .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Was good teamwork .
D :  I think we are well-suited to our roles .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Alright how were our means ?
B :  Um
A :  We needed more Play Doh colours .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah and more Play Doh , 'cause that was all the red we had . So even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we wouldn't have been able to .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it c it might've been bigger .
D :  Oh really ?
D :  Okay .
A :  But ever
A :  everything else was satisfactory ? Is that good
D :  Yeah . The computer programmes are good . The
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . It could be really straightforward for the computer . I think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays but I think I was the only one who struggled with that .
D :  Yeah . I don't think there was anything
D :  Yeah .
C :  I'm actually not sure if I've saved my presentations .
A :  Yeah ?
B :  Mm .
D :  They'll probably still be there .
B :  Uh me too . Yeah .
A :  New ideas found . I don't really know what that means .
B :  Well I think we've all learnt stuff from each other , like the n um yeah . Just about each different . Got new ideas from each other .
D :  Um
C :  Yeah . Through discussion .
D :  I'm not sure , new ideas found .
A :  Hmm ?
D :  Yeah well I guess we really it we bounced off of each other , which was cool . Like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and yeah , worked well .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  And we were a able to modify each other's ideas
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  to fit in with our areas of expertise .
A :  Yeah . Each other's
D :  Oh does it have smart materials by the way ?
B :  Sorry ?
D :  Does it have smart materials ?
A :  Mm .
B :  Oh yeah . Well mm , did it come into the into I dunno if we counted that in the costs .
D :  Oh yeah .
C :  If if it if it
C :  If it can be afforded .
A :  Okay ? Well with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide .
A :  Yes our costs are within budget . It's evaluated generally positively . And um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . Then we celebrate in such a way that I have no idea .
B :  Yes .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Uh .
D :  By watching T_V_ ?
C :  Yay .
B :  Fantastic .
B :  Okay , brilliant . Thank you very much .
A :  Alright ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , bye .
D :  Mm .
D :  Conclusion ? Dadada .
A :  Yep . Soon as I
A :  get this .
A :  Okay . This is our last meeting .
A :  Um I'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . Uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . Um then we will um do an evaluation . Uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . Then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget .
A :  Um then we'll do the evaluation , and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , or hopefully everything will fall right in line .
A :  Um let's see , minutes from the last meeting . Um we looked at uh the the trends . We had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . It was twice as important as anything else . Um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles .
A :  Um and a spongy feel . So we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . Um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . Um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . Um looking at other other devices . Um the iPod , we really liked the look of that .
A :  Um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . Um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . Uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . But I think we've still decided not to go with that . Then we looked at the components um
A :  the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . Um and basically
A :  how , what were making for the prototype . So I'm going to leave it at that and let you guys take over .
C :  The prototype discussion .
A :  The prototype yeah . Do you need a this ?
C :  No .
A :  Okay .
B :  Can try to plug that in there but
C :  There is our remo the banana . Um yeah basically we we st went with the colour yellow . Um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . Um but it would be held in such a fashion , where it is , obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic .
C :  These would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . So that's so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . Um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . You have to use your imagination a little bit . And this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through .
A :  Very nice .
C :  And the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an iPod , where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . Volume up and down . And then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . It's that that simple . That just represents the infrared uh beam .
C :  That's a simple on and off switch . Um I don't know , we could use the voice . T that blue bits should be yellow , d that that'd be where the batteries would be I suppose . And um that's about it . It's as simple as you , we could make it really . Is there anything you want to add ?
B :  Right . That's what we have there . That's plastic . Plastic covered with rubber . We might
B :  uh add some more underneath here . Maybe give it , give it a form . I mean you're supposed to hold it like that , but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , so yeah , you have some rub yeah . Exactly , use both . Might as well think about
C :  Yeah . Doesn't make much make much difference . You could work left-handed or right-handed I suppose .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  T the actual thing might be smaller . Yeah .
B :  Th think about the button as well . Like either put either one one on either side or
A :  What but what's that button ?
B :  not do it at all . It's a quick on-off button . That's um
C :  Just the on and off .
A :  Uh , 'kay .
B :  yeah I think it's pretty important . So you don't have to fiddle with that .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Right ? Um that's not um I'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . You wanna play with that over there . There you go .
C :  Yeah .
C :  It's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy Play-Doh , but
A :  Would you like to uh
B :  Right .
D :  Pretty impressive .
A :  Well done .
D :  Kind of a banana .
C :  And whether or not it would fall into the cost everything I suppose . With the scroll and the L_C_D_ .
A :  Well luckily we are going to find out .
A :  Or not luckily . Um do you have a marketing presentation for us .
D :  I do .
D :  Okay . You guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria .
D :  Um .
D :  Okay .
D :  So first I'll just discuss some of the criteria that I found . Just based on the past trend reports that I was looking at earlier . And then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . And then we will calculate the average score to see how we did .
D :  Um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . So
D :  we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale .
D :  And one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . With seven being false , we did not achieve that .
D :  .
D :  Okay .
D :  So for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ?
B :  .
A :  I think it's definitely different than anything else out there . So if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes I would say , I would say most definitely . It's bright .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I would .
C :  It's bright . It's
A :  It still has your traditional black .
C :  It's curved . It's not there's no sharp
C :  angles to it .
A :  Yep , not angular .
D :  Mm .
B :  I'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . However the colour , we don't have a say in that .
D :  Yeah I think the colours detract a little bit .
C :  Some people might say it . Yeah .
B :  That has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . So uh to answer that honestly I would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . 'S nothing you can say about that . I mean I much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . But
A :  Mm .
D :  That's true .
A :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah something more modern to go a a modern colour to go with the modern form .
B :  Right .
B :  Right . It's different . You don't want your uh
B :  three feet huge L_C_D_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that .
D :  Um okay so , do you think , since we
D :  This was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? Does that sound good ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  What do you think ? Three ? Four ?
A :  I would say
D :  Five ? Four is fair . Okay .
A :  four .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Very non-committal , four .
D :  Okay , the second one . Did we make it simple for new users ?
B :  It's very intuitive , I think yeah .
C :  Yeah . I think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had .
B :  S give it a one .
D :  One , 'kay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . Um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ?
C :  Uh yeah . 'Cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume . And then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . Yeah .
D :  I'd say that
B :  Right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  S scrolling through and selecting a few .
B :  Right .
D :  So one ? Yeah ?
B :  So that's a one .
A :  I think that's a one .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay um the fourth one . How about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? One of the number one complaints .
B :  Something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore .
C :  Yeah . It's bright yellow . Bright yellow's hard to lose . But um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . That , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . That was what we'd we'd mentioned .
D :  Whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it .
A :  So if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could
C :  Just just to use , to find it when it was lost . But like I said , like I don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . And it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . That's gonna be a difficult shape to
B :  Oops .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Well what
A :  And it is quite bright and
C :  Yeah . Maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ?
D :  Okay .
A :  Uh
C :  I mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , I mean a million ways . You can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it .
A :  Yeah .
D :  That's true .
B :  Mm .
A :  But if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit I think .
D :  Mm .
B :  Oh yeah . You probably
C :  Yeah .
A :  Probably two . You know . If we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  I'd say two .
A :  With the speech recognition , which of course may
A :  be changed depending on budget .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Y you could add an extra feature actually .
B :  Which makes this thing
B :  raise hell when you remove it too far from the television .
C :  Yeah .
B :  We could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far .
A :  Which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah true . But I mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . They're cheap . So it can't be that
D :  Annoying alarm or something ? Yeah .
B :  It's it's
B :  Um the it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . That can't cost much .
C :  expensive .
A :  Some sort of proximity
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your T_V_ and the other
C :  stick it on the T_V_ .
A :  Pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece .
B :  Right . That'd be tough then . Well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . Ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So . Are we adding one of these
D :  two features ? gonna say okay .
B :  Let's add one of those features and say yes .
A :  Okay .
D :  So we're back to a one ? Or a two ? Two , 'kay .
C :  Two .
B :  Two .
A :  Two .
D :  Okay . Are we technologically innovative ?
B :  Uh
C :  I'd say so . Uh don't get many mo remote controls with
B :  It's all just
C :  screens on .
B :  It's all just stolen technology when it comes down to right right right right .
D :  From iPod yeah .
C :  Yeah it's stolen technology . But we have .
A :  It's
D :  But for remotes yeah .
A :  But there's not a lot of yellow , there's not a lotta yellow . Course that wasn't really we were kinda forced to take that colour .
D :  Two ? Three ?
C :  'cause it's stolen . No maybe not .
A :  I don't know that we are that innovative , to tell you the truth .
B :  Yeah not really .
D :  But how many remotes do you see like this ? Not so many .
A :  If we added the screaming factor then we go up . Um I would say we're probably at four .
B :  Right .
D :  Really ? Okay . That's gonna hurt us . Okay . Um spongy material ?
B :  Yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of .
A :  We have some spongy , yeah .
C :  Yeah as much as as needed , I think .
D :  'Kay .
B :  It's not a one though . One would be the whole thing
A :  No .
A :  Yeah . Because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back .
B :  to fold and stuff .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So that's a four at most .
A :  Probably a four at most .
A :  Possibly even a five .
D :  And lastly , did we put the fashion in electronics ?
B :  Y yes . More
C :  Yeah .
D :  I'd say we did .
A :  If your fashion is b is Carmen Miranda , you betcha .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the L_C_D_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , but it definitely is
C :  On the
A :  It's true .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely .
B :  .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Alright . Now we just gotta calculate . Six eight twelve sixteen .
D :  Seventeen divided by s
C :  .
A :  Seven is
D :  Eight .
A :  Two point
A :  two point four ?
C :  Is that some long division ? No .
D :  Well I haven't done math in years .
A :  Something .
D :  What two I dunno .
C :  Just , I'm sure there's a .
D :  Okay we'll say two point four two .
D :  Right ?
D :  How does that look ?
B :  I'm impressed . I can't do that without a calculator .
C :  No I can't do long very impressive .
D :  It's been a while .
A :  And what what is the acceptable criteria ?
A :  Is there like a scale that we have to hit ?
D :  Oh no . They just told me to
D :  pick my own criteria and have you guys evaluate it basically .
A :  Alright then .
D :  So that's that .
A :  Okay . Well , let's see .
A :  Now we get to do the budget numbers . You didn't know that you were gonna have a budget .
A :  But we do .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . Yeah so . You'd been going a long time dividing that . It's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on .
D :  Oh my god . Okay .
C :  Two point four two basically .
D :  Yeah we'll go with that .
D :  Not too shabby .
B :  Fifty percent , you're kidding . P
A :  So I have here an
A :  Yeah .
A :  We want a fifty percent profit on this . Oh you can't really see that very well .
C :  Charge about three hundred quid for it .
A :  Twelve and a half Euros is what supposed to cost us . Okay , so
B :  It's too much .
A :  Well let's see . The f the
B :  Um
A :  Wonder if I can make this
B :  Uh
A :  What the
A :  Oh it won't let me do that .
A :  Okay .
A :  Alright so at top , I don't know if you guys can read that or not . I can't 'cause I don't have my glasses on , but so we've got the energy source . There's uh four , five , six categories . We have energy source , electronics , case . Then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements .
B :  Battery .
A :  Okay so
A :  Uh first of all energy source , we picked battery .
A :  Um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? Probably
A :  some e either two or four .
B :  Two .
A :  Two ?
A :  Like it .
B :  At four it's gonna be too heavy , so that that's not our problem . People can change it every month .
A :  Excellent .
B :  They won't know until after they bought it .
A :  This is consumerism . Alright so for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker .
B :  .
C :  We're advanced chip are we ?
B :  That's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah .
A :  'Kay , we have one of those .
A :  'Kay then the case is a
A :  Probably it's double curved .
B :  Double curved , yes .
A :  Case materials are plastic .
B :  Plastic .
A :  Um I guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . Is that right or is it just one ?
B :  N no . No that's just one .
A :  Maybe it's one because of the
B :  It's just one mo single mould , we can do that .
A :  'Kay .
C :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  I guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , which is nice . Special colour ?
B :  Exactly , right .
D :  Oh .
B :  That's not a special colour . It's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special .
D :  Bright yellow .
A :  Interface type . We have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an L_C_D_ display .
B :  S
C :  That's
C :  Yeah .
A :  So we actually have the L_C_D_ display
C :  And then
A :  and then is it the integrated or is it
C :  I'd say the integrated .
B :  Yes unfortunately .
A :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay . Button supplement ? Special colour ? Um special form ? Special material .
C :  Mm .
B :  We could of course make the buttons wood . Say mahogany or so
D :  It'd look really lovely . Yeah .
A :  Or titanium . They cost us all the same .
B :  Mm-hmm or titanium .
C :  remote control .
B :  Uh just
A :  Well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements .
C :  No that's getting a bit
C :  tiny .
A :  Um
C :  Yeah . I'd ignore that .
D :  Leave it blank .
A :  Okay . We're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a L_C_D_ and scroll . So our total is fifteen point five .
A :  Which I believe is
B :  Yeah that's too much .
A :  by three Euros over .
B :  It's hard to believe .
B :  So we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ?
A :  So the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake .
C :  If it w
C :  What if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . And just had a scroll wheel interface . And the L_C_D_ display . I suppose the L_C_D_ C_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though .
A :  Yeah 'cause the
A :  Well 'cause we have to have both right ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  I mean let's let's face it , it also depends on the software on the on the television . You can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . So s yeah let's take away the
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah you could maybe take out the L_C_D_ dis display even , if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the T_V_ itself .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Right .
A :  So we may not need the L_C_D_ display ?
C :  Uh that is possible yeah .
B :  Right . We may not need it .
B :  There you go . Perfect .
A :  Well there we go . Twelve point five .
C :  There we go .
D :  Perfect .
A :  Okay .
A :  So we just remove our
C :  Screen . Make it a bigger dial . Easier to use . Even easier to use then .
A :  screen here .
B :  Okay , the
A :  Besides look at what the L_C_D_ does to our lovely remote .
A :  Back to the design room boys .
B :  So we can just
B :  take away a heck of a lot of the there you go .
D :  .
D :  What's the blue part ? Oh that's the batteries . Okay .
B :  central ? Oh that's just yeah .
C :  That was just we ran out of yellow .
B :  There you go . Oops .
C :  There you go . Even simpler .
D :  Looks more like a banana .
C :  Yeah . For all those fruit lovers out there .
B :  There you go . One more criteria .
A :  Okay so the costs under twelve point five Euro . Was no . We redesigned it . Now it's yes . Next slide . Project evaluation . Uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . Um
C :  Yeah .
A :  So
A :  I guess that
A :  Let's see here .
A :  I think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . But
A :  I'd like to hear your thoughts .
B :  Fair enough .
D :  Trying to fill in some time there .
A :  Uh h what did you think of our project process ?
B :  Great .
C :  I think we did yeah I think we did quite well . Um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Good teamwork .
A :  Good .
B :  Just half a day , you have a remote . There you go .
C :  Yeah . Right from the start of the day .
A :  Yeah I think
C :  We sort of knew where we were going straight away I thought .
A :  we st we started off a little little weak . Our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . Um um
A :  But as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing .
A :  Um room for creativity ? There was that . Um I
A :  think we tried a lotta different things and um
A :  I think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things .
A :  Um you guys worked together well as a team . And um the means ?
A :  Which was the whiteboard and the pens .
C :  Yeah . We've used the whiteboard .
B :  Super super .
A :  I had some problem with the pen I think , but minus your p
D :  Minus your PowerPoint fiasco .
B :  Well that's not my fault . That's obviously the people I work for uh that work for me , uh they've just you know
D :  No I know . I'm yeah . Incom
A :  Well
A :  Have a we have a list of employees that you would like fired .
B :  Heads are gonna roll , believe me .
B :  Yes yes .
A :  Okay . N new ideas found ? Um
D :  Mm . Kinda .
A :  Yes for the remote . Maybe no not f for
C :  Technology used .
A :  technology .
A :  Alright . Closing . Costs are within the budget . Project is evaluated .
A :  Um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . That's it .
C :  Excellent .
A :  And I still have to do my minutes for the last meeting .
A :  Actually .
A :  Um so there will probably be another
A :  questionnaire coming up .
D :  We might have a while though .
A :  And then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . But that's the end of our meeting .
B :  .
A :  So
A :  Hello .
D :  Good afternoon . Sorry I'm a little late . Got stuck in the traffic .
A :  No problem .
A :  Okay . That's possible on uh this time of day . Starts at three o'clock . Uh Uh , let me see . Our fourth and last meeting .
D :  Yeah .
A :  There he is .
A :  Yes .
A :  Okay this our last meeting . In this meeting we will discuss our final design . And we will do some evaluation about the , not only the product , but also the project . And then we're going to close the project today as well . So after this you will be uh free to go and uh spend all your money .
A :  And this uh design , detailed design meeting uh we will discuss uh the look-and-feel of the design , the usability interface design , and we will do the product evaluation . Um , in order to do that we have this agenda .
A :  We'll have the prototype presentation first . Then we will set up some evaluation cri um criteria . Then we will look at the finance . Uh we will have to see if everything we wanna do is also possible within our budget . Because everything costs money , and the more functions you wanna have the more money it will cost . So we have to see if it fits within the twelve and a half Euro per remote .
A :  But we will see that later . Then we will do the project uh evaluation , and the closing after that . We've got forty minutes . So we will be finished at half past three . But first um
A :  we will do the this is prototype presentation . So , if some yeah if somebody wants step forward .
C :  Okay .
C :  Well this is what me and Richard came up with . The default spot for the on-off button . The mute button just below that . Then there's the volume and channel selectors .
C :  Simple plus-minus button . Uh we thought of a help button . If you hold it and you press another button , uh the help goes to the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Then there's the zero to one to zero buttons . A button for teletext . A button for the subtitles . And the company logo .
C :  So it's rather simple prototype . And uh we'll have to see from testing uh how the users take it .
A :  Okay .
D :  Um , is this the moment where we ask or can ask questions about the functionality ?
B :  So
C :  Sure uh just pop in at any time .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Um , when you're in teletext there usually are buttons where you just you just press it and you g go to the next teletext page .
B :  Uh , that's just uh the normal uh as th as the normal uh remote controls uh So um
B :  You put it uh you um came in uh page uh one hundred . Now you can use the normal uh one to zero buttons . And you But you can also uh use the um button th for uh changing the the channel .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  S so uh the shifting uh button . Uh for uh yeah shif shifting up in uh on t on t uh teletext , and shifting uh down . So
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay . Um
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Uh but um I thought in a few meetings earlier we uh uh tried to keep it uh simple . Uh just a few buttons and large buttons . But uh I think these are altogether quite a quite a few buttons .
B :  Oh yeah ?
A :  So I'm wondering if we if we neely really need all of those buttons .
C :  I think if you look at
C :  most controls , they've got more buttons than this . And well the on-off button , it's it's a necessity . You can't drop that one . The volume and channel buttons , you need you obviously need those those .
A :  That's right .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  The mute button could be replaced uh by pressing the volume-down button twice . So we could cancel that one . I think the help button really is necessary because there's no other way to know when someone wants to know what a button does .
B :  Yeah yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Uh , or you can build in uh when you press uh one button uh uh Yeah . But m Yeah . We disc discuss that already . But uh we think uh old people uh don't know that uh option . So uh they just put in uh put press uh the button and uh
A :  Long time . Yeah . If you put
A :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  Well , you can't
C :  leave out the number buttons I guess .
B :  And uh
A :  Yeah . Uh teletext and subtitles are yeah necessary . Okay .
C :  And
C :  Yeah . So it's rather basic already .
B :  Oh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Think so . That's what I pointed out earlier . If you just make a control for just the T_V_ there's just not much to gain here .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay . So we had somebody about th interfa Something about the design of the buttons there ?
C :  Yeah , they're It's rather hard to draw on the white-board . But they're supposed to be equal sized , round , with a with a little logo on it for the for the volume , the the triangle and stuff . Just for recognition .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , it
A :  Just n normal plain buttons .
B :  Yeah yeah . Just to recognise it , so uh
A :  Yeah . 'Kay .
B :  Uh yeah and now we don't need uh LEDs or um
A :  No .
B :  Y uh s some uh remote controls uh do it also , but um uh because we use the little display we don't uh have to use it . Uh so
A :  No .
A :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  So and for the materials we've just chosen for rubber buttons . With a a different colour than the case . So they jump out .
B :  Nay .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay . That's nice . Then because we only have thirty minutes left , I will move on to the finance part , which is pretty exciting , to see if it's all possible what we wanna do . And I can tell you
C :  And uh that's about it .
A :  that we're going to have a pretty hard time producing this for twelve and a half Euros .
B :  Mm .
A :  If we see I don't know if I've filled in correctly , so just correct me if you see uh something wrong . I counted two batteries . But maybe we can also use one . I don't know if it's possible .
D :  Since it rechargeable .
A :  It's rechargeable . That's right .
B :  Yeah we can u just uh
A :  Okay . That's two Euros off . We need the advanced chip . So there's not much to uh
B :  'Kay .
C :  Yep .
A :  to save there . Here we have the single curves . Uh we can see that the difference between uncurved and the single curved is one Euro . Um ,
B :  Mm .
A :  I don't know , but I think the single curved is good for design , and also for the display to have a prominent place on the remote control . I think we have to keep that .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Then we have the case material supplements . It's plastic . It's the cheapest one we need . So that's uh not much to save either . But then the biggest costs are the buttons .
A :  So maybe we really should try to discard some buttons to uh keep our costs low . Because you have to we will have to get the twelve and a half Euros at the end . Um ,
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  so if we Let's fir first count the buttons we have now . Because I Sixteen . Nah , that will be even more then . Eighteen Euros .
B :  Uh
B :  Sixteen , I believe so .
A :  So ,
B :  Uh seventeen .
A :  seventeen .
D :  Um
B :  Uh with the help button .
C :  Yep .
A :  Okay , including the help ? Yeah . Uh seventeen . I think we can uh discard the help and the mute button
D :  Damn .
B :  Yeah .
A :  uh by pressing down volume long , or pressing down a a number
B :  .
C :  Yep .
A :  long . That saves us uh one Euro already . 'Cause then we have got fifteen I think ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Wouldn't Yeah . No . That wouldn't be an option .
A :  Fifteen buttons .
A :  And this is
D :  Uh , d I assume you'd count the volume and channel thingies for two buttons each , right ?
A :  No those are one , I think .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well , think actually there're two buttons , aren't they ?
B :  Where did uh
B :  Uh , it's just one button . But , um
B :  Yeah . There were uh two uh for one big button . But they are uh more expensive than the small ones . Uh , yeah . So
A :  Yeah but th it's not stated in this files . So maybe we can we can even make one button with the volume and the channel in one , by pressing
B :  It's just a .
D :  Well I was thinking , maybe you could just integrate three of those numbers to one button .
A :  That's possibility as well .
D :  That would cut the cost .
A :  So And it's good for the design as well . So you can make
A :  Uh let's see . If you make this
A :  Looks a bit like uh
A :  a cross .
A :  Plus . Min .
B :  But I don't don't know if if it's cheaper . So uh , we've still got four buttons , but just um So
A :  Uh s yeah channel . Yeah w
A :  Yeah th I think they count uh the materials .
B :  You got uh not not a butt button itself , but uh on the um
A :  Yeah on the chip there . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . On the chip you've got still uh four uh four buttons . So
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  That's right . That's right .
D :  Yeah .
A :  But I think because we have the advanced chip we can just count this as one button . But No but I think
B :  Yeah , but
D :  But , I think this really is four buttons anyhow .
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah . Maybe it is , but then it seems to me that it's impossible to get the twelve and a half Euros . Also the L_C_ display , I think it's , I think it's too expensive for the display we use . I think they uh try t
D :  Yes .
C :  Uh that's that's a big cost .
C :  If we leave out the display we can also save money on the chip .
A :  That's right , but what's the big advantage of our remote then ?
D :  Only the docking station , I guess .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Which isn't the the docking station isn't even in this c s schematic .
A :  No . That's extra . That's extra . That's right .
C :  So it's not even taken into the price .
D :  Maybe we should to a different supplier .
A :  That's an option . Poland . Something . Polish supplier . Don't you think we can , if we can count this as v as one button , and integrate th uh these buttons in three , then we save a lot of money as well .
D :  Yeah .
C :  We we could save money on it . But would it make the remote more usable for elderly people ?
B :  .
D :  Yeah , that's what I'm wondering .
C :  My mother can't even send send an S_M_S_ message .
C :  So
A :  Yeah . That's a point .
D :  Um
B :  Are we gonna buy a um a remote control uh when you can uh use it ? So um
B :  Yeah .
B :  We m uh we must um stay below the um below um twelve uh fifty or Can't uh go um
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
A :  No .
D :  Well , since the market research
D :  indicated that older people spend their money easier , more easy , maybe it's feasible to just put the price of the remote up a little . Especially since we have those nice features .
B :  Nay .
A :  Yeah but uh we have to stick to the twelve and a half Euros . We don't have any more budget to develop it . Yeah . So
C :  The margin will get too small . Yeah .
B :  Is it impossible to
B :  But it is possible to make one uh for uh twelve fifty .
B :  I don't think so .
A :  It is . If you leave out the L_C_ display . And if you use less buttons .
D :  It would be a be a pretty rigid one .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Say Or you can take the single chip .
C :  Ten .
B :  But , you can't use uh
A :  There it is .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But we want to make a
B :  uh so uh uh fancy and a good uh Yeah .
A :  But then w
A :  Good looking .
B :  Uh , wi with n Oh , with uh
A :  Yeah .
B :  attractive uh o options . So uh , you can stay uh below uh twelve fifty . So
A :  I think it's uh difficult as well , but
D :  Or b
D :  Basically becoming a choice between like either a good remote and a higher production cost , or just any other remote control .
C :  No remote .
A :  Or we can leave out the ten buttons and take one scroll wheel for the programme numbers .
B :  Scroll-wheel's one .
A :  Then w
C :  That's
A :  Because then we save ten buttons . Then we have five and one . And and see . If we have this one and we've got the advanced
B :  No , it
B :  Yeah .
A :  W uh , we're getting close .
C :  We're getting closer .
B :  Yeah .
D :  But how does scroll-wheel work here ?
A :  Then you will
A :  Or maybe you can
A :  um scroll . If you scroll you will see the numbers on the L_C_D_ display . Until you've got the right number , then you push it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  That would bring up the price of the scroll-wheel also .
A :  Alright . It's gotta scroll and push . Okay but then you you can push uh some other button as well .
D :  Integrated scroll-wheel push-button . But Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  You could just not scroll for a half a second .
A :  Yeah . That's right . So if you scroll to a number and then you wait a half second , then it g turns to that channel .
C :  So you won't need a button .
D :  I think that would be like the end of our usability .
A :  But it would definitely crop cost , a lot . And we need the battery .
B :  D yeah .
D :  Yeah , but
A :  And the regular chip is not possible ? It has to be advanced ?
C :  If you want to use an L_C_D_ screen you you need an advanced chip , yes .
A :  It has to be advanced . Yeah . Okay . And we can save a Euro by a flat design .
B :  Hmm .
A :  That's an option we can Then we're almost there .
C :  Yep .
B :  Ja ja .
C :  Yeah if you v could just leave out one more button .
A :  Yeah . So if we
B :  Yeah , or we have to uh skip the subtitle uh button .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah but I think that's That is a big advantage , if we're
B :  So Yeah
B :  Yeah it's a big advantage . But um , it's
A :  But
A :  Can we use can't we integrate the teletext and the subtitles in one button ?
C :  I think so . Yeah .
B :  Uh , yeah .
A :  If you push it three times ?
D :  Well , think it's pretty much the teletext subtitles are right now you just push the teletext button , go to page eight eight eight , and teletext disappears . But the subtitles stay there .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B : 
B :  But if you push the teletext button twice
D :  I think that's the case on most
C :  What if you have to scroll to page eighty eight ? Eight hundred eighty eight .
B :  It's uh
B :  One m uh one b uh , a few buttons .
A :  Ah that's not really that
D :  Well , that could be just uh like the scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click , scroll to eight , click .
C :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  But then again that would be d j just pretty much not an option for older people , who don't even know what a scroll-wheel is .
C :  No .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Holding a
A :  No .
D :  remote with which they expect to have like ten buttons for the numbers one to zero .
D :  With only five buttons on it .
D :  And a scroll-wheel .
A :  I think if you make a good advertisement uh on television and in the in the guide , you can explain to the people how to use the scroll wheel .
A :  If you just make it real simple .
A :  Because it saves it saves a lot of money . And we can keep our L_C_D_ screen , which can provide extra information . How to use the scroll wheel . How to use the other bu buttons as subtitles .
D :  True . True .
B :  Hmm .
A :  And it's good for the innovative design as well . If you would erase these .
A :  Mm eraser ?
A :  And we put uh
A :  Looks a bit odd maybe .
D :  That's a pretty big scroll wheel .
A :  That is
A :  Something like that . Then , yeah . We've got the scroll-wheel . One , two , three , four , five buttons , if we erase this one .
A :  And these are two buttons then .
C :  We could make two buttons out of that . And just um
C :  If you press the volume button you can control the volume with the scroll-wheel .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So that would save two buttons . If you do the same for the channel .
A :  Yeah .
A :  That's really a good good idea , I think .
A :  And it will make the use of the scroll wheel uh more obvious indeed .
C :  More obvious .
A :  So we make one for the volume , one for the channel .
A :  Plus scroll . That's right . So we've got one , two , three . Yeah , we can leave the teletext in if we want .
C :  So if we
C :  Yeah . So
B :  Yeah .
A :  That's m that's better .
D :  So this is five buttons .
C :  If we leave out all those buttons , perhaps you can go with the flat flat case . And make it smaller overall .
C :  So if you put the the volume and channel buttons on the same height as the on-off button , the screen right behi under that , than the scroll button
A :  Y yeah .
A :  Mm yeah .
A :  Uh yeah , and then you can
C :  you get a a much smaller remote .
B :  Uh yeah .
A :  That's right .
C :  And it
A :  So we can
A :  decrease this one to four buttons .
C :  Yeah ?
D :  Right now we have five .
B :  But uh , you can make a f quite a big uh remote remote control for uh just the same price as a small one . Just uh you only have to pay for the double curved or single curved . It uh it's a bit uh
A :  Yeah . That's no problem .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . It's uh it's more the moulds in which they are being made , I think . Single curved is really easy to just fill in . And cases come right out of the machine . And single curved you have to have a different uh different machine , than a flat one .
D :  Mm .
B :  .
A :  I think this is a really easy one . Um ,
A :  what does everybody think about a flat or a single curved design ? Freek , what do you think ?
D :  Well , I still think we should go for the single curve design . But then again ,
C :  Yeah .
B :  .
C :  Richard's argument was very good . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  all these changes are not really okay with me . But since
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
A :  We have to cut costs . Yeah . Yeah I'm ag
D :  we just have to .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I'd rather just go to the board and
A :  Ask for more money .
D :  get us to spend eighteen dollars a a remote .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I am agreeing with the usability . Yeah .
D :  Or do some market research and see what the options are .
A :  Yeah . But th um I think we can then keep the single curved one . Just to express our L_C_D_ screen a bit more . So people will use it more , and especially for the help functions , it will be good if we have scroll bar , scroll button . It will be necessary to have good help function , as well .
C :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So this is scroll .
A :  I think it was better to have this price list a bit earlier . Before we went on to the to the whole design .
D :  Yes . Definitely .
B :  The th
A :  But
A :  I'm glad we could make a bit .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It's pretty different , if you saw the last one than this one .
D :  It's pretty different . But this is not really like for the group we were making our remote . This will really require a lot of marketing
B :  No .
A :  Yeah . It will .
D :  to get this to sell .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But um
D :  'Cause if older people like familiar forms and familiar stuff . This is not familiar for them .
A :  No , but I think
D :  So we're gonna have to do a lotta convincing them .
A :  I think the most
B :  But they know the scroll-buttons from uh old radios . Uh they cal also uh buttons like that for uh changing uh channels . So maybe it's uh
A :  That's right . We can let l We can stick it out , a bit . Like a old old buttons . Maybe that's recognisable for them as well . Yeah . That's a good one .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So , I'm afraid we have to move on . And it's uh it's b uh less frightening , I think . If they see this design they think oh , there are only five buttons , and uh But we will see .
B :  Yeah .
D :  That's true . Might uh might be confusing too .
A :  Yeah . That's definitely right .
D :  They'd be like , what ? Only five buttons ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But very special , so uh
A :  I would buy it .
D :  Yeah . But you're not sixty .
A :  That's right . I would buy it if I was six . No I don't know . What it costs under twelve and a half Euros ? No ?
A :  Uh , yes they are .
B :  No .
A :  No . But we can go on with the project evaluation .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Let's see . I can sit down I think . We still have fifteen minutes left , so we're nice on schedule .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um , the project process .
D :  So um , I like set up all these criteria .
A :  Evaluation criteria . That's right . That was the the point I forgot .
D :  And evaluation of the
D :  thingy .
A :  I should
A :  There we are . Evaluation criteria . Go ahead . We've got five minutes I think for those criteria . No we've got fifteen minutes but
D :  Thank you .
D :  Five more minutes ?
D :  Okay .
A :  Uh yes . What ?
D :  'Kay so I did some literature study study , and analysis of the requirements we set up earlier .
A :  Uh yeah .
D :  Translated it into criteria , which would be these . Um , is the remote fancy ? The shape , look and feel . Innovative ? What new functions are there ? Uh , easy to use ?
D :  Uh , learnability is a very important factor here . Uh , is it functional ? Are there not too many functions uh among the functions ? And are the those functions that are there , are they useful ? And the cost .
D :  The target group . Is the remote really for the group we're making it for ? And recognability . If our company is If it is easily recognisable that our company made it ?
D :  And
D :  So we're supposed to evaluate it right now .
A :  Okay .
D :  Let's see .
D :  Oh I have to say this was a little hard , because the minutes of our last meeting
D :  were not here .
A :  Yeah , that's because my pen failed to upload his data . I tried to but it's uh it's giving errors by downloading the software .
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah ?
D :  Interesting .
D :  So
B :  Mm . 'Kay .
D :  Is the design fancy , on a scale of one to seven ?
A :  I think it's fancy .
C :  Six .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh six . Yeah .
D :  We all go for six ? Good .
A :  Six .
D :  Um , is the design innovative ?
B :  Mm . Sh
A :  Very . Subtitles , buttons . Yeah . Seven . Yeah . So we've got twenty cents for our docking station , huh ?
D :  I think so , with our L_C_D_ screen , docking station , scroll-buttons .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Seven ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Should be do-able . Is the design easy to use ?
A :  Yeah . That's right .
B :  Mm . Not really .
A :  That's a bit dodgy .
D :  Well
D :  Would be for us . But
B :  For old people I I
A :  I would say four . Four or five between . Between four or five .
C :  Four or five . Yes .
B :  W Yeah . Four .
D :  I'd go for four , too .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Is it functional ?
D :  Is the design functional ? Um , do we have all functions that we want to include ?
A :  Yes .
B :  N Yeah .
D :  I think we do . Do we have too many functions ? I don't think so . It's pretty slim .
C :  No .
B :  No .
A :  No .
A :  Think it's uh seven .
D :  Seven .
D :  Oh , and do we um
D :  take care of the biggest frustrations of the remote control ? Like it getting lost and
B :  Mm m
D :  R_S_I_ influences ? Think we do .
C :  Mm , we haven't thought of that one .
A :  It was . I had them worked out .
A :  Mm . They are ugly , not very functional , and getting lost .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Are the production costs within the preset limits ? Well they are now .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Does the design fit the group of focus ?
C :  I think that's a three .
B :  Mm , th yeah .
D :  Yeah . I think it doesn't .
A :  No I think with our new radio button , I think it's uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh
A :  I think it's better .
B :  We have to test it s But
D :  I don't know .
C :  I still I think it's too m too fancy . Too too flashy .
D :  I think
A :  I think it
D :  I think a radio button is not exactly what older people expect to have a remote control .
B :  Uh , yeah , true .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I would give it a four .
D :  I'm not sure . I think I'd go for two .
B :  I go for three . So
A :  Then we have to do the three . It's the
D :  'Kay .
D :  Is the company company recognisable ? Well , we have the logo there .
A :  Yes it is . Yeah .
B :  Yeah yeah .
D :  So
A :  And they wanna put fashion in their products . Uh in the slogan of the company . And we have the removable front cases . So , I think it's very recognisable . Yep .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So that will be this .
D :  I was also supposed to calculate the score , but
D :  thought we would have another private thingy after this .
A :  We've got a calculate it .
A :  Mm ?
C :  Twendag sieven an twendag .
D :  Is this Like after this , are we done ? Or
A :  N We've gonna We're going to evaluate it .
D :  We're gonna go to our other room again .
D :  Well , anyhow . These are seven factors times seven is forty
D :  something . Two ?
D :  No . Nine ?
A :  Forty nine .
D :  Uh , minus one .
D :  Minus three , minus four .
D :  Minus four .
D :  So that would be minus eight .
D :  Forty one out of forty nine .
A :  Forty one .
A :  That's
A :  Around eighty percent . What is it ?
D :  Okay .
D :  Guess I'll just type that in on the bottom here .
A :  That's eighty four percent .
B :  Hmm .
A :  I think that's a pretty nice score .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm . 'Kay . So that will be the evaluation .
A :  Okay . Thank you .
A :  So ,
A :  that brings us to the project evaluation .
A :  Yep .
A :  Thank you . Project process . Did we move through the right phases , you think ? Along the process ?
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah . But it
D :  Think we should have a should have had the finance thingy a lot earlier .
B :  Yeah .
A :  That's right .
D :  In the design phase .
A :  So lack of information about prices .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . That's true .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Definitely .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh
A :  Okay . Satisfaction . Was there room for creativity ?
D :  No .
A :  No ? It's because of the finance sheet . Yeah .
D :  Not too much . No .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , there w there was enough room , but the finance uh
D :  Yeah , true . But
A :  The room was Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  And I would've liked to go for the
D :  younger users also .
B :  .
D :  And just to be able to access internet and
D :  get something of your own .
B :  Mm .
A :  Restrictions .
A :  Internet access .
A :  'Kay . Leadership . Was it clear what everybody had to do uh according to their roles and functions ?
C :  Yes .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Teamwork ? Did it work out ? Working together ? Also , you two of you with the uh last phase ?
B :  So
C :  Yes , was okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Nice .
C :  The tasks are very structured , so you can just do step by step and it's very easy .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  tasks .
A :  Okay .
A :  Were the means sufficient for the tasks uh we had to do ? Or were they too much ?
C :  Well , the smart-board , the d d drawing is just a pain in the ass , but
B :  Mm .
C :  The digital the digital pen is very nice .
A :  Smart-board .
B :  Yeah .
A :  If it wants to download its uh data .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  But
C :  Yes . Yeah .
B :  Uh
A :  Failed download .
A :  Smart-board was irritating .
A :  So you rather wanted to have a flip-over ? Or something else ?
C :  A flip-over or a more precise uh
B :  Yeah . A flipper's uh easier , so
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Faster as well , I think . Yeah .
C :  digit Yes .
A :  Flip-over .
B :  But if you want to share uh of uh when you make um a picture like this uh on the presentation , it's easier to uh share it with uh other people . Uh so uh you can sh save it uh and uh put it on the internet , or uh uh in shared f uh folder or uh sh uh shared directory . So
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I tried to open the file on my laptop , but
B :  So Yeah ? No ?
C :  No . Didn't work .
D :  not possible .
A :  Uh you need a smart board uh application I think .
D :  Yeah .
B :  T can uh can you export it uh like a Yeah .
A :  But I think you can Yeah . Should be possible . Yeah you can export it as image .
D :  no .
A :  Must Yeah must be
D :  Should've done that then .
A :  So the sharing of the information was uh was okay ?
B :  .
D :  Pen is here .
C :  Yes .
A :  Uh , network . Yeah , pen is here on the table .
B :  Uh .
B :  Uh , yeah .
B :  So you can Uh
A :  Yeah . It's possible .
D :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  It's possible .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  That's nice . Have we found new ideas for
A :  having this kind of meetings ? Or
B :  Um , yeah maybe um uh when we n uh just uh give the numbers of of uh
B :  Uh uh o one of uh out of s uh sev Um it's uh easier to uh to do the th things that are like that on a computer . Uh , so uh just l uh like uh at u university uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So
A :  Yeah . So everybody puts his own score . And then it mediates the score , and you can get one Yeah . That's better . So that's uh
B :  So
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  How do we call ?
A :  criteria .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm , any more ideas ? Or questions about the project ? Or about the product ?
B :  Mm .
A :  Because I think
A :  then that we get to our last sheet .
A :  Are the costs within the budget ?
B :  Mm yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  They are .
C :  Considering we are not going to make a docking station .
A :  Do we
A :  Docking station . That's a good point . But maybe because of the docking station the price of the remote can also be a little bit higher ?
B :  .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Perhaps .
A :  Uh and I think you can compensate that as well .
B :  Mm .
A :  So I think that shouldn't be the biggest problem , because it's very cheap to make as well .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Do we think we gonna get the twelve and a half million ? Or what was it ? Fifteen fifteen million . I think we will . If we gonna export this product . It's innovative . Especially in America . People are pretty decadent .
D :  Fifty grand .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Mm .
A :  Sometimes .
D :  Yeah , still I think I mean if we're n gonna make a scroll-button anyway
B :  Yeah .
A :  You can do more .
D :  it'd be more for the younger people than for the older people . So maybe we should just re-focus .
B :  Ah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Just put it on the market for everybody . You can you can change markets where by changing the front covers . That's one thing you can change it with . So you can also try to uh reach the younger people by uh putting fancy covers on on the market . Just as a test . See how it works . That's I think a good advantage .
D :  Or specifically for younger people .
B :  Ah .
B :  Ah .
D :  That's true .
D :  Yeah , I think then it would be way more uh popular with younger people than it is , than would be with
D :  older people .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Even if it were their covers .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Uh , uh then I think we can have our little celebration , right now .
D :  But
B : 
D :  Party party .
A :  That's it . Yeah . I think we still have to fit in one more questionnaire . I think . I don't know . I didn't get a message
B :  Where's the champagne ?
D :  'Kay .
A :  from the from ending of the Oh I think I have one now . Five more minutes ? Oh that's nice .
B :  Uh , I believe y uh
D :  Oh you did .
B :  Okay .
A :  Then we still have some questions . If somebody has some questions they can ask them now . Or we can put these in the project folder as well . Maybe that's
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Export as picture , I think .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm . This is another network , I guess .
A :  Does somebody see the project folder ? I don't .
A :  Hmm .
A :  My Documents .
B :  Uh maybe uh they will save it . So uh
A :  Yeah , I'll just put it in My Documents and uh That's okay .
D :  Yeah , it probably will .
A :  Okay .
A :  I think I'm going to make our final presentation now .
D :  Oh yeah , you're supposed to make a final
A :  And then I will be back in about ten minutes to show you the final presentation .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  Summary of the project .
D :  Are we supposed to go into our own rooms again ?
B :  Uh maybe we have to fill uh another questionnaire . So uh
A :  Yeah . Questionnaire . I think you all get a questionnaire in in your room . And then I'll meet you in I think about ten minutes , or something . Okay . Thank you .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Hopefully my pen will download its software .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Oh .
A :  Or data .
D :  That'd be nice .
A :  Oh .
B :  It's not saved yet .
C :  Okay .
B :  So
A :  Okay .
B :  Our beautiful drawing .
A :  So just f um
A :  So this is our agenda . You're F You're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me .
D :  Oops .
C :  Okay .
A :  Uh I didn't Oh yeah .
A :  So these are the
C :  Oh , okay . Yeah .
A :  So these are the um last notes we I made . If anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . I don't have to put it in the report .
B :  Are we doing the the speech recognition ? Because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well .
A :  Okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . So if you want to , it's okay .
B :  Okay yeah . Well then then we're gonna put it in .
A :  Okay , just
B :  Yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , but it should be uh
C :  Yeah , and Or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? Or fold open ? I don't know .
A :  Slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls .
C :  It's probably better .
C :  Yeah , s Like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions .
B :  It's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well .
A :  Maybe that's better .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's that's a very good point .
B :  Okay , so when you have a lot of room inside . So you can make it very easy to use . 'Cause you can write a lot of comments besides it .
C :  Think that's better .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . So this is okay ?
B :  No . Yeah , we're gonna use the advanced chip then .
A :  Okay , so that's Uh I'll just have a look how much that is . But um Okay , for the Okay . No , you have a different chip for speech recognition . So
C :  The
B :  Advanced chip was for uh spee Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I I think so . I don't know .
C :  Ah okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  So I already calculated that and it's still in the budget . So it's okay .
B :  Good .
A :  So you can show your prototype if you want to .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Together ?
C :  Yeah , it's Let's do it together . Okay .
B :  I'll give comments .
C :  Yeah , we just made a Word file
C :  with the basic
C :  elements .
C :  Uh the look-and-feel model . Uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . Simply a square with uh round corners . So that's basically it . Uh the material should be hard plastic .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh colour changeable , and also transparent . And colour and transparent , or just transparent , I don't know . Um then the elements .
C :  Uh we have
C :  The functions are just basic . Like uh I've pointed them here . Mute function , on-off function , text functions . This uh switch channel . And this is the
A :  Okay , cool .
C :  the num-pad . And the logo is over here , and the mic .
A :  Okay .
C :  And the scrollwheel , no ? You operate that with your pointing finger . So you hold it like this in your right hand and
D :  Means
A :  Mm .
A :  So how many functions do you need for for uh the microphone ?
B :  Speech recognition .
A :  Yeah , speech recognition . Just Only one button to say it's on or off .
B :  Um I didn't have a specification of that . But um I can imagine that you have to input your voice or something . Um so I've
C :  Uh I dunno .
C :  Yeah , maybe maybe uh you have to configure it .
B :  Yes , you need options to configure it , and after that you don't need 'em anymore .
A :  So you can put it on the back as well if you want to .
B :  Yeah , you can put 'em all on the back . That's for sure .
C :  Yeah , or or on the slide function , I don't know . Well we haven't had time to design that , the slide pad .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  That's uh
B :  We also don't know how many buttons are required , or what kind of buttons . But
B :  You have a lot of room if you can slide it open .
A :  Yeah , you can put it separate .
B :  You Yeah I know . I can imagine you need at least four buttons or something . So But it's enough room .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Um the position ? Yeah , you write uh You wrote this , so .
B :  Uh well Well the main , the main zap buttons are most central .
B :  That was the the most important thing . So uh the best place , the best reach place Um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find .
B :  Um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . That way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's
B :  will uh will show up .
B :  Uh scrollwheel is on the left side . It's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as I know .
C :  Yeah . But it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . So y Because you can use your thumb then .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Just just one thing now . Um y you need to have more uh one two th You've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . But you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes .
B :  Okay yeah , they
C :  Mm yeah .
B :  Yeah okay . That's that's below that then . It's uh twelve buttons .
C :  Yeah , okay .
C :  just so you get that .
D :  Okay , but
D :  It's rather important .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah okay , just we just missed that . But um I'll just uh
B :  I'll get back to later . F the form well , we've taken that from the iPod , other popular technical device . So um should be popular .
B :  Um
B :  The f uh the buttons creating ? Uh if you
B :  That or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners .
A :  Okay .
B :  So that , you know , you get a bit round feeling .
B :  Um we'll use hard plastic . Since that allows us to use uh two D_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons .
B :  Colour changeable . Well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . We have decided uh in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it .
D :  Okay .
B :  And also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it .
A :  And do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? How do you want to implement that ? Just on the Maybe on the second level as well ?
B :  So when you pre
B :  Yeah .
B :  We're going to implement . Yeah . Mm just a little
D :  Ah .
C :  Yeah , these are just basic functions , so All the non-basic are in
A :  Okay , just draw draw the second level , because we need that as well .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Um
D :  Okay , there is one uh function I use uh daily , and it's not on the basic functions . It's uh to switch to uh uh your Scart . Play Station or uh D_V_D_ player . That function must be
C :  Okay , maybe we use this button for the
D :  Yeah , maybe Or you can uh i uh lay it uh beneath in the uh other uh functions .
B :  Yeah , I um To your video device .
A :  Yeah , as well . Just make make a Just just draw a second level one and say all options that are still left or something .
C :  Yeah .
C :  A second level ? Like a a new blank one or Or just here ? Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  No no , just on Down there . So uh
B :  Is i Ah okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And h how does the second level come out ? Uh it slides uh along ?
A :  Just uh if you s
B :  Um slides I think . It's
A :  Yeah , y Maybe , yeah .
D :  From from the uh beneath ?
A :  For the bottom .
B :  You can do it that it claps open , but I think that's not solid enough . If that breaks then you're screwed .
A :  No , you gotta slide it .
A :  Yeah , it's right .
B :  So it do doesn't even have to slide all the way open . Um
C :  So what do we need ?
B :  Uh i the the speech functions buttons .
C :  Yeah , just
D :  Menu ?
B :  Menu button .
B :  With uh maybe uh arrows .
B :  So you can uh
B :  scroll in the , navigate the menu .
B :  Um
C :  God damn it .
D :  Scart ?
B :  I think we can even put a We have one for the zero and one for the for the more digit uh channels . So you have one left for the Right , the video channel , Play Station , etcetera . That's used pretty often .
D :  Uh yeah .
D :  And so y you keep you keep one , you have one left . Yes .
C :  So this is the
D :  Yeah . It's a f basic uh
B :  If you have a Play Station , mm you use it every day .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Extern or something .
A :  You want to save that file as well ?
A :  The drawing ?
B :  That was it .
C :  So here are multiple speech buttons , I don't know how many .
B :  Uh
A :  Doesn't really matter . Just just uh
C :  I don't know the functions . Okay . What else ?
B :  It doesn't really matter . That's Yeah well we don't have any uh Hmm ? What else ? Uh menu buttons with arrows .
C :  What else ?
C :  Uh menu .
D :  Yeah , to navigate .
C :  Uh With arrows .
B :  S Just uh like Um I think it's best if we do .
B :  Mm where do we have
B :  Or there .
C :  Like a normal um
B :  Like on the normal uh Like this .
C :  Yeah , with in the middle um a menu button . Okay .
B :  The menu button , yes .
B :  Well we don't have any , anything on how many buttons speech requires . So you can't redesign it .
D :  Mm okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Maybe one button to switch the colour of your uh LEDs ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
D :  Uh and and you can hold it , you can hold it , and then the colours switch or mm multiple multiple buttons .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Just press it once , the colour should uh switch . Press again , the colour switch again maybe ?
D :  okay .
A :  Or we just make it three buttons , all the colours on it . Just red , yel uh red , green and
D :  Okay , yeah . Th Yeah . If we have enough place , uh then we can do that .
C :  Yeah , okay .
A :  That's that's very easy , yeah .
C :  We can put those here .
D :  Colour buttons . And then we choose green , uh blue and red or Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay . That's uh Um
C :  So did we miss anything ?
B :  Yeah , maybe some uh some text next to the scroll wheel , that it is volume .
D :  It
D :  Some text uh buttons .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but
B :  I just uh The volume logo .
A :  No , ma on on o on the on the
D :  there's one there's one text button I
C :  Oh wh Here ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Just make it
D :  There's one text button I prefer . That's the one uh that you use if you search for a page , uh like seven hundred , uh and it's counting from one hundred to two hundred , you will switch to your television and back to text . Do you do you Did you think of that ?
C :  Yeah , or th or the
B :  Yeah , we have that on the the text button .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yep .
C :  Yeah , but then you can switch back to normal telete teletext . You just switch it off and then
B :  Uh why not ?
A :  Yeah , just put it on those extra f extra function as well .
D :  Ex Yeah . Yeah .
B :  No Whoa
C :  Well w we thought of a text button . And if you press it again , you get the the the
B :  I think um Yeah , the three stages . Yes .
D :  The sta the state you
A :  Oh just three stages , you Yeah , that's okay .
C :  through view . Yeah , b but but if you're in the second stage , the third stage is switch teletext off . So you can switch back from second to w first .
D :  Yeah .
B :  No , it doesn't have to turn it off .
D :  No . Just remember where it was . It it doesn't uh uh clear the the page . If you if you turn teletext on , you you set the seven hundred , and you turn it off , then the next time you turn it on , it still stays on seven hundred ? But maybe it's not the way
B :  Just don't
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yes , that's to remember .
C :  Okay , okay .
A :  Yeah , but that's that's uh
B :  I dunno if
A :  That's a functionality for the television .
B :  Yeah , I think as well , but Uh yeah .
D :  Mm . That's maybe one thing we can discuss about .
C :  Yeah mm nee uh No , if i uh the remote can send like the the code for seven hundred , page seven hundred to the television . Th th th if you switch it on .
B :  Yeah , in thi the the remote control in the
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , but you have to search every time again . That's what what happening if you do it like that . But it's still the television that has to do that .
C :  Th i
B :  the chip .
B :  Yeah , that's true .
C :  Yeah , I dunno . Okay .
B :  So yeah . Um do we need to fix that or
D :  Mm most new T_V_s do uh collect all the pages .
A :  No , that's what the television does .
C :  Yeah , those memory functions .
D :  But uh not not every every television , so
C :  Yeah . Was uh this logo for uh volume ? Okay .
A :  Okay , it's cool .
A :  Yeah , that's fine .
C :  So that's it ?
A :  Is this prich pretty much it , yeah ?
D :  Yeah , I I thought about one thing . Uh the buttons ? Uh from which material are they now ?
C :  Mm . No no Yeah . Just hard plastic . So
B :  Just like your telephone , hard plastic .
D :  Okay . Because um if you use it a couple of years , some uh sometimes the numbers on the on the buttons are slide away , are uh And maybe we can write the numbers below or above ? Or shall we just turn it on on the buttons ?
A :  It's too expensive to make it from a different material anyway .
B :  I think just on the buttons . If you do it abo above or below , it takes uh more space .
C :  Uh I think just um
D :  Well yeah . That's too much place .
D :  Okay , just leave it . Just leave it .
C :  Yeah , but
B :  I don't think the space is worth it .
D :  Yeah , and i
C :  I think uh you have that problem more often with rubber buttons .
D :  The most time
D :  Yeah , with rubber buttons . Yeah , okay .
D :  Okay . Fine .
A :  Yeah ? Okay , cool .
A :  Mm mm mm mm mm .
A :  Yeah , I don't know what this means . But I think we just evela evaluated this one .
D :  Yeah , I made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . I d d d I don't think if it's right . That shall show it .
A :  Oh okay , you made some criteria . Okay , cool .
A :  Okay .
A :  You have some usability criteria or Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm . Uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . Uh
D :  Oh .
C :  In the bottom .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Look-and-feel ?
D :  Evaluation crit
C :  No , evaluation is
D :  Yeah , evaluation presentation .
D :  It's not in .
D :  Uh d it doesn't matter um It only had two pages or something .
D :  Um well I looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . The Italians uh , how they think about it . And
D :  The research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . I made some criteria , and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . We sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our
A :  Okay .
D :  um model . And this These are all I I I found , or I wrote down . And um we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven . Uh
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh I think uh if you have a kind of iPod idea . It quite beautiful . It's
D :  Yes . Yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the iPod or something . And fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff . The LEDs .
B :  Mm .
A :  We are actu We are the
A :  Flashy .
B :  Okay . Well I think we do If it's really uh , if you can if you can get the iPod look , then it's beautiful , I think .
D :  Yes . And and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ? The basic colours are black or green or yellow ? Or you haven't thought about
A :  But uh
C :  Yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste .
B :  Hmm ?
B :  Um basic colours , um yeah . Well you didn't say . Maybe um company colours ?
D :  Ho how do we make uh
A :  It's black .
B :  Black .
D :  Black and yellow . Can
B :  A bit a bit of yellow .
A :  Yeah , yellow light . Do we have yellow light ? No , not really , but it's possible . It's
B :  Not not not yellow , but just a bit of light yellow .
D :  Black white , maybe ?
B :  Like white , also ni or uh always nice .
C :  And what colours should the buttons be ?
D :  Uh
D :  Because um
A :  Yeah , different colours . This is
B :  Just um
A :  Oh , the same as th th the cover . But also th the light behind it .
C :  But can you change those too , with uh the switch ?
B :  Yes .
A :  No , no . Make them No , just make them black or grey or something .
B :  Yeah , grey . Just dark grey I think .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? Beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours .
B :  Well we have changeable fronts , so
D :  Changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful .
B :  So
A :  Yeah , just give it a one . It's okay . It's perfect . I think it's just what you want . Or not ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's hard to decide for us , but yeah .
C :  Yeah . It's ju so subjective .
B :  It it's At least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , just give it a two .
D :  A two . Okay .
D :  The fancy look-and-feel . That's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . Okay . And we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy I think . So
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  One more thing . Are w are we changing uh Or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? Or n no back light ? Yeah ?
D :  Slide panel ?
B :  Mm . Not needed .
A :  No . No , it's only on the number , behind the numbers and uh
B :  Yeah , not needed I think .
C :  And and the switch channel is uh There is a back light too ?
D :  Oh , you mean th this here ?
A :  That as well , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but that's unnecessary .
B :  What do I think is necessary necessary item ?
D :  It's pretty cool . If you slide it open , it lights up . That's that's really fancy , but I don't know if it's reachable .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Of course it's reachable .
A :  It doesn't make
D :  Then we do it .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up . So you can see what's really there . Not just not re on the buttons or something . Just a green light or some blue light .
A :  No . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but
B :  To light it all up .
A :  But Yeah . Mayb Okay .
C :  Yeah , just backlight . Not not the buttons . And th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . So the buttons are just grey .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Well yeah . Uh semi-transparent .
A :  Yeah , just only Yeah , that's right .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay , fine . So I I think it's very fancy . So I'll give it a
A :  So
A :  Yeah , that's how I think .
B :  Yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so
D :  Yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so
A :  Yeah , this It is a one . It's okay . It's cool .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I think it's one .
D :  Okay , next . Learnable ? Easy to use ?
A :  This is a difficult one , because we we don't Yeah , we don't know it about the
D :  Yeah , we shall test it But uh
A :  Uh it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . It's That's
B :  Yeah .
C :  No , but you don't have to use that . And you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . That's th that's the main thing that's so good about it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  No .
B :  So I think it's easy to use , but And learnable is a bit
D :  Learnable ? It's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . Because because I think I think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . I think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or Uh then the re
C :  Well , I think it is .
B :  Well y just uh f
A :  But the rest of it is very easy , because there are so so n
B :  Yeah , I think it's very clear what it all does .
C :  So so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function .
B :  Yes .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  But the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn .
A :  So it is learnable um f i i In the first place it's very easy to use . And I think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device .
D :  Okay .
D :  But
B :  It's Yeah it's
D :  Yeah . But we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? And maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . So we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . You must slide it .
B :  Device .
D :  And that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls . 'Cause I think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use . Because easy to use comes after learnable . I I think it a three or something .
A :  But yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay , just Easy to use is very cool , so just give it a two .
B :  Maybe three then . Learnable's
A :  No , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah .
C :  Mm uh .
C :  The normal . And the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know
B :  Yeah okay . Yeah .
B :  Yep , true .
B :  Then a two .
D :  Oh . Okay . New features . Techno technological innovative ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  The speech function and the colour . Colour .
D :  The speech function is new . The scrollwheel and the slide . Uh I think the slide is pretty new .
B :  And the scrollwheel , backlights , slide .
A :  Slide is not n is is not new . No . I already have a
D :  Uh I only saw it in a telephone , not in an remote control .
A :  Uh I already have a V_C_R_ and it's about from nineteen eighty eight . And they all have a slide in it . So that's not new . Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  But also slide that buttons come out , as well ? Okay .
D :  Okay , and the the the lightning ? Is that new ? The lighting's new . Scrollwheel . Speech ?
A :  That's cool . Yeah for a Uh for a f
C :  Mm it's pretty new , I think .
B :  Yes .
C :  Speech is new .
B :  Different colours , so
D :  Yeah , different fronts for a remote control , I think that's new too .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  So we have a pretty new uh
A :  There are no games on it , that's that's It's not a one , it's a two again . But
B :  That would And we didn't uh
D :  It's it's it's not not L_C_D_ or something .
B :  But then we also have the the home station . We are forgetting about that now , but
A :  If you have
A :  Yeah . Oh yeah , that's right . Rechargeable .
D :  Uh-oh .
D :  Home-station .
B :  We don't recharge .
C :  Yeah , we didn't draw that too , but
B :  But that's more like uh now .
A :  Yeah , just draw it afterwards .
C :  Yeah , that's just a normal th s simple thing .
B :  I don't know .
A :  If you Can you save it on the same , in the same map as the other ones ? In the the project uh map ?
B :  Uh
B :  Just save , save as ?
A :  Yeah . Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh save as ? No , that's not in the project .
C :  Well it's a already in the folder . L like number seven .
A :  Oh yeah , okay . Smart board . Yeah , but this one .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  This one is not yet in the Oh oh .
C :  I think it is .
B :  Yeah , it is .
C :  No , I think it is .
B :  Uh untitled ? Yeah , it doesn't matter . Save .
C :  Okay .
D :  Uh all the the seven , uh all the seven .
A :  But you still have to draw the resi the recharger . Okay . And new features , so we give it a two or also again a one ? No , I think i if you have games on it , then then you give you have a one . But not
D :  No , we are not extraordinary new or something . Tha tha that
A :  No , just so it's still a two .
C :  Mm two , I think .
A :  Targeted audience . Uh we are the targeted audience ? Do we like it ?
D :  No , we we we searched for uh um a young group , audience , beneath f forty . Yes .
A :  Yeah , but l younger than forty . So we we are exactly the targeted group .
D :  Yeah , but did we reach , um with our uh style , the targeted audience ? Th that's my question .
A :  I think so , yeah . You get the fancy things for younger people . And you get the the aesthetic things for older people . So you want
C :  Yeah .
C :  We've got a one for fancy look-and-feel , and that's what attracts the young audience . So
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Um the only point is that we don't uh have uh uh That's that's That's this question .
C :  think that's a two or a one .
C :  Yeah , but s it That's basically not not handy . And I don't thi I don't see
D :  Yeah , this . So we targeted it ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  But we didn't follow the latest trends .
C :  Yeah .
C :  No .
C :  Yeah , you could make a a front
B :  Mm . I think we followed the latest trends .
C :  a front that's that's like uh like a banana , or something .
D :  Tha these are the only latest uh trends I uh get on my computer .
B :  Oh right . Well uh fruit and vegetables , yeah . You can different front uh
A :  Yeah , you get different colours .
D :  Uh yeah , th So we had we uh have uh a fruit uh
A :  So
C :  Like a a f banana kind of front .
D :  Oh yeah . But spongy will never be .
C :  No .
D :  So we give ourself a three or something .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Oh .
D :  Okay .
A :  So that's eleven .
D :  That's uh
D :  What's the average ?
A :  It's Yeah , it is one point eight three .
C :  Eleven divided by six .
D :  A perfect score . No , I don't know .
C :  We're not too hard on ourselves .
B :  This is a a power indicator . So you can see how far it's charged up .
C :  Okay .
D :  And and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep .
C :  Okay .
B :  To call . Um
A :  Oh yeah , that's still
D :  Call
C :  Yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . If you want to make it beep .
A :  Yeah , maybe we have to skip that one .
B :  Okay .
D :  That's Yeah , but it
B :  No no , I want that in .
C :  But we can we can do it uh underneath the logo .
D :  No , we need that . That's usable . That's really usable .
C :  If you do uh
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , right ?
C :  Yeah , okay .
D :  It's uh
A :  So I just got a financial um
B :  Yes uh .
A :  You s saved it or
D :  Yeah .
D :  I did save it .
A :  No .
A :  Okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . If I forgot anything , just say it to me .
A :  It just is a battery . Yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . But okay . So I think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three Euros .
C :  Mm okay .
D :  That's fine .
C :  But uh is uh uh
A :  So this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker .
C :  Okay .
A :  So that's both .
D :  Come on , it's perfect . Uh twelve point three point three .
A :  Yeah , and single curved curved .
C :  But but is it inc Does it include a a homestation or
A :  No , that's not on the list . But that shouldn't be .
C :  Can we make that for uh h twenty cents ?
B :  Yeah , we can uh
A :  Probably . I just The b the button supplements , I didn't I d I was wondering if this special colour maybe was I'm not sure .
B :  Um different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah .
A :  See it's I think it's okay like this .
D :  Special form , yeah .
A :  It's hard to say . But maybe we have to um Yeah , okay . Special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . We get different ones , that's all .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So you can put a recharger in it as well . But this is expensive , the sample speaker .
C :  Yeah .
B :  This ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's four .
D :  Four . It's four Euros .
B :  Oh , them . Is that uh included ? In the twelve Euro or Okay , then we then we need to use it .
D :  Yeah . So we are
A :  Yeah , that's included .
C :  It's kind of weird that we we get this information now , afterwards . Because
A :  Yeah , no . Okay , so this is uh pretty much it this .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Damn , solar cells are uh expensive .
A :  So I just want you Yeah , we just made it . So we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh
A :  for everything together .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  We can do some discussion about this . Was there room for creativity ?
C :  Sure .
D :  Yes .
B :  Okay .
A :  Paul , was there room for crea creativity ?
C :  Beautiful .
B :  Mm uh i Yeah , I think so . I think uh everyone uh already . So
C :  Yeah m If we got a high mark for um
C :  uh innovativeness or innovativity
A :  Yeah .
D :  Or a different style .
C :  then there we probably have been creative .
B :  I think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . So
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  We could make a lot of different uh remote controls . So it's creativity .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Huh .
A :  Okay , so the leadership
A :  Was there a leadership and
B :  Of course there was .
A :  Okay .
A :  What do you have to say about that ?
C :  No , I think Yeah .
D :  Who was the leader ?
A :  I dunno .
C :  Just normal discussion , I think . Not
B :  Yeah .
C :  one leader or something .
B :  One leader to
B :  check the time , etcetera .
C :  Yeah . And make notes .
A :  Yeah , I know .
B :  So more like a secretary .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , next one . Uh team work um The the third meeting I think that one was pretty hard . We were not all We were not um agree with every not agree with . We're not finished .
D :  Yeah yeah . We were not finished .
C :  Yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just
D :  Uh .
B :  Uh I think we we got wrong information at the wrong time . I think that was the m biggest problem . Like uh the prices . If we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , th that's weird .
D :  Yeah , because
D :  the prices uh could be twenty Euros or something now . And then
B :  Yeah , and if you had uh fifteen Euros , then we would it . We had to
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm hmm yeah .
A :  Yeah , finance .
C :  So we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right .
B :  Yeah .
A :  But the teamwork was okay .
D :  Yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . And uh
B :  I think uh everyone listen to each other . Like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Yeah , what I have to say about uh means . The smart board is okay . Digital pen is horrible . I dunno if you use it . But if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . No .
D :  Yeah .
B :  It was Just doesn't work . Well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . Just not work too slow . Yeah , more accurate .
D :  Digital pen or
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great .
D :  Yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , I think .
B :  Yeah , it's i It should be more accurate .
D :  Precise .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And uh I think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Not just pointing out on it .
A :  It's the same for the presenta for the presentations . You can do it from here . That's much easier than standing there . And so you've
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , and p just point with a mouse .
B :  No use to draw on the board itself . It's just slows down .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . But you might as well do it in normal computer style .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , like .
B :  Yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  And it's far too slow this way .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  You cou You could draw on it , but not as main function .
C :  No .
A :  I think Yeah , okay .
D :  Digital pen .
A :  So we made it in time . And we made a remote control .
B :  We did it .
A :  In the budget , yeah .
B :  New ideas found .
D :  New ideas .
C :  What's that ?
B :  Oh
D :  For for for
A :  I don't know what it mean . Just
B :  I just think if we uh
D :  To gather , or to uh
D :  work together , uh or new ideas for
B :  I dunno .
A :  For remote control probably . No , for the project .
B :  For remote control , a favourite for your text .
C :  Hmm .
D :  No , for the prototype . New ideas .
C :  Yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . Because we don't have any sizes and
A :  Yeah . But it's for the next team . We don't have to do that .
C :  Yeah , but it You can't possibly do that in such a short time , I think .
B :  That's for .
B :  Yeah , this this is just the idea phase , the
C :  Yeah , just brainstorming basically .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Details uh
D : 
C :  So are we finished ?
D :  Hmm .
A :  Yes , I think just I just write a final report .
C :  Okay . Yeah .
B :  Quite early .
A :  No , we have only
A :  four minutes left . Uh it's okay .
C :  Oh okay .
B :  Oh , what do we have to do now . Do we uh
B :  I thought we were done at four o'clock ?
C :  It's now quarter past three . So
B :  Yep .
D :  I should take some pictures uh .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm we can do it afterwards , so
D :  Yes .
D :  Let's play minesweeper .
B :  Yeah . I found it as well .
D :  Ti-din ti-din .
B :  One two three
B :  four five six seven cameras .
B :  Mm not bad .
B :  So that was it .
C :  Yeah . Now we can look at this .
B :  This is
C :  We're probably not supposed to look at this , but
B :  The old versions .
C :  Yeah , from the previous group .
B :  They went for uh
B :  for a universal device . Yeah , but also a different device .
C :  The touchscreen , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Then an L_C_D_ uh would be handy .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Here are the
C :  basic functions in here , the selecting dev devices .
B :  Yeah , and touch screens for all our stuff , yeah . I do agree with that .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah , tu-dum .
B :  English is not so hard by the way .
C :  No .
D :  I'm breaking a world record here .
B :  Well , leader ?
D :  Oh shit .
B :  Project Manager ?
D :  We've got a problem , Paul .
B :  You do ? Yeah , you have to make a choice .
D :  Yes .
D :  No it's your choice .
B :  Wow , that's pretty quick .
D :  Tu-dum .
B :  Uh uh um
D :  Just pick one .
B :  You have to decide .
B :  It's the lower one .
D :  What's this ? A bomb or not a bo This the bomb ?
B :  No no , the upper one is the bomb . Yes .
D :  Wrong .
D :  Shit . I knew it .
B :  I knew it .
D :  Four in a row .
B :  No . That's too much work .
D :  Uh .
B :  Come on .
D :  Is that previous work ?
C :  Yeah , this one .
B :  I challenge you .
D :  Oh , that's so stupid .
D :  No , that doesn't work .
B :  No , you gotta use the magic pen .
B :  Hmm .
B :  What if
B :  I put one
B :  there ?
D :  That's stupid .
B :  We'll see .
D :  Okay .
B :  I don't agree .
D :  Mm .
D :  Sorry .
B :  Yeah , you had two choices .
B :  That's gonna be draw .
B :  Or not .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Too bad .
B :  I'll put it here . You are going to put it there . Then
D :  Yeah , then I put it there . No one wins .
B :  It's a difficult choice , either here or there .
C :  This is a very interesting design .
B :  Ugly .
D :  It's just the same as normal .
C :  Well it has a L_C_D_ , I think .
B :  Oh a pen .
B :  Yeah , but
D :  Okay .
B :  Then do it correctly .
D :  Stupid design . Stupid .
C :  And what else do we have ?
B :  Stupid , the L_C_D_ screen .
D :  'Kay wait , I'm going to draw something and you must y
B :  What ?
B :  Okay , I'm going to guess what you're drawing .
D :  Okay , blank .
B :  No no , the new one .
D :  Oh .
B :  Uh they just don't save it .
D :  Um
D :  I know uh .
B :  A house ?
B :  Yeah , you have to use the pen s stupid .
A :  You have to save everything , you know that , huh ?
B :  No , not everything .
D :  Oh .
C :  Yeah , everything .
B :  Pen , select select pen .
D :  Pen .
C :  It wants to know what we do in our spare time .
B :  Okay .
B :  It's a house .
B :  A plant ?
D :  No , it's Only you can know it .
B :  Oh yeah , I can know it .
B :  It's a
D :  It's uh very hard to draw .
B :  Okay , that makes it easier .
B :  I think I know . No , wrong .
D :  Mm .
B :  I think I know what you're trying to draw , but it's wrong already .
D :  It's very
B :  Yeah , you missed the right side .
D :  Fuck . F
B :  No , you're wrong , you're wrong
D :  A little bit maybe , but
B :  See where you're wrong now ?
B :  The entrance .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Warning . Finish meeting now .
B :  Alright .
D :  Okay , the entrance is uh more to the left .
C :  Warning . Warning .
B :  You're correct .
D :  Okay . But but but I think this part
B :  Yeah , but I think Oh no you made another mistake .
D :  Oh . Yeah , there are a lot of mistakes , because the walls are thick like this .
B :  No I w Okay , I'm not that whiny . But uh there was a big hole here as well , and there as well .
D :  Oh , that's true . Uh here . Yeah , they're walking behind the walls .
B :  That's a kinda big mistake .
B :  Warning , finish meeting now .
B :  Guys , I think we have to finish the meeting .
C :  Okay .
D :  'Kay this is a hard one .
B :  Uh ?
C :  Boom-boa-ring-bing .
B :  What does it say ?
C :  Fill in the questionnaire .
C :  What now ?
B :  Come on .
A :  Okay , yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yep .
D :  Okay .
C :  No more chit-chat .
B :  Oh you gotta finish
D :  Che-che-che-che .
B :  over there ? In your own room ? I'm gonna be so lonely .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Tu-dumm .
D :  Uh .
B :  Mm I'll clean that up later .
D :  This is That's my new interface .
B :  What's that ?
D :  That's a uh edited smiley .
D : 
D :  Tom-ti-dom . Uh .
C :  Okay .
A :  Good .
C :  Beep .
C :  Oh .
B :  What ?
A :  So well uh welcome everyone . Um as you may have noticed I uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  created separate folders because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . I don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , which is for now the detailed design meeting .
B :  Yeah .
D :  That's new one ?
B :  We didn't make any uh
A :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , we should save that one .
B :  Oh in
A :  Then I'll move this one .
B :  Didn't we just do that ?
C :  Yeah , save in the folder . Save as project .
B :  Oh .
A :  Oh no , this is just one big document , so you can leave that wherever it is . And we have a evaluation left here . Okay .
C :  Oh , okay .
C :  Hmm hmm .
C :  Agenda .
A :  Well not main documents this time . Oh uh yes . I have it open myself I guess . Um well the detailed design meeting Huh ?
B :  Hmm ?
A :  We're finally getting somewhere hopefully . Um what are we going to do ? I've opened it already . Um I'm still going to take some minutes , and if I'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ?
C :  Oh , sorry .
B :  We could .
A :  Aren't you ? Yes , you are . And uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? Good . And we have a correct agenda . And uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , how did we work together and what are the results , and how happy are we with those . Okay , well finance uh will be later . Now I'd like to give the word to you two .
C : 
D :  Yep . Yep .
B :  Oops .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Get up stand up . just 'Kay .
B :  Well uh we made a prototype . We first start with the overall uh
C :  View .
B :  This is about the total remote control . We made it green .
C :  Just example colour , so uh there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype .
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's a fresh colour . And uh the screen light blue .
B :  Oh uh this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . And the R_ and R_ logo , it just says R_ and R_ now , but uh
C :  Okay ?
B :  Any questions so far ?
D :  Big microphone .
C :  yeah , just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Oh okay .
D :  That's the place where it's going to be , not the size .
C :  Uh well , it's an idea in a so .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Oh y you perhaps you should make it a bit big , so people know it's there and uh
C :  Do not forget it .
B :  Uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  To function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course . The microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . Okay um
D :  Yeah , okay . Of course .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Mm . Mm , th yeah .
D :  Small .
C :  we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . Uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh I uh um
B :  You push the scroll button and it's claps out if there's a
C :  Yeah , you push the scroll button
C :  and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . For example uh T_V_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera . So uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , uh as you can see oh , it's here , just push it in , uh the menu comes out like this and uh i it all becomes visible . Um
B :  Remote settings , et cetera .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . And you could also touch it so that it comes out , and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers .
C :  Yeah , that's c Yeah .
C :  Indeed .
B :  Yes .
C :  Okay , um it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , and the opportunity to use the teletext , whi which is used uh which should still be used and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh Yes .
C :  In an apart uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  So a separate button for for text , okay .
C :  In a separate button , yeah .
B :  Yeah . Perhaps we should use the teletext sign in p yeah .
C :  A sign , yeah , just like Okay , indeed . Okay , we can uh modify that later . Okay . Would you like to make any comments about next uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Forgot .
B :  Uh well , this is the total interface uh that f of the L_C_D_ screen . Uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . We put ano an an extra button in . We can erase it , but It's the button where you can switch channels . just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . Yeah , that one , yeah . It has a name . And uh uh we put that in , I thought it would be handy there . Uh this the one number or two numbers button . Below that , the page and the sound . And uh in the middle the the mute .
C :  Previous page , yeah , indeed .
C :  Oh my God .
B :  Uh battery indicator . It's it's a bit big . And this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop .
C :  It's quite large .
B :  Or at least it should look like it . And the options uh of teletext .
C :  Okay . You can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen , so it's very uh when you uh when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . 'Cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu .
B :  Huh .
C :  'Cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down , so
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . Well this about it , I think .
C :  Okay . Huh .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Thank you . Looks good .
B :  I will put it back on the on the nice green .
A :  And I just missed when I was typing The R_R_ stands for ?
B :  That's the logo of the Yeah . It's th th right now it's only R_ R_ , but uh
A :  Logo , okay . Okay well
C :  Full screen .
A :  I would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course .
D :  Shit .
B :  Yeah . Sorry .
C :  Alright .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Okay , the evaluation criteria , huh ?
B :  Oh full screen , yeah .
C :  Huh .
D :  Evaluation .
D :  'Kay , my task was this time to put up a questionnaire
D :  by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . My name , my job , okay . The methods .
C :  My name , my job .
D :  Questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps .
B :  Right .
D :  One means absolutely not true , seven means true .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are , is the remote control fancy enough ,
C :  Sorry , you used the PowerPoint
B :  Yeah .
D :  is it in innovative enough , and is it easy enough to use .
D :  And then evaluation itself .
D :  Uh .
C :  What ? Bling .
D :  So .
D :  Okay . First question . Is the design fancy enough ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well
D :  Project Manager , what do you think ?
A :  Well it's looks fancy , especially with the green colour . And the the curves which we decided , huh ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  But does it
D :  Yeah .
A :  Only what happened to the single curve
A :  we spoke about last meeting ?
C :  Now uh the single curved idea was uh
B :  It uh oh it's in the background . Oh .
C :  Yeah , okay , you ge um
B :  Y you should make uh a sideways uh view .
C :  Yeah . The sideways view , uh that that that ma
B :  It will be , I guess . Oh , we can
C :  Ho not that pen . Not that pen .
B :  Oh g I would smart board . Uh can I draw here or uh
D : 
A :  Well it might work one time , huh .
C :  Suppose so .
D :  Think .
B :  Ooh .
D :  Yeah , yeah , you can .
C :  Ah . Oh my God , it works .
B :  So it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , right ?
C :  Yeah , that's the single curve indeed .
B :  Yeah .
B :  So if you v flip it like this .
C :  Yep .
A :  Okay .
B :  Here's yeah .
C :  That's not very i it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . Uh make it uh rather thick on the top , because uh on the top it has uh the screen , which takes uh in some uh space , and the batteries can be located over there , so uh
B :  Yeah . So you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , so that it lays a bit o
C :  Yeah .
D :  Isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ?
B :  Yeah , that's a bit of problem maybe .
C :  No .
D :  With two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot I think
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think yeah , the battery should be in here , because it's just nothing , so if you could
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , indeed . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . 'Cause otherwise I think i
A :  Okay , but we have to rate uh these things now ? Okay .
D :  Yeah , we have to rate . Is it fancy enough ? True is one , false is seven .
D :  So fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people .
B :  I think it does . I if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it .
C :  I think so . It's pretty fancy .
D :  I think
D :  Yeah , I have to agree , all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , it's only design .
C :  you get th
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I think it does .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And the design .
A :  Well I think uh especially because of the microphone and the L_C_D_ screen also .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . I don't know whether older people will use it , but
A :  Very new thing . Well
D :  So
A :  Fancy the old people will .
B :  I would make it a two or something .
D :  A two ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  It's true , it's a one . Very fancy .
B :  Huh ?
B :  Alright , it's a one . Oh it's a one .
A :  No , it's a two . Little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , huh ?
D :  Yeah , I n used I wouldn I should use that one , but it doesn't
B :  Yeah .
B :  But it's a one uh Maybe uh
D :  Okay , no it's two ? True is a one . Very true , is it very true or isn't that true ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Well I'd say two on a scale
B :  Well they think it's very true , but uh
C :  It's very true , because we designed it to be very fancy , so
D :  Yeah , I think two .
B :  Yeah , but
C :  It's very fancy , I think . Have you ever seen a remote control like this ?
B :  We should perhaps
A :  No , okay well , that's true .
C :  No , okay , so so it's fancy .
D :  That's fancy enough .
B :  That not .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Then ?
A :  Okay , one two . That doesn't matter that much , so make it a one .
D :  Okay . Let's give it a two . Is it innovative ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  I think it is , because it has an L_C_D_ screen , a mi microphone .
D :  Enough .
A :  Yeah m
C :  And uh uh the scroll is rubber , so s
D :  We have for the search function .
B :  It's from rubber . Yeah .
D :  The scroller a bit I think it's it's a one yeah .
C :  Eno enough to I think .
B :  It's a one I think .
D :  True .
D :  Also huh uh-huh the buttons , are they easy to find ? That was a big requirement of the old people .
B :  Yeah , because they're right on your screen .
B :  So you can use the b the the arrows .
C :  Huh .
B :  They're right on your screen , so I don't know where you'd search . Yeah .
C :  With the ones
D :  Are all the buttons easy to find ? Not only this buttons , all the buttons .
B :  Well , I think they are .
B :  The options are it uh little bit harder , but if you touch the options then it's uh
C :  Yeah .
C :  Take a harder look , yeah , sure .
D :  I think th it's
C :  It's easier than the regular uh remote control .
D :  easy t
D :  Yeah , I think this is easy now . I think th I think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to
A :  Yeah , and you use these buttons the most , huh ? So
C :  Yeah .
B :  No they're not , but they're they're they are easy to find .
D :  to handle .
D :  True .
D :  I would rate it a
C :  Yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button . So you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most Yeah .
B :  Oh .
D :  Yeah , okay , that's true , that's true .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So which
D :  But that's that's vantage of L_C_D_ screen , you can have text .
A :  So which number are we going to fill in ?
C :  I think it's uh it's a two , at least .
B :  I would say yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , you can make it a two .
A :  A two , yeah ? Two , three and what do you think ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  It's not perfect , but
D :  I think it's a three .
C :  A three ? And why is that ?
A :  Okay , so we have two , two , three .
D :  I personally think , because I d I don't think i maybe it's easy to use , it has to be easy to find right away . I I think if you have the button at the right , I don't think you can find the option button that easy .
B :  Yeah , but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . You can touch it . Yeah .
D :  You can touch it .
C :  It said bo both the options .
B :  You you can touch options .
D :  Yeah , okay , but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , right ? Okay , then okay , good . Then I think also two , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  You can touch options and it's comes out .
A :  A two , okay , because we have to
D :  Yep .
C :  A two , a two .
B :  The uh the um Below .
A :  It's the box below it , huh ?
C :  Uh the next question the next question . Oh my God .
A :  Otherwise we have two results in one question .
B :  It's different .
A :  Okay , next question .
D :  It's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people .
B :  For young people I think it's easy to use .
D :  Young means sixteen to forty years . And elderly from forty eight to their death .
C :  Yeah , I was uh Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think it's
C :  I think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . Yeah , but because it has the regular uh controls , li uh as you can see in the screen now , and uh
B :  In the entire mankind .
A :  Okay , you're very enthusiastic about your own design , huh ?
D :  Also if you're sixty years old
C :  you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen . So it's t I think it's really easy to use . You want these options to
B :  Yeah .
A :  As well for the for the older people ?
D :  Yeah , as well as your if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand
C :  Uh sure .
B :  Yeah , but uh
B :  Yeah , but they they don't want the uh extra options , right ? So
D :  No , but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , so it it it has to be
A :  And would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ?
B :  Yeah , okay , but so they could
B :  Uh I think it is . If they read a manual .
A :  Because that might Yeah . Okay , well
D :  If you read the manual , always .
C :  Perhaps that is one of the most uh
B :  Yeah , alright .
B :  Because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult . You say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , then you say the question and the answer . And that's everything it does , the speech recognition .
A :  M maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use .
C :  Uh because a lot of
C :  Channel one , channel four , yeah .
A :  Yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I think it would make it uh
C :  Yeah , I think it does . Because all the people who can't uh
D :  So
B :  I would make it two .
D :  Also two ? Not a seven for this ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh a two . Sure , two . Oh .
B :  Three ?
A :  I'd say three .
D :  I would also say three .
C : 
B :  Oh . You ?
A :  Okay , so we have three three two two or
C :  Two .
B :  Oh . Well
A :  So what are we going to do ? Okay , a three , I see . Uh
B :  Two and a half . Three ? No .
C :  Give me more .
A :  Another question .
D :  Remotes overwhelmed with buttons .
B :  No .
C :  No .
A :  No .
D :  No , that that's that's yeah . Tha that's a one , I think , that's definitely a one .
B :  But um I mean , that's definitely one .
C :  That's definitely our uh
B :  Oh nee , oh seven is it ? It is . Yeah , uh the remote score .
D :  No ? Oh yeah .
C :  A false , yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , but I think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results , so
D :  Yeah , I think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed .
B :  It's not overwhelmed .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , indeed .
D :  True .
A :  Okay , a one , because we designed for that , huh ?
B :  Yep .
D :  Remote control has uh colours that different that meet different target groups .
B :  Yes .
C : 
B :  'Cause we make them in different colours , so that they uh
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , is optional .
A :  Yeah .
D :  That's true .
A :  Yeah , and I though w we had about single colours , but you can also make uh a wood colour , not just one single colour but a wood-like thing , can't you ?
B :  Yeah . That it that it looks like wood , like something , yeah . Uh I think you can .
C :  Huh .
D :  Also with rubber ?
A :  Whether it looks like wood , it isn't w it isn't wood but
D :  Yeah , okay .
B :  It it feels like rubber , but
A :  You can make a print on rubber , can't you ? Yeah . So that's a one then , huh ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah ?
B :  Well but then when you scratch it it does come off .
D :  That's a one ? Okay .
C :  Yeah , it is it is harder to
B :  So that's a bit
A :  Do you have many questions ?
D :  Uh I have
C :  to like
A :  Oh , okay well
B :  Oh we have time .
C :  Geez .
A :  Yeah , but we have We also We have to get to the money .
C :  We're getting paid . We're getting paid .
D :  The material used is spongy , that that's uh that's a one , that's m rubber .
B :  What ?
A :  What spongy .
B :  Yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . Oh but not it's not very spongy , because it's hard rubber .
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah , I th think it's not the most spongy thing .
B :  I think it's a three .
C :  Yeah , it's a three , because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible , because it has a L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh-huh , yeah .
B :  Hard but
B :  Yeah . You can break it . Yeah .
D :  Remote control is hard to lose .
C :  Hard to lose , yeah it sh and it's easy to find .
B :  Y yeah , you could you could call it .
D :  Y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . If first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it .
B :  Yeah , y you can lose it , but it isn't hard to lose .
D :  It isn't hard , no . I think I think this is a two , personally .
B :  Two . That it's hard to lose ? Yeah , it it is there's the it's a six , you think ?
D :  No .
C :  Isn't hard to lose .
A :  Yeah , so isn't hard to lose you .
C :  Isn't hard to lose , yeah .
D :  Isn't hard to lose .
B :  So it's a two . Yeah , you can lose it , so I don't you can make it a three I
D :  Yeah .
D :  You can't lose it .
B :  It does have an a built in function .
D :  Or if you're you're sixty years old , your demands
A :  Yeah , but a har
A :  A hard to lose is good . So it should this question should be hard to lose . It's difficult to lose it .
B :  Nee .
B :  Hard to lose . Oh right .
C :  Yeah , this this is hard to lose .
B :  It is hard to lose . Yeah , so then this is it is almost true , so a two .
C :  This
A :  A two .
D :  I think yeah , I think also .
A :  A two .
C :  Two , yeah .
A :  Okay .
B : 
C :  And most all because of the option to Whoa .
D :  Huh ?
B :  Ooh .
A :  Yeah , it's okay . That happens above also . But maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal , but
B :  Oh .
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah ? Oh , okay .
A :  Yep . Oh , it isn't , well okay . Remember .
D :  No .
B :  Oh well , it doesn't .
C :  put the cor cursor on the .
D :  Okay okay okay . Remote control mainly be sold to younger people .
C :  Click .
C :  True .
B :  I think it will , yeah .
D :  Yeah ? True ?
C :  True .
D :  Very true ?
C :  Uh yeah . Uh
B :  Uh well I a a two .
D :  No , I don't think very true because the colours .
A :  There .
D :  We have the colours . Um we have the buttons is aren't that that much .
C :  Materials , yeah .
D :  Nah , the material isn't that
B :  It's it's much more younger .
C :  Uh okay . So ma uh make it make it a two .
D :  So I don I think I think it's a three .
A :  Well I think it's it's uh a lower number , so better because w we designed it for young people especially , didn't we ?
B :  Yeah . I think it's a two but
D :  Yeah , but I uh
D :  Okay , okay . I think because yeah ?
A :  What do you think ?
A :  Questions ?
C :  A two ? I think it's two . I think it's two too , two too too .
A :  Two .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  Two two two . Let's make everything a two .
D :  In the features ?
A :  Dissatisfy younger people . Um
B :  Younger people . It has
C :  Well perhaps not .
B :  What did
D :  Because younger peoples are cr critical and they wanted a lot of features on this thing .
B :  Yeah . Well that it doesn't .
C :  Well , n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , but it's for a remote control I think it i it would satisfy those needs . Yeah , the speech possibility , the colours .
B :  Yeah bu but
B :  I think they like the speech .
B :  You could call to your uh yeah , and the screen , yeah .
D :  L_C_D_ screen and scroll .
C :  Scroll options , yeah .
D :  I I think they'll be quite met with their expectations .
A :  Yeah , but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something .
B :  Right , that that that those are features .
D :  No .
A :  It has relatively few features , with
D :  It's three features , basically , the L_C_D_ touch screen is feature .
C :  Yeah .
D :  The microphone is a feature .
B :  No , aren't the features the microphone's feature and that you can change the channel's feature , and that you can change the volume is feature , and that you can change the options of the remote , uh uh something like that . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Ours had other features with
D :  I think yeah , and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings .
C :  The easy volume up button .
B :  Those are features .
C :  Remote younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . Turn uh turn up the volume .
D :  Yeah yeah . So I've chos I shou I think it's it's it's a one .
B :  Enough features ?
D :  Personally , yeah . I think once you've 'cause you have the channel features b uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , the you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , L_C_D_ screen extra , scroll
D :  thing extra .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , you think one , what do you think ?
B :  I think two or three .
A :  You . three , yeah . I'd say three , so two it is then or
C :  Two .
B :  Yeah . Yeah uh a two a two . Just another two . We like two .
D :  Make it make it a two .
C :  One two three .
D :  Or make it uh a fucking two . You can see the remote control is R_ and R_ .
C :  Right .
B :  Yeah , there's R_ and R_ in front . Uh it's not the colour , so maybe you should make two , but it has R_ and R_ .
C :  Uh .
A :  Yeah . Yep .
D :  Has oh yeah , do did have nah y you have the black one . And we'll probably make also a yellow one .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but not R_ and R_ yellow I think .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , maybe maybe two . Well m th but the logo is on on the front , so a two , yeah , that's
D :  Maybe two .
C :  Okay , true , yeah .
B :  One d on i it's the colours and the
D :  X_ marks spot . And the menu is avail that is available is easy to use .
B :  I think it is , but I don't know what you think .
C :  I think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . Entirely explained .
D :  Yeah , tha that's so true .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , uh
B :  And you can navigate easier , because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal T_V_ uh remote .
C :  Yeah , you can navigate .
C :  Uh .
D :  I think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . No , I'm not not convinc . Let's go th for I think it would be a t yeah , two . Now lower .
C :  You're not satisfied , okay . Let's start over again then .
B :  Yeah . Let's make a different remote . Well
B :  Menu .
B :  A two ? We only have twos .
C :  A two .
A :  Oh , well that's that's pretty good , huh ?
C :  Oh yeah , I think so . Yeah .
B :  Uh just twos . One three and a few ones .
D :  So okay , we have one three , a one , that that have to got up .
C :  And three .
B :  Two threes .
D :  Two two two two two . So two , yeah . The average is a two . That is quite good
B :  We m mostly have twos , so it's pretty good .
B :  Yeah .
C :  The average .
B :  Yeah . I think so too .
D :  in my opinion .
C :  Yeah , I think so .
D :  That
B :  We can be happy .
D :  Ooh .
C :  Save .
D :  Ooh .
B :  Yeah . What is it ? It's like a bug or something . A fly , yeah .
C :  It's a fly .
C :  Oh m
B :  A f butterfly .
D :  Top .
B :  Yeah .
B :  That's it .
D :  Okay .
A :  That was your evaluation uh show , okay , so we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . Okay , good . Um let's see oh , it isn't asked to save but it did already
D :  Yes .
B :  Sure .
D :  No , it's two . The average is two .
B :  It's good . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Exactly .
D :  Yeah , I uh uh I uh saved it .
A :  And this
A :  Everything okay . Well , the next part uh might be a little bit
A :  difficult to do
A :  in a group , but I am willing to try it .
A :  Because we are going to look at the finance and I have a nice Excel sheet to do that .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Redesign . No .
A :  And um I'm not sure if I put it in the project folder . look on that . Um and we're going to calculate the production costs , and if they are uh under or at twelve Euro fifty ,
C : 
B :  Yeah .
A :  we're good , and if they're not we're going to uh re-design , but we have to do that uh very very quick I think , yes . Um I don't know if I
B :  Yeah .
B :  So we're going to erase features or something .
B :  Do you have the cost or uh
A :  put the Excel sheet in the
B :  Let's hope . We're going to be here at eight o'clock .
A :  n not in the
D :  f fifty five Euros .
A :  folder . I think it's
A :  I think it's still in my own documents folder .
B :  We're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock .
D :  No .
B :  I doubt it . Perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the Excel sheet .
A :  Oh shit .
D :  Yeah mm yeah , maybe .
A :  So
B :  No , it was in my uh my information , so uh
D :  The microphone . Yeah ? maybe you're going scrap scrap it .
C :  Yeah . It i It wasn't too much .
B :  Yeah .
C :  As well as the L_C_D_ screen . Whoa .
A :  Okay , well this is it . Um maybe I could ask one of you to uh fill it in , so that I can also uh take minutes , and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions .
B :  Well , if it doesn't work
B :  I want to fill it in , but uh
D :  No prob .
D :  Ah .
B :  But you should uh direct
D :  Count it ? Li like write it be
A :  Well we have to count some things and we have to think about some things . But you have to fill in this column , huh ? No , uh count uh number of functions , because for every button you have to pay and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens , so
C :  Count it . You got Excel to count .
B :  The number of
C :  Oh okay . Well I dra uh Danny , Danny , I'll do that , because I draw the uh
D :  Ah , okay , cool . Huh ? Yeah ? Oh , yea yeah , you design it . Um
B :  We've got a battery , one or t two batteries , or not ? nee one battery , with two small batteries .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but it's it's more about the energy source , huh ? Do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ?
B :  Yeah . I would do a battery we do . Right ? A battery . One battery , right ?
D :  Solar cell . No it took a battery ?
A :  We'll wait .
C :  No , no solar cell , no no no no .
A :  Yeah .
C :  No hand dynamo . Hand
D :  Yeah .
B :  Electronics , simple chip advanced chip , right ?
D :  We have
D :  No , we have sample speaker . But b al but we also have sample speaker , do
C :  On advanced chip .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah , so this one and this one .
B :  Uh we ha we have um single what ? Are we ? Oh yay .
D :  Oh , we already on nine .
D :  We have double curved .
C :  Single nee single curved . Double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . But it isn't three dimensional , it isn't curved in a l
B :  The single .
D :  Single .
D :  This one is
B :  Oh the the it's not going to work uh people . We have rubber .
D :  This one is curved like this , right . It's curved like this .
A :  I'll just fill it in .
C :  No no no , single curved is like this . Uh that's the only curve you made , not th uh curved like that . That's uh
A :  Um rubber indeed ?
D :  Yeah , bu what
D :  Oh , but we have curves like it and it . There are two curves , right ? Oh , okay I understand , I understand . Rubber .
B :  Thirteen ?
C :  Huh ?
B :  With a scroll wheel , right ? Is he integrated ? No , eh ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  I don't know .
D :  Push button . No , we don't have push button .
C :  Yeah , we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s
B :  Oh yeah , right , we want it to it's not it's not no . Yep . Fifteen , oh , too bad .
D :  L_C_D_ display .
C :  Not going to work ? Okay .
C :  Okay um
B :  Oh but with special colour we have . A special form , right ?
C :  But now button supplements . We don't got the button supplements .
B :  Oh , we don't have any buttons , so Yeah , we need to uh
D :  Eighteen and a half , damn . We have to lower it with six points .
C :  Damn .
C :  Okay .
B :  No , uh we have fifteen and oh , right .
D :  Twelve and half .
B :  We could lose the curve .
C :  Nah .
D :  We could use
B :  Yeah , I would lose the curve .
C :  We could lose the scroll wheel . You could make it just a regular scroll wheel .
B :  But you can't push it , so you have to tap .
C :  Yeah , if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button .
B :  Yeah , alright . So normal scroll wheel ?
A :  Yeah , I think that will be
A :  our best bet .
C :  Normal scroll wheel .
B :  And I think we should lose the curve .
D :  I think we should scrap the sample speaker . It's four pri it four units .
C :  Lose
B :  Yeah , but if you would i it is a new feature , it it's something special .
C :  Okay , so we don't exactly need the single We don't need a curve . 'S possible to lose curve .
D :  But w d wha
B :  No , the curve doesn't really
D :  Curved then it will be square .
B :  No , then it will won't uh stand up from the table . Then it would just
D :  Was that does that mean to it , single curve ?
C :  Okay . Yeah , that's meant with scr uh with s curve . The curve is uh in a dimension . If you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  So
B :  We would lose this one ?
D :  Yeah , but tha that that only is one .
B :  Yeah , we could s yeah , a bit .
C :  No , two .
D :  No , one .
B :  Sixteen point three .
C :  Oh , okay , indeed .
D :  So we don't Yeah , we also have to
B :  So we still
C :  Is it possible to make
B :  Could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ?
D :  No , otherwise we don't have an L_C_D_ screen .
B :  No ? Ma y you just can't do that , or uh
C :  No .
A :  And what did you change ? You changed the uh scroll wheel and
B :  We changed th
B :  Yeah , and the single curved to uncurved .
D :  Single curved . Flat .
A :  Oh , but it's just one
D :  Yeah , so that does doesn't doesn't that mu I think
A :  point , so maybe you should should uh
B :  No .
D :  Scrap sample speaker ? That that's uh
A :  Yeah , you should you should drop the speech recognition .
C :  The sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points .
B :  Yeah , but it's t
D :  Yes , four points .
B :  Yeah , but it is uh it it is a new feature , it is something special .
A :  And then you can keep the curve .
A :  Or can't you ?
C :  Yeah , uh becau uh when you lose the
D :  Yeah , but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? F You have to we have to scrap four points .
B :  I don't know . Yeah , that's difficult .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Or make it on a hand dynamo , but I don't think that will work .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Ma make it with wood instead of rubber ?
C :  No , that's no . Make it w uh when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ?
B :  Uh .
B :  We could make it titanium instead of rubber .
C :  You don't make a remote control of Ah .
D :  Yeah , it it i Yeah , it also uh it also takes one point less .
A :  Yeah , mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , yes ?
B :  Oh . Oh can I ask something ? What is special colour ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Is that the wood uh wood uh this , we have to have that one too ?
D :  I think it is .
C :  It isn't .
C :  What ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but it's only a half . But I think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker .
D :  Yeah . Sample speaker .
C :  To knock the sample speaker , yeah . And sample sensor .
B :  Th then we still have too much
D :  Yeah , okay , three . Point three .
B :  if we use the uh
C :  But m yeah , course , but What we'll have . Let's make it thirteen or fourteen .
B :  Yeah , we we scrap that one ?
D :  Huh ?
D :  Point twelve .
B :  See , a po three . We need point three .
D :  That's a scroll wheel .
B :  Uh it's a colour . Don't make it wood .
C :  A colour .
D :  Yeah , but a wood we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood .
B :  Make it uh
B :  Yeah , but it's it's special colour , is it
C :  Yeah , special colours , fruity colours .
B :  a all kind of colours ? It's also green or uh
D :  Is it also no that that's just normal colour fruit colours . Normal colours , yellow
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . You have to add something to the rubber to make it green . You don't say here's green rubber .
C :  Yeah .
C :  They don't sell green rubber plants . Alright .
D :  Yeah , but then I d I don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half .
B :  Yeah , you can , you should you have to lose
D :  But then we have to scrap L_C_D_ display , we have to scrap uh
B :  No , it is the scroll wheel , I guess .
C :  No no no .
D :  s advanced chip .
D :  No then we have to scrap everything we got because how many colours we gonna make ? Five ? Then we have two .
C :  If we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen
D :  S touch .
B :  A push , yeah .
C :  then it's possible to make . And then you can and then you can add to the colours .
D :  Then we can make add two colours on it . Yeah , two colours it .
C :  Special c Okay , if you lose uh if you lose the
B :  Switch colours .
B :  It was such a great idea .
C :  You lose this one , you got eleven point five and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example .
D :  They can add two colours .
D :  But the colours . Um how ma uh the colours like l she told ,
D :  is that all the colours we add or
C :  How d uh uh how many colours ? Special colours , all the colours you want , because you want to make p
B :  What do you mean ?
D :  Yeah , but we we we are we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium .
C :  Yeah , but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour .
B :  Oh . But I think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , 'cause you have to add it .
D :  Ah okay .
C :  I suppose .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but the rubbers alls original black .
B :  Yeah , so you always lose the special colour . You co you could make it always black , like normal remote .
D :  Yeah b
D :  Yeah , but we're gonna make it yellow uh red , and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now .
C :  Nee we we also want to make ano another colour .
B :  Oh right , yeah . Yeah , we should u Yeah . We have to make this like four or five or something . That's what it means .
D :  Yeah , but m
D :  Yeah , because we have more colours than only black .
A :  Yeah , but isn't it per remote that you pay ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  I then I think I p I don I don't think they me mean they're special
B :  Oh right , yeah . Is it per remote ? Yeah .
A :  Half ?
A :  I think you pay half per remote . So each remote with a special colour .
B :  Yeah , that's right , and you one colour per remote . So then it is one .
C :  Yeah , indeed , yeah . You don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote .
D :  Yeah , okay okay , true .
D :  True , true .
B :  No .
A :  I hope .
D :  We have two points spare . Nee one point .
A :  So the battery , we have um advanced chip on print .
B :  One .
B :  So it would be curved , single curve .
A :  Because of thing Yeah , well you can at least make it curved again .
B :  Or not ?
C :  Hmm .
B :  So y you just can't make a nice remote .
C :  Yeah , single curve .
A :  Because that was very important , huh ?
B :  It's too bad for the speaker .
A :  So it's curved , it's still that so we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker .
D :  Mm yep .
B :  Should we change that tha that that's a one if not , or not ? Could you copy it ? And make it uh
A :  We dropped the scroll wheel .
A :  And the rest is the same , huh ?
D :  Y yea the scroll wheel is dropped .
A :  Am I right ? Yes .
B :  The entire uh
C :  Uh . Huh .
D :  Yep .
B :  Perhaps you can then copy page or so .
B :  Ooh .
B :  No . Oh you you made the entire could you
C :  Okay .
C :  Undo , undo . Undo .
B :  Oh not Well .
C :  So , 'kay . Twenty minutes ?
B :  Would you ?
B :  By the Perhaps you can save this one , and then copy or something . Add it copy page .
B :  Select all .
A :  No , but you c yeah .
B :  Alright , something went wrong .
D :  Tap .
A :  Okay , but this this new remote we can afford .
B :  It doesn't work . Let's forget .
D :  It should've work .
C :  Okay , so you had this list at start ? Alright . When did you receive this list ? Ah okay .
A :  Hmm ? No , I hadn't . I just received it .
B :  Yeah . Oh ignore that .
A :  They don't work so hard at the finance department .
C :  Ah okay . I suppose this is a
B :  Well , so
C :  Okay , so we lose the scroll wheel , the s
B :  Too bad .
B :  Yeah . The microphone .
A :  Yeah , and that's it .
B :  Yeah . A and we changed something , I guess , or not ? We
C :  And the microphone .
B :  Oh no .
D :  Yep .
C :  Okay .
A :  Twelve Euro fifty . Um and did you try to make a new design , or what were you trying to do ?
B :  Yeah , I tried to copy that one , but it didn't work .
A :  It didn't work .
B :  So we could fix it like tha that it's like this .
A :  Hmm . Strange .
B :  You could select it all , but then you can't erase .
C :  Strange .
A :  Oh , you can arrange
C :  You can only re erase ? Oh .
B :  Erase . When you saw th li uh Earlier when we selected it , w I couldn't erase anything .
C :  Uh , no .
A :  Hmm , can't you then just say copy ?
C :  Bling .
A :  New page .
A :  Paste . Yes .
C :  Ah .
A :  Select none .
D :  just tap somewhere .
B :  Just tap somewhere .
C :  just up somewhere b uh besides it , right .
A :  Okay , and now you can erase .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I don't think I can , but uh we can try .
C :  Uh , we already try .
A :  Well it should be possible .
B :  Oh , yeah , no , ha-ha .
A :  Oh no .
A :  Well you can draw over it with white uh pen . Oh .
D :  No ?
B :  Yeah , we tried it earlier . It's very much work .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Sorry . Well but that's also useful for the evaluation , because I think uh we have a prototype now which we can afford and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh
D :  Evaluation drops .
A :  design . Doodle . And I think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time .
D :  And erase the mic .
B :  Yeah , goodbye mic .
C :  All I need is no mic .
A :  Let's see , we can save this now .
B :  Oh , I already erased half of the line .
C :  Bon chance
A :  And move back to here .
B :  Too bad , oh .
B :  Like this ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Still looks nice .
A :  And then all green . Okay , well thank you .
B :  Oh , that's erase .
D :  Looks like a iPod .
A :  Oh , no .
C :  No , add
A :  Hey , but you can erase that .
B :  Yeah , that's a bit weird . Oh , now I'm line .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uh-oh .
C :  S Difference between lines and text and the pen .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
D :  Oh . All I need is mic .
A :  And you can't erase this ? Hmm , strange . Okay , well uh just leave it at this and quickly save . Um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . We just did our project evaluation . Um well , I think I can sit for that since it's almost my final slide . Um
B :  No , it's weird .
D :  Station page .
C :  Huh , looks fucking boring now .
A :  what did you think about uh the process ? How satisfied are we ?
C :  Deadlines were sometimes very short .
B :  Yeah . Bu but stressful . You think , no , my presentation isn't ready .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But And stressful .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . Now we worked through each other , something he said yeah , and you had information I also had , so some some things I had in my presentation , they already told , so
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And you could ask things .
B :  Yeah , you had information I didn't have and then uh
B :  Oh right .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ? And uh
B :  Yeah .
D :  So yeah , that I don't think that is the best way to work at for such project .
A :  Yeah .
B :  No .
A :  So you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work .
D :  Yeah , no , or maybe session of five minutes together or something , and then work separate .
C :  Yeah , but but why not work here together , for example ? Why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , you could
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well , probably to simulate the whole working uh process , huh , th you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks .
B :  I think so too .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but then you can work together too when
D :  Yeah m yeah , like she told . Then you can work together too by mail or by , I dunno , chat , something , but now we're completely separated from each other . I don't think that was the best way , but
C :  Huh , oh right .
A :  No .
B :  A chat would also be uh
C :  But the technology was uh fantastic .
D :  Yeah , the technology's okay .
B :  Well , I I don't really like the board , it doesn't really work great . Sometimes I think .
C :  Work now ?
D :  Yeah okay , but I don I do I think becau that's because
C :  Perhaps it is e
B :  It does work , but sometimes it doesn't erase or it doesn't uh
C :  Yeah , perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there . So you can draw uh see it over th on the screen . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , like the f like a plotters or something , yeah . Yep yep yep yep yep .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So you don't think the SMARTboard is is really useful or
B :  But
C :  It's useful , but not m
B :  Well it is useful , but it doesn't really work all the time . Th the pen doesn't
D :  Yeah , it is useful , but
D :  No .
C :  Because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below .
B :  The line is a bit off .
A :  Yeah , so it's maybe a bit unnatural also .
D :  Yep .
C :  Alright .
B :  Yeah , you can point to where you want the line to be .
B :  But
C :  The project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have , you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh
C :  qualitati qualitative uh presentation .
B :  Yeah .
C :  So you used uh this
C :  uh the different PowerPoint presentations uh in which you put your uh material in the
C :  Oh .
A :  That wasn't me . Uh so um the means , we discussed the smart board , and what about uh this digital pen ?
C :  Wasn't me .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I
D :  I didn't use it at all .
B :  I I used it , it it was you can use it , it's quite handy I think .
A :  Yeah , well I use it as a a normal pen and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer , huh ?
C :  But I didn't I uh
B :  Yeah , I used it to y to Yeah , it did work pretty well .
C :  I used it too , but oh well .
D :  I didn't use .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I don't think why you would want to use it actually , but it it does work .
C :  Yeah , because it shou
D :  No yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  To make some designs , it is very easy .
D :  It is it is yeah , it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , and then you can show it to everybody .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But to write it th yeah .
D :  Yeah . It's b bi little bit too big to write .
B :  It doesn't really write normally . It's a bit
C :  Yeah , it's too big , it's too fat .
D :  Yeah . Fat document , those .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , um
A :  and what about the teamwork ?
D :  Team work was okay .
B :  I think it was great , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , well I think so too . we
D :  Only thing that we worked through , past each other . With some things that was only problem , but
C :  Right .
A :  Yeah , but that was it was our assignment , huh ?
B :  Yeah , but it was because we didn't uh Yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah , but furthermore better .
A :  Okay , and maybe I should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point , the leadership .
D :  That's yeah , no prob . Ah .
B :  I thought it was good , but uh Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah well , okay .
C :  Not too much , not too too too too .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  And creativity ? Well , when we look at this I'd say we have been creative , huh ? But
B :  Well .
C :  Yeah , or the room for it was the idea to be creative , so
A :  There was room for
B :  Yeah .
C :  You got some standard ideas in your head and this what came out .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And you get get stuff from the from the computer , but
C :  Yeah .
C :  The information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late or
D :  Little bit uh lo yeah . Too late it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  You just sit there for ten minutes . Yeah , where is that email ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  I played I think seven times Solitaire something .
A :  You did ? Well , I didn't have time for that .
B :  Oh did you ? Is it on there ? Is it on there ? I didn't find the didn't look but uh I didn't look , but
A :  At some times I Sometimes I received like like five emails at at one moment , and then
D :  Oh right , it is there .
C :  Was searching and searching .
D :  No , I I never got that . I always
B :  I got like one email after ten minutes or something .
D :  N yeah .
A :  I even got spam . Or something like that .
B :  That's what we said .
D :  So does this I think lik oh and information was a bit low I think , sometimes , in in in in the beginning I didn't understand what what to do .
B :  And it not a lot uh
B :  No , the first one . I didn't know uh
C :  No , w I didn't know
D :  Yeah , like I with with the remote and I never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control .
C :  Make a r yeah .
B :  nee .
B :  And I didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , so I went , right . Yeah . Just looking at the screen and uh
D :  Yeah , so
C :  Yeah .
C :  No stepping on the table and then looking at the internet page .
A :  And I was working and working and work Okay , well um but after all we can say uh we are satisfied , but it it could've been uh better . When we get uh when we have we would have gotten uh more information .
C :  No .
D :  So , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm . Faster .
B :  Yeah , an
C :  Yeah , more information about the costs .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that will be handy .
C :  First of all I didn't think uh that we were able to make an L_C_D_ screen uh first point , but uh it was possible uh uh , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , it only costs four units . Uh yeah .
B :  Yea uh so tha actually you could make an L_C_D_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no L_C_D_ screen , when you look at that . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that was a bit mean to put it in the end . And uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Uh , I dunno .
D :  Um
D :  Yeah . Nothing .
B :  Think that's about it .
B :  Hmm . Heavier um less heavy laptops . Yeah .
D :  I think we got it already .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh . Faster laptop .
A :  Yeah , they're pretty heavy .
C :  Uh . They were they were just fine .
B :  But that's not really uh
D :  And furthermore the the the network was okay . Everything you loaded was also
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh .
B :  Yeah , everything worked .
D :  av available there .
C :  Right .
A :  And so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work , is what you say . Okay .
D :  So
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , but that
D :  It's now half past four half past three , so
B :  Yeah , but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone .
D :  Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay .
B :  Then it pops up pop up screen came . Five minutes in the meeting . No .
D :  Mm-hm . Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Okay , so more time during the individual work phases . Um okay well uh I just got my warning for the last five minutes , so I'll move on to I guess my last slide , yes , which is the closing . Well uh , we managed , but we did it very quickly . I don't know if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it , but we had to do it , huh , because we have to have a design , and that is within the budget . And we evaluated . Maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product , but we did that before , and we also evaluated the project . And I think uh everybody's uh very happy . At least I am , with the results , so uh celebration , well , for the three of you , because uh I have to write the final report now . But uh well , thank you very much for your co-operation , and I had a very nice day so far . Okay .
B :  Huh .
B :  You did ? Well
B :  Oh , right . Well
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Champagne .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , sure .
D :  No prob .
C :  Oh thank you .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Do we get another email ?
C :  Bling . You're fired .
A :  Um
D :  I think you do .
B :  I I think we have to fill in a questionnaire again , but
A :  Yeah I have t I think we also have to go to our own rooms again , but um well I at least . But maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this , so I can try to include it in the final report .
B :  We do ?
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh th that that one ?
C :  You cannot you can save it .
A :  Yeah , maybe . wants to , but at least this one . I know , we should remove this , but it won't h
B :  You can just Yeah , but it's it isn't a picture or , well , is it ?
C :  You s uh file save as the J_ PEG J_ PEG .
A :  Okay . And uh please put it in the project folder then , huh .
D :  Can you find it as a J_ PEG ?
B :  No , isn't possible . But you can make a screen shot , I think .
C :  No .
A :  Okay , well I uh
D :  No .
C :  No .
A :  I hereby officially close the meeting and uh I hope to see you uh soon .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
D :  In uh
C :  In about five minutes .
B :  Uh oh , export .
A :  Well , I think we'll be a bit a bit longer , but okay . Well , happy celebration , huh ?
C :  Ah .
C :  Oh thank you . Whoo-hoo . Let's let's have party . Let's have some fun . Huh ?
B :  Images .
D :  Celebra Or shouldn't I ?
B :  How big do you want the images ?
A :  How big ? Uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  not too big . Whatever you think is good .
B :  This one ?
D :  Six hundred . No , I yeah .
C :  No that uh is one thousand twenty four .
D :  I think eight hundred six hundred is better .
B :  This one ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  If it browse .
D :  Nah , name .
B :  Um
C :  Desktop .
B :  Well it isn't on the desktop .
D :  Hey .
C :  Mm ?
C :  I do not know .
B :  You can only save it in my documents .
C :  Oh ?
D :  Oh my God .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Oh .
B :  Oh , alright .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Three .
D :  Ten .
B :  Can we stay here ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Ten .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh .
B :  Yeah , alright .
C :  Okay .
B :  Why can't we stay here ?
D : 
C :  Alright .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Celebration time , come on .
C :  Oh .
C : 
C :  Oh .
D :  Peace out nigger .
A :  Okay . Uh first of all I'll start with the costs , because that's going to influence our design . If you Don't know if you al already had a look or not ?
D :  .
B :  Oh no .
D :  Oh , .
B :  No n I I already did it . It's not much . It's just one question .
C :  Did you do your questionnaire already ?
D :  No .
A :  Because we have a problem .
C :  Uh
D :  Oh .
A :  If you look closely , you can see .
B :  Yeah .
C :  It wants
A :  Um I already took the liberty to make some suggestions .
A :  .
A :  .
A :  At the moment we have fifteen buttons , one L_C_D_ screen , one advanced chip-on-print . We use a uh sensor , that's for the speech . Uh we use kinetic energy .
A :  And we wanted uh the buttons in a special colour .
A :  Okay . What's the first thing we should drop ? The special colour of the buttons ?
B :  No that's that's for the trendy uh feel and look . So
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah but everything is .
A :  Uh
A :  Should we switch to a hand dynamo ? Uh that's the still the same idea as the kinetic energy because you have to use it and do things .
D :  No .
B :  Yeah , b but
D :  Yeah but young people like that . So just do normal battery .
A :  Batteries ?
B :  I think the battery option .
C :  Just a normal battery then , yeah .
A :  Batteries .
D :  Yeah .
A :  .
D :  It has to be twelve and a half . Or not ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh .
C :  Oh my goodness .
A :  So
A :  You're going to redesign something . Okay , so we're at twenty five . Um
B :  Oh no .
D :  Uh , yeah .
A :  Do we keep the shape doubly curved or g do we go for single curved ?
C :  Well I guess i we'll have to go for single curve then . I mean we have to drop on everything .
A :  Mm-hmm . Uh
D :  But we can keep it single curved with uh top view still curved , but from the side it's it's flat , and the screen screen is just Well you just have to hold it like this then . So
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Um Uh another option I saw was to drop the buttons one through nine , so you can't directly access a channel , but instead use only the up and down arrows . That would skip nine buttons and four and a half Euros .
C :  How about Sorry .
C :  That's what I was thinking .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Alright . Let's do it then . Yeah . we
C :  A a
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Uh then we have left
B :  But we don't have any basic options any more .
A :  Uh yeah . We do .
C :  And uh 'cause then they don't have to n They don't need special colour as well .
D :  F_ eight .
A :  They don't need special colours . Fine . That's more like it . You were saying something .
D :  Yeah .
C :  That was exactly my point . Like let's drop all the buttons , and just make one I mean we're gonna use the L_C_D_ screen anyway . So we'll just have to use it for everything . And then you can make an overview of channels in the screen , and select a channel , click
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , some more menu options . Yeah . Okay so maybe we can drop few more buttons . But um Now let's look .
B :  Yeah we c could We only need the the the the the menu arrow arrow button uh thing . Everything you can do with with the menu . So With the display .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah we need one integrated button for everything then .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The joystick .
A :  Uh
C :  Yeah . Kind of . I was Because
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , scroll-wheel , push-button uh
D :  Integrated scroll-wheel push-button , yeah .
C :  If you if you go to If you go to our uh view , like you if you are in the sound system there , uh and you wanna adjust the treble for instance , this is just uh an example , y y you wanna see a bar on which you can adjust it from zero to ten for example .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But you want a sound preview of how it's gonna sound , right ? So you wanna click on it , activate it , whe and when you move it , hear the difference of the treble coming out or going into the sound . So you'll you'll need a a kind of a joystick uh button .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah or or the integrated scroll-wheel push-button . So that's kind of on your mouse and then you can click it , adjust it , click again and then you're out of it . But you still But you then still need to have
C :  Yeah .
C :  Exactly .
D :  Well you can use the scroll-wheel as well for um maybe for the channels . But you still um
C :  Yeah it's r Yeah .
D :  You still have to have some some button in the menu to go back .
B :  So you do one inte You can do one integrated scroll-wheel push-button . And then just drop all the other buttons .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh yeah .
D :  Well not all . Not s not sound I guess .
B :  But but th the cost of one integrated button is far more than a few extra push-buttons .
C :  No .
A :  Yeah . It's uh One integrated button is five times the cost of a normal button .
B :  Yeah . So we have to to make it s uh more uh It has to be
D :  Mm .
A :  So
A :  You could also drop j three more of these , without losing much functionality . You just drop the Okay and the Back .
D :  Yeah . Wh wh what what what is the what is the uh sample sensor sample speaker ?
A :  Oh , that's for the speech .
D :  Speech recognition .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Could drop the speech recognition .
D :  Right .
A :  S s Drop speech recognition ?
C :  No but
A :  Yeah that's possible .
B :  We we d
C :  Yeah it's it's expensive , but uh we never considered the possibilities of uh speech recognition . 'Cause it can take the function of a lot of uh uh buttons .
A :  Buttons . That's not very easy to use .
D :  Buttons .
B :  Yeah .
D :  No , it can be disturbed by by noise and
C :  No .
C :  Yeah but lets just say that the speech recognition works .
D :  stuff like that . Let let let me see what's more what's more popular . I guess the the screen was more popular than um than the speech recognition . I have to look on that . Let me see .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh well no I was wrong . There are more people who like speech recognition than an L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay . Because if you d lose the L_C_D_ screen , we need a lot of Yeah . We need a lot of extra buttons .
D :  But if it
D :  But it it it's a it's a both a hypers
B :  We lose our whole concept . Uh so No we just We keep the L_C_D_ .
D :  No , but Well we Yeah we keep the screen . I mean it's it's about the same . Eight one to ninety one percent , uh sixty six to seventy six .
C :  We uh we we haven't really integrated this the speech into the system , so we can might as well s drop that .
A :  Okay so we drop the speech .
A :  And drop it yeah ? Okay . S Fo Four less Euros . So we still have three and a half Euro to lose .
D :  Yeah . Let's drop the speech .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Sixteen Euros .
C :  We need to lose some buttons .
D :  But y y
A :  Yeah if you lose the the Back , the Okay button Uh v let's say we only have the four arrows , and the Menu button .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . And then and then use um
A :  Then you're
A :  Oh and the power button we have also .
D :  The the Okay . And the menu button does also does the okay function then . And then when you in the menu
A :  Yeah .
A :  So that's one Euro .
D :  S so so you activate the menu .
B :  If we do uh two integrated scroll-wheel push-buttons , we can drop all the the push-buttons .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah ? And
B :  With with one uh integrated button we can uh do the whole menu thing . With the other , we can do the the channel , the volume , et cetera .
D :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah . .
A :  That would save zero point two Euros compared to No .
B :  No it's three Euros . No ? Um
A :  Yeah . To This together is more expensive than Oof , it's almost the same as t keeping this . And we can drop these two .
B :  No it's it's n Yeah .
B :  Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Well okay . For example if you have f f four buttons , channel up and down , uh volume left right Okay , I've I think we have to keep that . And then and the power button . So that's five .
B :  It's the
A :  Volume .
A :  And the power button .
A :  That's the basic .
D :  That's basic . That that's what you need anyway . And then for the menu , um you can have a button that activates menu .
D :  Or d or do we just integrate an an an scroll-wheel with a push-button . And then if the moment you use the scroll-wheel , the the the menu gets activated , and then you can scroll , choose an option , click on it , it goes into an feature . Click on it again , selects features , scroll , adjust it . Click again , it's okay . Then you only need one button to move back .
D :  Or or under each option , you set a you set an a screen thing what says back , and you select that one , click again , and you go one step back . And in that menu , scroll , click , one step back . So that then you need five buttons , and one integrated scroll-wheel push-button .
A :  Yep .
D :  But we can't drop three buttons . But I see that's Yeah . So that's not a good idea .
A :  Okay th that's Yeah that's one Euro more expensive .
C :  Which That's even
A :  That's not an option .
D :  Because which buttons do we have now ? Those five which I mentioned , and then menu , and then
A :  Menu , power .
D :  Yeah . F of the four things ? Yeah , th power .
A :  Four arrows ?
A :  Power . Uh
D :  Which more ?
C :  Yeah , if you if you go to eight I don't know how to
A :  Yeah . Okay . So four arrows ? Uh power I believe ? Uh
D :  Yeah . Power . Th Yeah that's five .
A :  We have a Back and a Okay button .
D :  Yeah , okay that's seven , and one to activate the menu , yeah . So okay that's eight . Well we can't reduce that . We we keep the display .
A :  And the Menu .
D :  Oh , well okay .
A :  Yeah , and even if we drop three buttons from here , we still have to make some adjustments around here . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , we need the chip for the for the L_C_ display .
A :  The L_C_D_ ? Yeah .
B :  Let's make the Let's make the case plastic .
D :  Yeah well we need the advanced
D :  Instead of r
A :  Then I rather make it wood . Because then also it's good in the market with the forty five plus uh people .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but but that's not our market .
C :  True .
B :  But
A :  No that maybe not . But maybe it's better than plastic anyway .
D :  Ah no , hard plastic .
B :  Plastic with a with a special colour . A woo wood uh wood uh wood colour . That's an option .
C :  Oh .
D :  Yeah , plastic with special colour .
A :  Yeah ? Yeah okay uh
D :  No but I I Because we have to use the special colour anyway . You forgot that . So let's go for the plastic .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yep . Yeah , yeah .
B :  So we do one one s Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay . Plastic .
D :  And since it's not kinetic , it doesn't have to flip around that much ?
A :  Uh that's easy because plastic is free .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  We still have problem of two Euros .
A :  Yeah , okay . Uh if we dropped uh
B :  No the buttons , those are really needed .
A :  Yeah ?
D :  Yeah we can't drop them .
B :  Yeah th th it's it's uh
B :  An advanced chip-on-print .
C :  Yeah uh
D :  Do we really need that advanced chip for an L_C_D_ display ?
A :  You still need that .
C :  You uh uh
C :  Yeah . So the other option would be to go for the the sample speaker , and Which can use a regular chip , wh which is six Euros in total . That doesn't matter .
A :  S
D :  Oh . I rather keep I rather keep the display . So the only option is an hand dynamo .
A :  No , I keep the re Yeah . Yeah . Because we already designed for it . So
C :  Well yeah .
C :  Exactly .
B :  Oh that
A :  Yeah and something else .
D :  Oh no tha Oh that's one Euro , right .
C :  Yeah but the uh can't we f uh fit all the buttons in an intreg integrated scroll push-button ? 'Cause that will save us one and a half Euro already .
C :  And then if w
D :  And then integrated s Yeah but that would make it not so easy to use . I mean it's not that important , easy to use , but
A :  No y you would rec
A :  Then you have
C :  Th then we have to scroll through a lot of menus to be able to get where you want , huh ? And uh
A :  Then you still need two additional buttons I believe . For the volume . You can use those Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah d at l Yeah . At least one for power .
B :  But the
A :  Oh yeah and power . That's three buttons and this would cost
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah it's just as expensive as what we have now .
B :  But the integrated uh button ? How many func functions can it uh have ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Three . Up , down , Okay .
C :  Yeah endlessly . I mean it can be a power button as soon as it powered on . You can go into you in you main menu , you can choose uh flip channel , uh you can choose sound options , any options .
B :  Okay .
D :  You you press it for like three seconds .
D :  Then then then you should do everything in the menu . On the screen .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Maybe we should . 'Cause we don't have money and w we want the screen .
A :  Yeah , okay . It would save enough Yeah you can choose this , drop these , then we have a half Euro left . So we can maybe still use power button .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but we'd Alright .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I guess we have to .
D :  It s it saves us four Euros and it costs us two and a half .
D :  So let's see , we we drop the price by one and a half . But we still have thirteen left .
C :  We'll we'll be on
A :  Yeah . You see ? Oh still Yeah ? Oh then I miscalculated . Oh yeah .
D :  Thirteen . So still half . There goes the special co Well That would make it less appealing . So that's no option .
A :  Shit . Drop the special colour .
B :  Oh no .
A :  'Kay . What else ? Uncurved ?
B :  No no , it has to be um curved .
D :  We sure about the advanced chip we need for the display ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah it says right here .
A :  They made it very easy for us .
B :  Okay .
D :  Well yeah . yeah . We made it hard for ourselves with the display , but it's a cool feature .
A :  Ah , I don't think I can s uh persuade the management to say , this is better for the market so you sell more than
B :  Okay . Wh what we could do is um
B :  drop the the special colour , and uh do the special colour for the buttons .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Buttons . That's Oh yeah since we only have one button .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but I mean what is meant by special colour ?
A :  I just m I don't I think Uh yeah it's I think it's grey , regular .
B :  Just something else than than black or white I think .
D :  S yeah . Alright .
A :  Grey and rubber .
C :  But we definitely want the thing to be a special colour though . Damn .
A :  Of plastic .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . So I rather have an hand dynamo than than drop the colour . You can still play with it then I guess . I don't know . Yeah , but a hand dynamo costs a lot of energy to keep the screen working . So I guess that isn't an option .
C :  Yeah and then
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  The display
C :  Well , you only have to power it up when you wanna use it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  The
B :  But if you have to power the for ten minutes , then the
D :  Yeah .
C :  I don't know .
D :  Yeah .
A :  No I don't think the current status of uh chips are pretty uh energy conserving , no .
C :  .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah true . Let's let's go for the hand dynamo then .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah hand dynamo ? Do you want an extra button ?
D :  Or or do we Or do we do uncurved and flat ? Instead of
B :  No no it has to be curved . Yeah .
D :  Yeah it has to be curved and has to have that colour . And a screen .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Just put a special special colour of the buttons , or something .
C :  Yeah . Yeah . That's the most import
A :  Yep ? Instead of an additional power button ?
B :  Yeah or spe special form ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  S what what is special f Oh yeah , special form . Maybe that's nicer .
A :  Yeah ? It's for scroll
B :  Yeah .
D :  But we don't have any buttons . So do d Uh make it a special colour then .
A :  Without
C :  We only have
B :  Yeah . But it's it's for the integrated button , I think also . Or
D :  Yeah ma make it a special colour then .
C :  Yeah but
A :  Yeah but it's just a scroll-wheel which you can push down . So
B :  Yeah . Okay . Yeah .
D :  Okay . Make it a special colour and then it look fancy . So
A :  Yeah ?
B :  Yep .
A :  So Woah we're within budget . It's a miracle .
D :  Yeah . Let's let's save it .
B :  Oh just oh ma make it two special colours , but we only have one button . Okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Let's do it like this , I mean , because it does not lose our identity of the product as we
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Okay . Um , well
A :  . 'Kay , this was old .
C :  Well we come back to the drawing board then , huh ?
B :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  Yeah all your designs are uh pretty much
A :  Yeah back to work . Uh
C :  It's silly 'cause we we should have had this meeting before we start drawing .
A :  Did I save it ?
A :  Yeah . I I wanted to go , but I wasn't allowed . So
D :  Yeah but that but that's the fun part of it .
C :  Oh yeah ?
C :  okay .
D :  Alright .
A :  Uh I just forgot to save this . Just a minute .
A : 
A :  .
D :  Yeah what's the next uh phase ?
A :  Yeah , this the last phase of course , so
D :  Uh the agenda .
D :  By your humble P_M_ .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Oh f Frustrated . Alright .
A :  Oh .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Um
A :  Well we first should have had a uh prototype presentation . But well as you saw that hadn't made no sense , because we had to drop it . Uh
C :  Drop everything . Yeah .
D :  Drop , yeah .
C :  We went straight into finance ?
A :  Yeah . Yeah it was more important , so I just
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  For Yeah .
A :  pushed up the agenda . Uh ,
C :  Yeah .
A :  evaluation criteria . You have t produced something about that ?
D :  Yeah that that's Yeah . I uh I sure did . And it combines with product evaluation . Uh so
A :  Uh you put it in the .
D :  We all have to keep in mind what has changed now . So what we have left on the Because evaluation is based on the initial uh user requirements . Alright .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Let's make it big .
A :  F_ five .
D :  Um
D :  Well we evaluate uh the design with a seven point scale , as following . Well the remote controls according criteria blah blah blah . True or false , and then on a scale of seven points , a scale , as we all know it . Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well the criteria are based on the user requirements , uh the trends from the marketing research , and the marketing strategy of the company itself .
D :  Um well they are in a Word document , which I will open now . Yeah . I don't know it's open yet . No .
A :  Alt up
D :  And we all have to uh agree on a certain level . What's this ?
A :  Freaky .
D :  Oh . I don't know . Um
D :  Well the first point is the remote control matches the operating behaviour of the young user . So that means the operating behaviour was using quite a lot of functions .
D :  How do you think about that ?
C :  I think it does . Because the operating behaviour of the young user was also defined in colour and shape and the use of L_C_D_ , right ?
A :  Yeah . Uh , of course we dropped a little bit of those uh
D :  Yeah the us u
D :  It it it's it's mainly con mainly concentrating on a lot of functions , in this question . So do you think
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well , we have extended menus , on the on the L_C_D_ screen . So
D :  Yeah . You can you can ma Yeah , you can make a lot of extended menus . That's true . I mean the the possibilities are almost unlimited , to to build in menus in the screen .
B :  Yep .
C :  I
C :  No .
D :  So on a scale from
D :  one to seven , what do you think ?
B :  Two or three .
D :  Huh ?
B :  Two or three .
D :  Two or three ? Something like that ? Well we have to choose one . So uh what do you say ? I agree on two .
A :  Two .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uh y we should fill this in now . Yeah okay . Uh
D :  Yeah . I uh I say two , personally . But
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah in the new design I s would say it's three . But now , in original design I say two .
C :  Yeah alright .
D :  Yeah well we have to evaluate I guess what we have now .
A :  Okay then I say three .
D :  Yeah ? You say three , and you you said al also three ? Three ? Okay well I say still two , but it has to be three then . Yeah I know . So it's made bold . But it's nah , it's not very clear on the sc Maybe other colour , yeah . That's better .
C :  Yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Hey , you're marketing , eh .
A :  Hmm . M maybe underline .
B :  Or give it a colour .
A :  Red .
D :  Uh
D :  Yeah . Alright . Oh , it doesn't have to be bold anymore .
A :  Oh yeah very true . He types everything .
D :  Alright .
D :  Yeah . Um well the remote control has Wha
B :  Yeah true one .
C :  Definitely one . It has to be .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The remote control has irrelevant or less used functions . For example audio settings and screen settings .
B :  It hides uh basic functions .
A :  Everything . You don't use anything else .
D :  Yeah . Well , yeah . So it it's a very true point . I mean it hides all those function . But , I mean uh they're hidden in the screen . If you don't want to use them , you don't s you s just scroll over them . And you place them
C :  You're not gonna find them .
A :  Yeah . Yeah okay . Yeah .
B :  Yeah true .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  F I don't know where . So that's very true , I guess , for our case .
D :  Uh the second point . It shows the relevant and most used functions . Power button .
C :  Yeah the next Not so much so .
A :  Nope .
D :  Do we ha still have a power button ? Well yeah the button's integrated , huh ?
A :  Uh check with the Excel sheet .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I think we are
C :  Yeah it's uh it's integrated .
D :  Yeah we dropped it . You j you just push it in for Yeah just just push it in for th for three seconds or something , and then Yeah . I don't know . Yeah . Um it shows the relevant and most used functions .
B :  It's in Oh yeah it was integrateds . Yeah .
A :  Yeah integrate it .
C :  E exactly just like a m mobile .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Just go scrolling and it will activate .
C :  .
D :  Yeah uh on the other uh on one side I would say yes , and the other side I would say no .
D :  So it's I don't know .
A :  It shows the most used functions and they are relevant , but
B :  Can you uh change channels directly with with just one button ? No , you have to scroll through the menu , before
D :  Yeah .
D :  With the scroll butt Yeah and then say channel . And then
B :  Yeah . So it's it's not
C :  Well uh we should b build it so that if you don't kind of push into the menu or something , if When it's on , yeah , it's turned on ,
D :  Hmm ?
A :  You say you double click on the
C :  It automatically has the the programme and the volume function , but as soon as you click it you go into the menu or some Of you Or you double click it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But but how do you change from volume to channel ?
C :  No because it has four arrows , right ?
A :  No , not anymore . Because he's now have a scroll-wheel that you can push in .
B :  No .
D :  No .
C :  Oh yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah I was thinking still about our uh integrated joystick .
A :  Like on the the mouse .
D :  No we have n we have no buttons left . So the joystick was not an option . So so you hav So you you have to double-click , I mean , for , I mean , uh volume , and three double click for the menu , or something . Yeah . Yeah . Yeah . Alright .
C :  Say .
C :  Yeah that is a bummer .
A :  Yeah .
A :  To get into menu . Yeah .
B :  Oh no .
A :  Or hold it ten seconds .
C :  We'll make it a Morse code .
D :  But but ease of use was not very important , may I remind you . So that's Yeah but that that's not a question . Uh the remote control shows the relevant and most used functions . Well I think it's pretty much in the middle .
A :  No no no . Uh it should be trendy .
A :  Yeah . Four .
D :  You have to search for them in in the in the s in the screen , in the menu . So
A :  Yeah , im in the menu .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Seven .
D :  So maybe it's more like a f a five . Or
B :  Yeah . Five .
C :  Yeah I would go for five or six , yeah .
D :  Yeah . Five or six ?
A :  Five .
C :  Okay five . Let's not diss our remote .
B :  Five . Yep .
D :  Five ? Alright . Yeah .
A :  It's the weirdest remote control I've ever seen . So
D :  Oh .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yep .
C :  Just one button .
A :  Well it's different .
D :  Yeah . Alright . Uh the the remote control makes use of technolog technological innovation like L_C_D_ screen and speech recognition . Well yeah but we dropped the speech recognition . But it has at least one innovation .
C :  But Uh yep .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it's still
A :  Yeah , I say two .
C :  We still have the fruit and vegetable print .
D :  I say two then .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Oh , that's the next .
D :  Yeah but that that's not that's not this question . Uh thi uh that's the other question .
C :  Fr Oh I mean the Oh never mind . I'm a bit lost .
D :  This one .
B :  I think a two . No .
A :  Two .
D :  Two yeah . I think L_C_D_'s more useful than speech What ? Oh not the bold one .
C :  .
B :  Yep .
A :  Yeah definitely .
C :  It's way more practical , yeah .
D :  Right . Okay , it has a fancy look and feel by using fruit and vegetable prints , primary colours and sponge-like material . It should have been two questions . I realise now , because sponge-like material is dropped . But the look and feel
C :  Yeah .
A :  You still have rubber d Or no .
C :  Yeah . So we still uh we still have the primary colours . But only on the on the outside , not on the button .
B :  No you got a plastic .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The button has also colour . Yeah .
C :  Yeah ? Okay .
A :  Yeah . The one button we have .
D :  Yeah . The one .
C :  Yeah . Yeah still we we dropped also on the the double uh curve .
A :  Yeah you could check with the Excel sheet .
D :  Mm mm .
B :  Yeah . You only have one Yeah .
D :  Yeah we have single curve now , and no and no material . So maybe in the middle or something .
C :  And and colour .
C :  Yeah . S
B :  Four . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I mean it's
A :  Yeah or three .
C :  Uh
D :  worth the Yeah .
A :  We have something .
C :  Actually we d we didn't do so well on this one . Because it's basically an old one , uh with little curve on the side , and in a different colour . Still , it's still hard . I mean the sponge-like and the three D_ shape , that would give it something young and fresh .
D :  Yeah .
A :  New . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . But then we would have to drop the screen . Oh red .
B :  Red .
D :  Yeah .
A :  You like both .
D :  Yeah . I like bold .
D :  Uh the remote control displays the corporate logo .
A :  Um oh yeah .
B :  Mm yeah yeah .
C :  Of course .
A :  I just couldn't Um , just one minute .
D :  Yeah . You just have to draw it .
C :  Yeah but it be because uh we couldn't hardly draw on the b s on the lower half of the screen , we could not make it big enough to actually draw in the
B :  It's the white part uh
A :  .
B :  Yeah . We have a we have a
D :  Yeah .
C :  So I mean I wanted to put digits on the buttons as well . But
A :  So
D :  But there's uh enough space for the corporate logo . I mean , if there's only one thing .
C :  Hell yeah . If we have only one button .
D :  Yeah . So I will say that is very true .
A :  .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And even the shape we have now uh simulates kind of an R_ and the reversed R_ , doesn't it ? So
D :  Yeah . The remote control is easy to use . Well I would say Skill , uh I would say six , or something . I don't think it's easy to use , or not so .
C :  No .
C :  The only e the only thing easy about it is that you don't have to move your fingers . 'Cause it has only one button .
B :  Ah i
D :  Yeah .
B :  And that you only have to control one button .
C :  Yeah exactly .
D :  Yeah . It it it has a nice screen . But Yeah .
B :  It gives visual feedback . So
D :  Yeah . Well I I would say a five or a six .
C :  I would say six .
B :  I think a five . Five .
D :  What do you say ? Easy to use ? Five or a six ?
C :  It's really not easy to use . 'Cause you're putting everything
A :  No not anymore .
D :  So a six , more .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , uh I would go for the six too . So
B :  Okay . Yeah .
C :  Most votes count . Um
D :  Um well , another question , uh the remote control is durable . I don't know if that's the correct word . But uh
B :  Yeah that looks uh great .
B :  Yeah . Nah
C :  Definitely in casing , 'cause we have a hard plastic Yeah . Yeah because the the batteries , those thingies last forever .

D :  It's not
D :  Yeah , true .
A :  Yeah okay .
D :  So a four . It's it g it g goes , it's not the best we could do , I guess . But it all has to do with the budget , because it's it's not the bad idea we had , so
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah , four is okay .
D :  Alright , yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  So
D :  So if I understood it right , we have to count these numbers .
C :  That's it .
A :  Ooh . And Yeah ? What ?
D :  Uh
D :  Yeah . Mm-hmm . Oh
A :  Yeah .
D :  Oh Alright . Word document , the Yeah we have to count them .

A :  Count them . Add them ? Or
D :  Uh
D :  Yeah just add them and then uh divide them . Yeah .
A :  Could somebody start calculator ?
D :  Mm . I all made it po I I all made it I all made it possible uh for a positive questions , so we can count it . I mean if you have reversed question , you have to reverse the scale , uh Yes .
C :  Ah we can do the math . Uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , yeah . You have to 'Kay . So four and
C :  Yeah .
C :  Did you make this questionnaire or what ?

D :  How hard is it ?
B :  Okay . It's your turn .
C :  Pretty difficult .
D :  Yeah just use Oh there tho uh there's no n There's no num pads .
B :  No it's if you press twice on the plus button , then you get s s
A :  Start over ?
A :  You can Oh yeah .
B :  No . That's why it's uh
D :  It's a it's a bit uh
C :  Just type in the digits . They're all one digit numbers right ? And then you can count them together .
D :  Yeah . I think you can just count them by a Um let's move over . Three , plus one , four . Nine .
B :  Just count it to Yeah .
A :  Okay . Three , four , nine .
A :  Uh
D :  Uh , yeah . Are you here ? Eleven . Fifteen .
C :  Eleven . Fifteen .
A :  Eleven , fifteen .
B :  Sixteen .
C :  Sixteen .
D :  Sixteen , yeah .
C :  Seventeen .
D :  No sixteen . Uh sixteen plus six . Twenty two .
A :  Seventeen .
C :  Oh what ?
B :  Twenty two .
A :  S Uh
C :  How hard is this ? Never mind . Twenty four . Twenty eight .
D :  Twenty two , yeah ? Tw
B :  Twenty four . Twenty six .
D :  Twenty Twenty eight .
B :  Oh , sorry . . Oh my .
A :  That was the last one . That was that . Yeah . So divided by nine .
C :  Twenty eight .
B :  Okay . Twenty eight .
D :  Twen Uh okay .
D :  By nine . That's uh three uh Or le less than a three .
B :  Hmm .
A :  So
C :  Yeah the lower the The lower the score the better , right ?
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Twenty eight
C :  Yeah but
A :  Divided by nine .
D :  di divided by nine makes three point one one one one one one one .
A :  So thr t two .
A :  So we're better than average .
C :  But
D :  Yeah .
C :  I Are you sure we this number actually tells us somethings ? I don't think so because some questions are related to positive issues and some to negative . So if you give a true to a positive , it actually means that the low the lower the better . But if you give true to a negative question
A :  No .
B :  Some questions are Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but there are no negative questions I guess . Good example . Durable use . Easy to use . This is good . Fancy look and feel , that's good . Technology innovation was good , because of a marketing uh requirement . Re relevant most used function . And hides these functions . That was also a good thing .
C :  No ?
C :  Durable , that's good . Easy to use .
C :  Yeah . . Also good .
C :  Yeah okay .
C :  I guess you did do it .
B :  Oh yeah . Yeah .
C :  Oh yeah yeah . No
D :  And then matches the opera of the user was also a good thing . So it were all positive questions , by uh by purpose . So
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Okay .
C :  Yeah true .
D :  Yes , so the It tells us something , yes . Becau But the picture would be a lot different if we didn't have to drop those uh those things , I guess .
B :  Oh great .
A :  Things , yeah .
C :  Yeah definitely definitely . Because now it's just an average It's remote .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . Nah it it's it's better than average , but
C :  Yeah okay because of the L_C_D_ screen . But uh it looks and stuff , it still uh it's not , it's not really eye-catching , except for the colour .
D :  Yeah . So th
A :  It's still yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Has some shortcomings .
D :  No . The colour and the screen .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay so Um this we had , this we had . We have to do a product evaluation . Uh prototype presentation we dropped . So Uh the finance we looked . We have redesigned . Uh not on that , but
C :  Product evaluation .
D :  Yeah we we have to maybe if we have to redesign it on this
B :  Okay it's your turn now .
A :  So you can just make one big L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Shall we try ?
D :  With some casing around it , yeah .
C :  Black .
C :  Okay uh we're still gonna go for the fancy colours ? But are we gonna stick with the green or are we gonna do blue ?
A :  Yeah uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah we we can just uh use this one . And then uh over-paint it with uh uh the green uh he only needs one button . Yeah . Or we have to delete this one or
A :  The the button has a special colour , the frame has a special colour .
D :  Yeah .
C :  One scroll button and
A :  It's plastic . And single curved .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Oh and you might want to add a uh infrared LED .
B :  Oh oh no .
D :  Oh yeah .
A :  Otherwise it uh doesn't function uh so well .
C :  For what ?
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So that's
D :  Do we have to do other things ?
A :  Well I have to um um make an uh report of every decision we made so far . And I try to get chip just before uh I uh receive the Excel sheet . So I
D :  Or just redesign ?
D :  Alright .
D :  Yeah . So you made a start , right ?
A :  Yeah I'm I'm somewhere , but maybe you can help me .
C :  Should give it some time ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yay .
B :  Okay , but how do we make the the scroll uh button ? It's just one yeah .
A :  Uh
A :  I was here . So
C :  Have to take this away also .
D :  Alright .
A :  Ah
C :  And this um
B :  Uh that's the infrared uh thing .
C :  Oh yeah , of course . Um pen yeah ? Format . Current colour red . Oh Yeah we did our special colour for the Line widths , now that's a ten .
D :  The the target group has a weak spot for fruit and vegetables , like primary colours , spongy shape . The playfulness , we decided to use kinetic energy as a power sour
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  That's conceptual , yes .
A :  That's enough to get started with , so
B :  Yeah . Um , uh it's just a scroll Yeah , is it's horizontal or vertical ?
D :  Mm .
C :  It's gonna be one str scroll .
D :  How many pages ?
A :  Uh , I just took one for every step and then a conclusion .
D :  Alright . Y you have you have done the first two .
B :  I think
C :  Horizontal's easier too , 'cause you can
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , and and the look and feel is
B :  Yeah .
C :  Is it more natural than this ?
A :  Well I think I have to make a p an issue called finance .
B :  Yeah , yeah .

A :  I don't think so , if you see the options . But
D :  Uh
C :  Okay special colour . We do have special colour .
C :  Does it mean uh that
B :  Yeah red is already a special colour , I think . So

A :  From up there ?
A :  No .
B :  Hey , you've got it uh read only . So you have to uh
A :  Yeah it's somewhere in here .

B :  .
B :  It's too uh
A :  .
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah there is some kind of projection I think .
D :  Yeah it it's a beamer , but then with a within a mirror , yeah . So it looks like a big screen , but in fact it isn't .
A :  Yes .
C :  With a with a mirror , huh ? Or something . Yeah .
A :  .
C :  So are we gonna change anything to this ? I mean is it gonna
B :  It is

A :  Well
B :  It's now single curved . So
D :  Th this is flat . Yeah .
C :  This is gonna be flat . Yeah exactly .
B :  It's flat . Oh no .
B :  Okay . It doesn't matter . It's it's
D :  But it's it's better to have in the front , this kind of shape , because it looks nice .
D :  I mean you see more of this than of that .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , more like that .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And this is also gonna be
D :  It's not very uh ideal .
C :  Nope .
D :  Do like this .

D :  Yeah .
D :  What's this ?
B :  That's the detector uh for the
D :  Ooh .
B :  Okay .
C :  Maybe
D :  But I don't see a detector over there .
B :  Yeah . I don't know .
C :  No it's I think you only need two points . Or not .
C :  No , you sh
D :  I thought it was a kind of thing to put it on , and then draw right lines or something .
B :  Maybe that's why it's it's not working , because it's more
C :  Slanted yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Or just messed it up .
C :  Well maybe .
B :  Oh . Oh yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah it it matters for the aim of this thing .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but it wasn't good .
B :  You've to make it s uh
B :  ninety degrees .
D :  Yeah it it has to touch the corners , I guess . But th this one wasn't good , because if I was drawing here , I drew a line and then it came over here .
A :  Um now you probably have to recalibrate . Oh , five minutes to the end of the meeting . And the recalibration is done using this icon here .
B :  You have
D :  Oh .
B :  Oh we're always long .
B :  Yeah , can we t can we get to that i
D :  Ooh .
B :  Oh it's not working anymore .
A :  Yeah well I just
D :  Yeah yeah , it's it's okay . It's working again .
B :  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah , it's it's working , it's working .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . You go ahead .
D :  It's better than before .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  We're improving uh Yeah .
D :  Yeah that's improved uh pretty much .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah it's only a bit like to that side , but that is that one by the way . 'Cause this one makes the angle either like this . So i if I change this , it will go there , if I change that , will go there .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but it's better , it's better
B :  No it
D :  Mm .
D :  No . It's better than it was I guess .
C :  Mm-hmm . I will take this away 'cause it looks messy .
D :  Silly .
D :  Yeah . Works pretty well . Five minutes before the meeting's over . And then ? We have to present
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Then I have to uh uh write this , and I don't know if you have to present , because I didn't receive any information about that so far .
D :  Alright .
C :  Maybe we will .
A :  Maybe we get a a final mail .
D :  So it after the after after these five minutes , you have to
A :  Yeah . Yeah , I have still ten minutes to finish the report .
C :  What's this anyway ?
B :  So cake .
D :  Alright . After after that five minutes , you have ten minutes to finish it , or Alright . And we uh
C :  It looks like candle wax .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And you can uh just uh relax and uh have cup of coffee or oh no , they don't have beer here so you can't celebrate . You can just if you ma finish my presentation please .
D :  Right . Chill .
D :  Huh .
A :  Uh over there .
D :  Uh Yeah ?
A :  The presentation is still open . So if you finish that then you'll see uh
A :  Yeah next .
D :  Next slide .
A :  Oh yeah , we have to do the project uh evaluation . Just uh do that quickly . Uh
D :  Yeah ? How do you do it ?
A :  Uh well basically what that says , we discuss it and um
D :  Alright .
A :  So how were did the project process uh go ? Did you , were you all pleased with the process as it was ? Or are there uh
C :  Uh th uh do you mean the the interaction between us ? Or
A :  Yeah the interaction and the steps we followed , and and so forth .
C :  Yeah well at first I was really stressed . Because it went a bit fast . But then as I knew the tempo that I had to be on , the second time I think I did a bit better . And the third time yeah , I mean
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And we move more to to working together as team , because at first you you make your individual contribution , and then come here , and you have no idea what the others have to make . And then finally you have some idea , okay this is gonna w this is what we gonna make together and okay I will arrange this and you will arrange that , and you have a k a kind of idea what you can expect on the next half hour when you have to work on your own . So
B :  No .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  .
B :  No .
C :  Yeah , yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah we
D :  The process , I mean , the interaction between us became better and better I guess .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Especially after the first meeting .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And
D :  Yeah , especially if f f if you see uh you se you saw the largest difference from the first to the second meeting I guess .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Definitely .
A :  Okay and was that due to my leadership ?
B :  Yeah yeah yeah .
C :  Well you did become more assertive the the second time round , so that Yeah . You were more in charge kind of thing .
A :  Yeah ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That okay ?
A :  Okay . Um was there uh enough room for creativity ?
C :  I guess so .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but only the the financial parts uh Yeah .
C :  I mean
D :  Li Limiteded afterwards , but
D :  If if you don't take that into account , there's plenty of room for creativ creativity . Also not only the drawing and the the making of the thing itself , but also in explaining it to the other people , by means of uh
C :  We were pretty democratic .
D :  the the board and uh PowerPoint and Word and stuff like that .
A :  So and the uh about the board digital pen ? Uh was that helpful or
C :  Yeah .
A :  Ooh .
D :  Mm uh I think in in essence
D :  the digital pen is better than the SMARTboard . Because it it it just works better . I mean uh uh I've made yeah , uh I've made several notes just to test it , and and just put the pen in into it , and then it came onto my screen and it looked perfectly . So it it's better a better device than uh
A :  Yeah it works .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Maybe Yeah .
D :  than the screen . But the screen is useful , in essence , but it doesn't work that well .
C :  It's uh it's The the pen is more intuitive , 'cause we're all used to writing with pen . And uh as I said , uh I uh have no idea how PowerPoint works , so will take me half a day to be able to make a normal PowerPoint presentation . But once I get to know the program probably , I mean , it looks better , you know . Or uh something like that . You can
A :  Use the pen .
D :  Yeah .
C :  give it a kind of a home style , like we have i
C :  the the logo and everything . And I don't know .
A :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Yep .
A :  Blink . Oh .
D :  Warning . Finish meeting now .
B :  Finish meeting .
A :  Okay , are are there any new ideas about this ? All I think
D :  Well , it It's use especially useful , I guess , to to evaluate designs and graph graphical stuff .
A :  I didn't really receive , yeah .
A :  Uh uh w uh S sorry uh
D :  And and
D :  the screen and stuff like that .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I think the PowerPoint is is too limited . You can't uh draw easy in in PowerPoint . It has to be uh yeah . The drawing board has to be integrated into PowerPoint , so that you can just easily
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah the the the problem with PowerPoint for me is that you have to i put in the pre-made chunks c as well . You know , you can draw something on the sketch-board and then take it there , or whatever .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . But it it's useful to to show something to to an a small audience , and then to
B :  Yeah just for text , for text it's uh it's okay . But
D :  Yeah . These these kind of screens this size are useful to discuss things . So
A :  Oh . Uh we should uh enter our questionnaire .
D :  Yes . Check your email .
D :  You also .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Ah .
A :  Woah .
C :  Alright .
D :  Right .
A :  Okay . Uh okay .

B :  Oh .
B :  Okay .
A :  Hope so .
A :  Um
C :  Yeah we have to pull it this way , huh ? Wait .
A :  Wouldn't wanna be Project Manager . Uh , what we going to do . Um , once again I'm uh gonna take minutes . So , um no presentation for me . Uh , first we have a prototype presentation by G_ and G_ .
A :  Afterwards some uh
B :  Yo .
D :  J_ and J_ .
A :  eval eval evalu evaluation s sorry . Uh evaluation crit criteria . Uh , in combination with the finance I um uh I received uh a an uh an Excel uh file
C :  Evaluation .
D :  Evaluation .
B :  Evaluation criteria .
D :  Hmm .
A :  which we have to fill in later on . Um , you see . Uh , and then we must see uh if we uh stay under the twelve and a half Euro . So , that's uh that's a big l so let's uh wait it uh um we have we have must uh , we must have uh some time for that uh because it will be uh yeah , quite a lot of mathematics . And after that , uh uh an evaluation of uh the process how we uh how we have done it here with the SMARTboard , with the with our laptops , with the all uh all this . And uh afterwards , uh we closing . Once again , forty minutes , so uh let's start . I would g give the word to um G_ and G_ for the prototype presentation .
D :  Hmm . Interesting .
D :  Ah , okay .
B :  Oops .
D :  Cool .
C :  Mm-hmm . That's gonna be t problem .
D : 
B :  Some creative uh

B :  Take it away .
A : 
B :  Um , this was our first concept . We decided to use a single touch-screen . So , we've worked out this concepts , how to how to hold it , where to put the buttons and and stuff . And um , well , we began with uh with a form of shape , that is uh is easy to hold w in one hand , left or right handed . So , we made i it a little bit less thick and uh it has some ar artistic meaning . No ? This uh isn't nothing .
B :  Idea maybe uh is better .
B :  Um well , during the meeting I showed you the concept of uh placing the buttons on top , usable with your thumb , and uh the menu structure , uh if necessary , with your other hand , so it's just gonna hold it easily . And it has to be acce accessible with your uh other hand too , of course .
B :  So we began uh working out a concept .
C :  Yeah , uh well , and as you saw , we would just have the basic remote with the panel L_C_D_ uh screen . Well , these would be the main buttons , h you could uh change them later on in your own profile if you want to . But , well it's standard they will be delivered with this kind of uh set-up . We have the more advanced menu uh setting right here . We have the sub-menus and stu stuff . We made a top oh , or a front view . Just so like you wanna uh back view . As you can see , this uh there , there are uh two uh weird bumps in it . This is for uh the added uh effect of uh well uh y youth and dynamic . And uh this is for the artistic effect . Well , what we figured is uh we'll show you a picture later on you have more b a better idea after that . But , idea is for to stay in balance with these two uh with these two . And so when you put it on the table , it will just lay down . It won't uh roll around or stuff . But it will lie more in your hand like an old telephone maybe , or like these old uh phones . Y you you may get the idea . So thi this is about uh how we figured it should be . The s panel we g you would hide with some more uh rubber layers , like we discussed early on . Uh , you would s you wouldn't see the uh straight panel , but more fluidly and round .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , the panel just uh of course goes like this .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But the overlaying layer is uh a little bit uh curved and stuff .
D :  Okay .
A :  No , okay .
C :  And uh , in these bumps you could actually uh put some electronics uh that would you can make a more thinner uh design , and that would actually look very nice , yeah . And uh , about the colour , what have
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Oh , we added that this um can be held with your hands for this maximum is om yeah , one and a half centimetres . So , you have room here for your battery and maybe even other um electronic chips . S and you can just be the the layer of the touchscreen and some have some wires underneath it to make it as uh thin as possible in the middle for good grip .
D :  Okay .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah , f uh , as colours , do you do you have the picture in uh
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh yeah . Now , well this is the idea about uh the bumps . Uh , you can see there's a v a very uh youthful uh dynamic uh exterior . It uh you just want to hold it you uh you are young and uh dynamic like us .
D :  'S l it's like an uh Easter egg .
C :  Yeah , it's like an e but this is for children . We we want a more adult version . But , this is like a remote control for children .
B :  Yeah .
A :  It's called a weemote
C :  . A weemote . Yeah . Hey , that's actually a brilliant uh marketing stand . Uh , but So this actually basic the idea . We we just want to build a more uh adult vers adult version of of this .
D :  Weemote .
A :  Weemote .
D :  Wait what I w got in mind .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , I can imagine that .
C :  And and for colours , we we figured starting with basic colours like uh white or metallic grey . Those are the technological colours actually , so it d
B :  Yeah . It would be best to to appeal to a broad public and make the covers exchangeable , so the young people will buy an orange and a red and blue and a purple , but when the o older people uh go in the shop and they see uh an orange um remote control , it would be less appealing than a white one . And young people , we think , are a little bit more flexible , they think , ah I'll buy for a couple of Euros some noi nice hip uh
C :  Or blue or whatever .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm . Maybe it's an idea to sell it without a cover , so that you can pick a cover in the in the shop .
B :  Well ,
B :  um I think a cover is necessary , 'cause als otherwise you'll just have the L_C_D_ screen . So , there must be some cheap standard cover , um maybe white or something , that's could comes with it and you can buy , so we can make extra money .
D :  Yeah , okay . Yeah , okay .
D :  Hmm . Mm .
A :  Yeah , but uh you d you mustn't forget that uh our target aim is younger people . Uh , we had decided to uh put uh some flashy fruity colours in it , uh and uh in the survey from uh Milan and Paris uh it uh it came out that uh uh the d the older people are uh more willing to uh to spend money on extra features . So I think uh it will be a better idea to have some uh flashy fruity colours as as a standard , and for the people who uh really want uh a more sophisticated , more traditional look , they're willing to pay uh that . They want uh they want more luxury stuff , but they have the money to do it and they want to b to buy that . So , maybe it's an idea to put that as an extra and not as a standard .
D :  Oui okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  The other way around , you mean .
C :  Oh yeah .
B :  Uh-huh .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , maybe yeah , perhaps you're right . Uh , I I would I would actually agree with this sounds logical .
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  An another idea . Uh , maybe we could uh develop a cover uh with wood style . They'll please the elder users as well .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Well yeah , a colour of a wood style , a white c and uh a couple of h hip uh fruity colours . And lea uh l delivered standard with a fruity colour , but not too not too much . This is banana and mango , not not purple or p orange and yellow .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
C :  Nah . Yeah .
D :  Not not too uh yeah .
D :  Yeah , exactly .
A :  Yeah . But , the mai I think th uh the standard must be some kind of uh uh attractive flashy colours . Not too , but w a little , because that's our aim . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Or blue or
B :  Ah . Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , li like like this like this . This isn't this isn't too much , is it ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay . No . Yeah .
D :  .
C :  I f
A :  Well , the buttons don't have to be uh all uh all of yeah .
D :  Well I I I think so . Yeah , except for the buttons it's it could be a standard model .
C :  Yeah . The buttons , I
A :  It
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , uh something like this would be nice . Okay , that's that's it from us .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Thank you .
D :  'Kay , it's my time now .
B :  It's my turn .
A :  The Marketing Expert .
C :  Uh-oh .
C : 
D :  Okay .
D :  During the
D :  Oh .
D :  During the design uh design life-cycle we uh
A :  Sorry .
D :  we made lot of requirements and trend analysis and stuff . Um , now is the time to uh evaluate our prototype concept to uh
D :  to the past requirements . So we are going to evaluate the design according to the past user requirements and trends analysis . Um , we're going to do that with a seven point scale .
D :  Opening a Word document now .
D :  Okay .
D :  One oh , okay , uh I have to expla explain something . We have to
D :  be consensive about about things . So , it has to be a group uh group decision . Okay ? Uh
A :  Okay , so we gon we gonna evaluate the
D :  We're going to vote . We yeah ? The prototype . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , the the thing we saw . Okay , just saw .
D :  Okay , one . The remote control is designed for people with age below forty .
A :  Yeah . Seven ?
D :  Seven is false .
A :  Uh , true . Sorry .
D :  Yeah , b one or
A :  Yeah , one I think .
D :  Most true ?
C :  Why ? Yeah , it's not just uh designed for people under the age of forty . It's also designed for people above forty .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , so so a o one is appropriate ? Or , more like a four . Three .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  So
B :  No no , a little more in the middle . No , uh three or yeah .
C :  I have I've Yeah , two or three , because it's not just uh the qu question is aimed at is it designed for people with age below forty . But it's also designed for people of age above forty . So ,
A :  Okay .
D :  Ah , exactly .
D :  Exactly .
C :  I'll say it's about three .
B :  Yeah , it will be primary appealing to to m minus forty , but also appealing to
A :  Okay .
D :  Three .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But also for yeah , okay . Uh , second . The remote control is beautiful .
B :  Yeah . It's Wow .
D :  Yeah , acco according to us , it's one ? Or
C :  Yeah , I I think
B :  Yeah , it's the marketing uh angle on television . We have a wonderful
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , p s
D :  Of c of course you have to be uh very positive and uh enthusiastic about your own product .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well , it's also fancy then .
D :  Three . Uh , the remote control looks fancy .
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Of course . We have a perfect remote .
D :  One ?
C :  Yes .
A :  Yep .
D :  Good . Four . The remote control has big , clear channel switching buttons .
B :  Yes .
B :  Yeah yeah , oh they have to agree but
C :  Yeah . Leads to user face , yeah .
A :  Yes .
D :  Daniel .
B :  I'm the User Interface uh Expert .
D :  Uh , teletext buttons and volume buttons ?
B :  Um , uh no . You you've different menu .
A :  No teletext buttons . Teletext is in the menu .
D :  False ?
C :  Yeah , false .
B :  And volume is impo yeah .
D :  And volume ?
A :  Volume is true .
D :  True .
C :  Uh , hmm .
D :  Big and clear ?
C :  Yeah , the they are big and clear . .
B :  Yeah yeah , big and clear . But you could make a teletext button uh six . Otherwise , the people who read this uh are gonna think we have no teletext button .
A :  Yeah , big and clear .
D :  Hey .
D :  Hey .
D :  Hide .
C :  Yeah , but but the teletext button . Yeah , you can ch That's in a menu . So , it's w yeah , it it it it isn't entirely unclear , but So , I wouldn't give it a seven . I would give it a more a five or a six .
D :  It's it's not yeah , it
B :  No . Yeah .
D :  Five ? Okay .
C :  Uh , I don I don't know . What do you think , uh Mister Project Manager ?
D :  Yeah , it's it's yeah .
A :  Oh , okay . Well , I agree .
A :  I was thinking very black and white .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Black and red .
A :  Thank you J_ .
B :  Okay , don't forget to save it . Uh
D :  Red . Okay . Volume .
D :  The remote control is easy to be found .
B :  Uh well , when we put in fancy colours , yeah and Yeah .
A :  Fruity .
C :  Yeah , it has these all these fruity colours and it has a strange shape . So , if you so if you have trouble finding it
B :  But , um it it's not making any sound uh , have we deciding ? So
D :  Oh , okay , but 'kay , look . If you put uh your normal uh remote control under your bed , or you throw this remote control under your bed , is it better findable ?
B :  It'll make a difference . We have the better re I don't know . Yeah , I think so . My remote control's black .
D :  A li little bit maybe ?
B :  A little bit , but yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well , we p we can do it glow in the dark . So , if it's in the dark place , you still see it glowing .
D :  Four ?
B :  Uh
B :  K yeah . Fo fo yeah fo five is .
D :  I
D :  Ah , I I I think five . It's it's it doesn't really make a lot of
C :  Well , then uh then I'll go for four . Because uh four is between three and uh uh also between between true and false . Uh ,
D :  Four ?
B :  Yeah , okay , you're right .
D :  Yes , but five is between four and six .
A :  I think Ah , you must see it as
C :  so I'll I'll go for four .
A :  uh , w uh according to uh the the other uh remote controls , there may uh uh be there in your uh T_V_ room , this one will stand out , I think .
B :  Yeah .
D :  B_ .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that that's a better question actually .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , it it's
B :  Yeah . If your uh fifteen remotes in a drawer , uh you find it , yeah ?
A :  Exa I think that that's what it's about .
A :  If it if this lying on your couch , you're you're you think what's that for kinda orange uh thing . So
D :  Yeah , yeah . But but the survey under users was that they uh really lost it .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's stupid .
D :  Like , no not uh not seeing it , but lost it in the house or something . But , okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh , but when you lost it you're just not
C :  Well , if i if you see a strange shape lying somewhere , uh then you'd uh recognise it as , whoa , that is strange . Yeah . Yeah , what is that . Uh ,
A :  That's our remote control .
D :  Yeah , okay . Yeah , I I agree , I agree . Okay . Eight , the remote control has fresh , fruity colours .
B :  Yeah , mostly when you lose your remote control , it it's under your
C :  so it's
B :  Most of times when you lose it you're sitting on it . Uh
A :  True .
B :  Um I would call uh choose two , 'cause we decided not to make two f uh fresh colours , as it would not .
D :  Yeah , yeah , not too flashy .
C :  Yeah .
D :  The remote control is made of soft material .
B :  Um ,
C :  Yeah , rubber , is kind of soft .
B :  kinda soft , but but not this . Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but not too soft we have decided .
D :  Three ?
A :  Three , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah yeah , easy to use , very afford .
A :  Easy to use . One .
D :  Easy to use ?
A :  Yeah , can it be zero ?
C :  Well , I don yeah , it is kind of
D :  Top easy to use ? It's it's not the most easy to use
C :  It
B :  No , you can do two , because um it can be easier . But then you're l yeah , but then you'll lose function f yeah , functionality and our fancy uh look , so .
C :  No . Uh
D :  It can be easier .
C :  It could yeah .
D :  Jus just with ten buttons , that's the easiest .
C :  Functional ability .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but the most uh easy to use is just with one button
B :  But
B :  It is r it is rather easy to use , because you have the primary buttons always visible .
D :  on t
D :  Yeah , okay , but easy n not not the most easy to use , I think .
C :  .
C :  No , it's it I I'll go for two . My vote's on two .
B :  No .
D :  Two ?
B :  Yeah , m mine too .
A :  Okay , two . Yeah , two .
D :  We also have to compare it to the uh
D :  to the remote controls on the market nowadays . So
B :  Yeah , but waits just a minutes . Inspiration .
A :  What's the time ? We also have uh to do the evaluation , uh the production costs and uh stuff .
B :  These are the m regular remotes .
D :  Yeah yeah , I'm uh hurrying . Okay , eleven . The remote control is innovative .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yes , true , one .
C :  Yes .
D :  A very of course .
A :  You're agree , Tim ?
A :  You haven't seen a more innovative uh thing in uh Paris ?
D :  The remote control has m remova removable from Multilux .
B :  Yes , one .
B :  Very multifunctional .
B :  No .
D :  The remote control , i it has speech recognition . False .
C :  Yes , it
A :  False .
B :  This is used with speech recognition , this .
D :  The remote control has built-in games ?
B :  Yes .
B :  But uh , maybe make it two , because the games are in a sub-menu and not uh it's not an entire game .
A :  Yeah , but they are built in , so it's one .
C :  Yeah , they are built in .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Not down .
A :  Okay .
D :  And the last , paren parental advisory function .
C :  You really like the parental advisory .
B :  Yes .
A :  Freak .
D :  Yes , I do .
B :  Th did you make this or the
D :  Save as .
C :  Yeah , he made it .
B :  Yeah ,
B :  It changes it maybe .
D :  Okay , I will uh
B :  Oh yay .
D :  do the the math .
B :  Oh dear .
D :  Now it's your turn .
A :  Okay , thank you .
A :  We'll see .
B :  Hmm ?
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay , we have now to c uh to calculate the production cost . If it's under uh twelve and half Euro , then it's uh ok uh okay . But i is it if it is b Huh ? No , this isn't right . Okay so , . Redesign . Oh yeah , if they under Yeah .
B :  If they're under twelve fifty .
A :  No .
A :  Oh yeah . Yeah , it's sorry . Yeah , if the costs are under twelve and a half Euro , uh then we uh can uh ra uh move on to the project evaluation , as we have uh experienced it . Otherwise , we have uh do uh have to do a little uh redesign uh thingy . So
B :  Yeah ? Cau 'cause so it's okay .
A :  Uh , we have to fill in the numbers of the component uh components . We have to uh fil uh , want to uh do it in and uh see uh if we stay under the twelve and a half Euro . So , do we have uh a hand dynamo ? No .
C :  No .
A :  That's zero .
C :  Me , too .
B :  Battery , yes . One . One , yeah .
C :  Yes . Yeah .
A :  Battery , one ? Okay .
B :  Kinetic , one . Yeah .
A :  Kinetic , one ? Okay , solar cells , zero . Okay , uh simple chip on print ? No ?
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh , n no .
D :  No .
D :  Advanced chip .
C :  No .
A :  No , advanced chip . Sample sensor sample speaker ?
B :  No .
C :  Yes .
B :  No , the advanced chip is uh
C :  No .
D :  Advanced chip is three .
A :  Three ?
D :  Three Euros , yep .
C :  Uh , we have one . We have one
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah uh , but it it's one one thing , it's three Euro . Uh , what's the sample sensor ?
D :  Okay , one piece , yeah .
C :  .
C :  No , sev zero .
D :  No .
C :  Well , that's um yeah , speech recognition and s
D :  Speech recognition , I think .
B :  Yeah , you give it a sample , uh one .
A :  Okay .
A :  Zero . Uh , uncurved flat . No . But is it s it's not made from a single uncurved thingy and then uh and then uh no ? Okay . So it's only uh once double-curved .
B :  No .
D :  No .
C :  A zero .
D :  No .
B :  You no .
C :  No . No .
D :  Thingy .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yes , three . Eight .
B :  Yeah , 'cause um the layer around it fits around the bubbles on the o on the uh the back of the
A :  Okay . We're now in a problem , 'cause uh we have uh reached eleven Euro yet .
B :  Uh , we don't have anything else . So
D :  Okay , go on . Just go on .
A :  Okay , but uh we have
C :  Just go on . Then we'll see uh we'll we'll see uh wha how much we are over budget .
A :  Okay .
B :  Could you step a little to the right ma Yeah . Oh , sorry .
D :  Two .
D :  Two .
A :  Uh , rubber .
B :  Or
A :  You .
C :  Zero .
B :  And zero .
A :  Titanium , no ?
B :  Special uh is the special colour ? Mm .
A :  Special colour ?
C :  I don't think so . No , this is a standard colour . Yes , this is a special colour .
D :  No .
A :  Yeah , but we want to make uh the wood colours , uh that uh
B :  Yeah . Yeah , if if you're honest , we'll uh type one , special colour .
D :  S
D :  Yeah , but but D but Daniel , tha that's that's another brand . That's another article
C :  That's an add-on .
A :  Yeah , one .
D :  to sell .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but we we going to yeah yeah , that's true . But yeah , it's it's it
B :  Uh , j maybe we'll finish uh the the list first and then look back , aye ?
D :  That doesn't account for this . Producing this .
A :  Okay , the push-button , no .
B :  No . Scroll wheel , no .
A :  Scroll-wheel , no .
B :  No .
A :  No . Oh , no . Yes , one . Uh , button , no . No , the the we don't have a s no . Okay . Oh , okay . So , um what's the thing we can change ?
B : 
B :  One , yeah .
C :  No .
B :  No . Mm , is it No . No .
C :  These three .
D :  No .
C :  Well , we're only four Euro over budget . But
B :  So
C :  Well , other case , we can make it single-curved or uncurved .
B :  No . No .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh , can I uh I say something ? No , can I say something uh as Project Manager ? The kinetic thing , can we just skip it , because uh you have to shake it , but that's not really innovative .
B :  Mm , single-curves .
D :  Yeah , of course .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Just cut off the kine yeah . Or yeah .
C :  Yeah . Okay , sure .
B :  Yeah , we just put a good battery it it . Mobile phones nowadays .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Daniel . Daniel , what do you think about Here . What do you think about uh putting a battery in it , but also selling like uh the covers , a docking station just apart from the from the thing , so that you can uh put uh
A :  Yeah . Yo . Sorry , yeah , yes .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  rechargeable batteries in it and just
A :  Okay .
B :  But you can use rechargeable batteries anyway , just you s you have to recharge them manual .
A :  Yeah , and not really . But we if you forget about the kinetic , well if we do that ,
D :  Yeah , yeah , okay .
D :  Just an idea . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's a cost reduc
C :  Yeah , sure .
A :  we shall .
B :  Ah .
C :  Okay , well you you can go from double-curved to single-curved .
A :  So um
D :  Yeah , of course .
C :  And that would solve the budget problem .
A :  Uh , b but i but the single-curved is just oh
B :  Yeah , so we have to bake the ba back flat , and then
C :  Yeah .
C :  It's just yeah well , the single-curve that
B :  No , it's it's just one curve and not a back uh curved I think . Or
A :  Oh , okay , okay . So that's wh tha that's one option .
C :  Yeah . Exactly , yeah .
B :  Or are these two curves ? Uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  And then w yeah , and then we could have it , but uh it's its' well it's it's r it is the main point of the the the the look .
D :  Yeah ,
D : 
B :  Yeah , but what else uh do we have to cut out ? No advanced chip , uh that's a little bit of problem .
C :  We going to cut
A :  No , tho uh that that can be done . So uh ,
D :  Yeah .
B :  Although , can we make it with a regular chip ?
A :  okay , a little less uh conversation .
B :  Curvy .
D :  Hey , those ar arcs , why are there for ? The blue blue uh
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Fill in Just a
D :  Okay .
B :  Explanation . Twelve fifty . Well
A :  explanation . I can delete it for you if you want .
D :  No , no no .
A :  So , if we do this , uh we're on uh twelve and a half Euro . And we're done .
B :  Yeah , but does it fit with our design ? Do we have to u adapt it ?
A :  Uh well , the only uh thing that don't
B :  It's single-curves .
A :  Yeah , single-curved , but there's a curve in it . So
D :  Yeah .
B :  Could we just make the bubbles uh cut off the back , and then we're uh has
C :  Yeah , we just make it flat . But , you do l
B :  Okay .
D :  But , wha 'Kay , look , what is the uh If you make it double-curved , it costs one Euro more . But
B :  More . Yeah . You make it optional .
D :  No , but
D :  does it have a lot of extra uh fun function more like
C :  Function .
B :  Functional .
C :  Worth , does it have added worth ? No , um
B :  Uh , there's an a a athe aesthetic value , but not functionality .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it's really a static value . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , uh aesthetic .
D :  I mean , uh you make like eleven and a half Euros profit
D :  instead of twelve and a half . But
D :  I don't know if twelve and a half is uh a fixed uh fixed price .
C :  Yeah , well let's assume it is . We we should assume it i that it is . But I I figured that the kinetic would be a marketing promotion . R if you uh promote a kinetic um I kinetic remote control , I mean , that would b sell better than an a normal remote control .
A :  Yeah , it is . Oh .
D :  No , we can't go above that . Yeah ?
A :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , okay . Then it's okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Do you think ? Well , now you can shake your remote control .
D :  Yeah , I think so .
C :  No , well , y I mean uh , y you can go into your neighbour and tell him , ha , my k uh remote control is kinetic . You have standard old battery control uh remote con
A :  Kinetic .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  What a what about all the m the environment freaks ? Not freaks , the envi
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , but it doesn't fit in our co cost profile . So
D :  No . I I think it's it's
C :  True .
D :  It look like this one .
B :  You ma can make an an especialised extra gold version .
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Who because if you want to go to kinetic , you're uh you're on thirteen and a half and you must go to flat , and I think now it's it's more of uh a compromise
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  thing .
A :  And if you make the single curve ha just a big curve ,
A :  then it's uh then it's uh yeah , one big good curve . I was going to uh say nasty words , but I don't . This is strange by the way .
B :  Yeah , just one big curve .
A :  Wood is m is is is cheaper than rubber . We thought that wood would be more expensive .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Uh , this uh American figures . You just cut down some trees .
A :  Yeah , maybe . But uh that this is this is it ? Yeah . Okay , this is it . I'm gonna save it .
D :  This is it .
B :  Whoever makes uh a remote control out of titanium .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  It is possible , but you can't use double uh curves for titanium . That's one of the functionability uh
B :  No .
A :  Okay , well ,
A :  considering we have
D :  Ah no , we have to do all those hours again .
D :  Go back . One back ?
D :  Costs on uh No redesign .
A :  Well , we were above , so we did a little redesign
D :  Yeah .
B :  We sue . We Yeah , we'll start her all o all over again .
D :  Yeah , okay , yeah .
A :  Okay , um now uh it's about time to uh talk about uh this project . Uh , some uh things . Were there uh room for uh was there room for creativity in our meetings or in your individual meetings ?
B :  Um
D :  Hmm .
D :  I I didn't think so . That there was a lot of room for it . But , that's mainly because uh of the information that was delivered to us . It was just fixed information and get your stuff from there , and I couldn't go on on i on the internet and search my own stuff . Bu
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . That's true . I agree with that .
C :  Well , I th I think you two , uh especially you and uh and uh Daniel , you d you you both had uh the less creative uh roles in the project .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . That's true .
B :  For us , there was a lot of creativity . We could just sign up an uh remote if we liked .
C :  'Cause I think m
A :  Yeah . Yeah , that's true .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I think Jeroen and I , we had a more design we could have more we had more room for creativity than than you two .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , that's true .
A :  Okay . Uh how about the leadership ?
B :  Uh
C :  Ha .
D :  Leadership was uh crappy .
B :  Crappy . Cra
C :  Nah , the leadership wasn't crappy , it was the leader that was crappy . Nah . No , the leadership was okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay , thank you very much . Now we're done .
B :  Yeah , example of crappy leadershi
D :  No , leadership was uh
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  Okay , I thought uh the first meeting was a little bit of unstructured meeting . Uh , you could have but uh , it was your first , no uh no disrespect or something , but you could have uh structure it a l little bit more . So like , I I was talking most of the time the first meeting meeting , and Yeah . But
C :  Yeah , it was good .
A :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  Yeah .
B :  You could of said , shut up you fool .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I notice it too . I was a I was also very uh unhappy , uh very unsatisfied uh about the
D :  About me .
A :  about the first meeting . So , uh I hope uh uh the the the other meetings uh
D :  Yeah , you made up .
C :  Try to learn from your mistake . And we will never do it again .
A :  get better and uh I think the the last two meetings uh also we we reached uh some good decisions about uh talk yeah .
D :  No , it you did better .
B :  Yeah , more more consensus . Ev everybody w was agreeing every Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Much more constructive .
A :  Okay , so uh that's cool . Uh , teamwork ? Well , maybe that's uh only Yeah well , it's for us , because uh
B :  Well , we work together on a project , but everybody has his own task . So , it is a little bit
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah and it's wo more like presentation and some points were discussed . But , really teamwork were you two uh
B :  Yeah . No
D :  Two guys .
B :  Well , it went okay .
A :  The
C :  Yeah , that went w it went well . It's it's just uh
A :  Yeah ?
B :  Stupid stupid pen , but uh
A :  No hard feelings .
C :  Nah . Yeah , we we had some trouble with the pen , but
A :  Yeah . Now you you must push a little while .
B :  Yeah , but but draw something uh difficult . D uh just write your name right now . Try to write your name , in in writing letters , of course , yeah ?
C :  Yeah , but us
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , normally , uh this uh the w Block letter sign it , yeah ?
A :  O Just uh okay .
B :  Just just write your name in in one line . If it's a little bit too small bit quicker now . It didn't
A :  You can be you can go quicker , 'cause then it it won't notice it .
B :  Uh he he knows how it works , yeah .
C :  Oh .
A :  I follow the Master class for the SMARTboard , so I think that's the that's the main issue . Um , so uh about this one you were uh you're dealing with , um the the the the digital pen .
D :  Okay .
D :  Means .
B :  Y well , yeah . Th the i
B :  The idea is great , but it doesn't work properly . Uh
A :  Okay . Yeah .
D :  Digital pen , I thought uh th the first time I did individual work , I used it . But , a and the first two meetings I brought it with me , but I didn't use it at all after the first the first meeting .
A :  Yeah .
A :  No .
B :  Yeah .
C :  No , I have it working . But , uh yeah , well uh
D :  It's it's not real real use for me .
C :  No , it doesn't have that much added value to the
A :  Huh .
B :  Nee . As uh as I said a m a c few moments ago , it I would like , myself , to write with a normal pen , because must um
A :  Well
B :  Yeah , it's almost the same concept , but you can just sim more simply put it on our scanner . I it's the same concept as the pen , where you f have to download the software or s uh very uh slow .
A :  Yeah .
A :  M yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And it is still your own handwriting uh popping up in uh Word .
B :  Yes . No , and it doesn't give any added value .
A :  No , uh that's true . No .
D :  Not really , no .
A :  And uh the SMARTboard is uh useful , but the the pen is I uh not user-friendly , I think . Be it it takes a lot of time to draw things and to write things , and that's the
B :  Yeah , not user-friendly .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , and it's it's not very precise . We're trying to m to
D :  Yeah , like when you do this .
B :  Yeah , it may um Yeah , and tr try to wri write your name uh in a in a normal uh size , yeah . Smaller .
D :  Smaller ?
B :  Yeah , smaller . Just like when you're writing on a letter .
A :  Yeah , but that's not th the the you when you at a foreign audience , you b don't gonna wr uh write uh small .
B :  No , a as you saw on on this drawing , just open open this one or that one .
B :  It's uh th it it Yeah , uh we had more problems even here when we trying to draw these buttons , it's almost impossible to get clear uh when you're uh
A :  Yeah .
D :  Oh . Sorry .
A :  But maybe there's some function with no , it isn't . With uh
B :  And the eraser was another problem . It w t is is this large . And when you try to erase this line , y
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well , I'm gonna erase my uh name .
B :  I'm gonna erase my name there .
A :  Yeah , it's a big uh big eraser .
D :  Okay . New ideas ?
B :  M Abo What kind of new ideas ?
A :  Um
A :  Well , the the idea of the touch-screen is uh
D :  Do you ? Go on .
B :  Yeah , uh
A :  I'm just uh
B :  New ideas about uh the working of this software , about about the project , about the remote controls or
D :  Yeah . Mm , yeah , I think so .
A :  I don't know what what I mean .
A :  No . Oh .
B :  Hello .
D :  Did you heard what he said ? I don't I don't know what I mean . Oh , I have some figure . Here . The eva the evaluation , the mm the mean uh number is uh one point eight one point eight six . So that's fairly uh fairly good , I think .
C :  Know what I mean .
A :  Oh yeah .
A :  That's interesting .
A :  Okay , because what does it mean ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  So true .
D :  Uh , that uh
A :  All the mo yeah , are between one and two .
D :  all the requirements uh are true or very true , right . Yep .
A :  Yeah . Oh , okay . Yeah , okay . Thank you , expert . But the new ideas found for uh wi with working with this uh software ?
B :  Not really , just they have to improve it . Uh , the concept is okay , but it has to be quicker . Uh , it is still opening my programme , n almo almost uh my entire computer is locked up during the process and it , yeah , just takes too many time . People will still feel the need to to write it quickly on uh a page and not download it and save it , and
A :  Not really , yeah ?
A :  Yeah , I think
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  You had expected it to to be uh more more uh
B :  More user-friendly . 'Cause when you use a pen , you can just draw like you d draw normally , and you do
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . May maybe the idea you proposed is uh a screen here . And draw it , and it's it's placed over there .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that l
A :  Yeah .
B :  Would be easier . Or at least when you you don't have to adapt to the technology , just you can write in the way you normally write . And now you have to um keep constantly in mind that you're drawing on this screen . And that's a very bad concept .
D :  Hmm ? No .
A :  Yep , yep .
A :  Yeah , that's true .
D :  Ah , very bad . But
B :  Nah , okay , I I it's my opinion that I
D :  I think this is better than regular flip-overs , but
B :  Yeah , it's can be saved easier .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But if you're in normal flip-over you a lot of people write text . There's no text option . And writing text uh , yeah , you've gotta really do your best to write some
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , and and maybe some uh functions for uh uh uh circle or uh a square . You have to draw it yourself now .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Or maybe even insert picture . If you have uh some presentation , and you have some f
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Or text function . Just t t type text , and that that would be uh excellent . Mean
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but insert image isn't available ?
B :  'Cause then you could
D :  Here . Picture from scanner , clip-art .
A :  Yeah , that that can be done already . But not the the the the predefined uh squares I think uh
B :  Oh , okay .
B :  So you can
D :  Hyperlink ?
D :  Hey , what if you do like hyperlink ?
B :  With uh W_W_ dot Google dot com .
D :  Type type it ?
B :  Oh yeah . Maybe .
D :  Re Real Reaction dot N_L_ .
A :  Hmm ?
D :  Yes , is now is okay . Okay ?
A :  Sorry ?
B :  You'll just make a link in
D :  Huh .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Well , that's nice .
B :  There's one way to uh
A :  Is it
D :  'Kay , double-click it .
B :  Maybe if if you're not using the eraser
A :  Here . oh .
D :  You're erasing .
A :  Oh , sorry . Select .
B :  Something else th Yeah , arrow .
D :  Double-click it .
A :  Yeah . Here , that .
B :  Okay . Well , it's
A :  So you have as you saw , you have a little uh
A :  Oh , you can
A :  Yeah , thank you .
A :  You can go uh
B :  Yeah , okay .
A :  there .
A :  So there the the the functionality is there , but it's not it's not ideal , and it's it's very it costs a lot of time to uh
B :  But
B :  .
B :  To use , yeah .
A :  to use . And that's a pity , if you uh if you have uh thirty , forty minutes uh for this kind of things , and we are now with four people , but it well , imagine you are here you're with the ten people and everyone uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . And that's m
B :  That's mostly the case , from the over here with the managements you get two minutes to make your case , and if you have to do all this kind
A :  Yeah . Two minutes of drawing , yeah .
D :  Yep .
B :  You'll rather use PowerPoint and work it out in advance . And th the one or two things you have to draw when you're there , just use a flip-board .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  What I really miss also is uh
D :  is a d is a turtle is a decision uh decision system like um
D :  With the evaluation , you have to
D :  Polls like , what do you want , a one , a two , maybe a a l a little application like uh uh give your own number and click one two three four five six seven .
A :  Yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , just like he said with the with the a screen which you can write , also uh a kind of voting uh mechanism .
D :  Yeah , j ju ju yeah , v voting application . Just a little group group decision application .
C :  Oh .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  But uh , problem is , well you can't discuss anything well you you ca uh you can , but you will discuss a lot less than l like we did now . We I mean uh w w w one one person s maybe said three . But , well uh I we said uh , no I w th think two , because this and this , and then you can react uh on it . But if you you put a three on it , uh just figure well , everybody knows what I'm knowing , so they'll all just put a two on .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Yeah , of course . But , uh you can still discuss about it , but but click it in an application , that's a lot easier to process .
C :  Yeah , but it would yeah .
C :  Yeah okay , the for processing part . But then uh , I think the idea of one person entering it and the rest uh discussing it , that uh isn't that bad idea , actually . Not that your opinion isn't valued , but but still .
D :  The digit . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Okay , so
D :  Okay . That's it ?
B :  Okay . Yo , manager . When are w
A :  Uh well , just about , because uh
B :  When are we going to produce it ?
A :  Yeah , tomorrow ? Uh , the costs are within the budget . Uh , the project is evaluated . But , before we going to celebrate , uh I have uh a little question which you can't answer , because uh there must be some kind of end report . I am busy with the end report right now . You might thinking what the hell was he doing uh
D :  Celebration .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  What is an end report ?
A :  Uh about all the meetings , what we have decided , a r r a report of this day . Uh , that must be made , but I don't know , here is uh standing uh whoa , we can celebrate now , but the end report is
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Oh , you ha you have ten minutes left , I uh read .
B :  Oh .
D :  You have now ten minutes left to finish up the end report .
A :  Okay well , that uh that can be done . Maybe we can do it uh together . You can see what I've uh yeah ? So I I s I will uh put it on a story-board .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , sure .
A :  You can see it .
D :  Um
A :  Because I think it will uh it must be uh
D :  You you already made a beta version , or
A :  Yeah , it's a three uh with seventy five uh
D :  Pages .
A :  Yeah , just about . Well , just a moment . End report .
C :  Y yikes . Seventy five pages .
D :  Okay , Daniel .
D :  Do you want a chair maybe ?
B :  A chairman .
D :  Hey ?
A :  No no no , I'm just uh you can s you can read it and uh here here it is . End report .
D :  Oh , okay .
C :  So you you finished it actually , and so we just have to read it and say yes or no ?
B :  Yes .
A :  Well , this not nit it read-only . But it's not uh fully finished yet .
D :  Five minutes for finishing .
A :  Um , this is about the functional design , the things yeah yeah . Oh yeah . I'm uh when I said it , I remember I had it here .
D :  Management Expert , you have to change that .
D :  Marketing .
B :  It's a read-only version .
D :  Yeah , but you can save it u the under another name .
B :  Oh , okay .
A :  Marketing Expert , okay . Um
A :  about the three functions where uh which are most used and uh which must uh immediately be visible on our uh remote control . Um , it must be uh simple to use , very clear what to do , and at the younger people . So , this is really about wh uh what kind things uh must be in it and uh yeah .
D :  Maybe um the
D : 
B :  Uh
D :  The
A :  Yeah , I understand you , I can talk a little bit Dutch .
D :  Yeah .
D :  You Yeah . No , you have to put uh , switch channels uh at the top , because that's the most used function and teletext at the second
A :  Oka okay , okay , I
A :  I really didn't knew that .
D :  Oh nay , a volume changing , second .
A :  So , this one's first .
D :  S switch , yes .
A :  You go there and you go there . So , okay . Well , maybe I can then do it one two three .
D :  Yeah . Okay , go on .
D :  Yes , very good .
B :  One two three .
A :  If the order is in uh is is uh important , that's the word for . Uh ,
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  The order .
A :  then the conceptual design . Uh , well all the things we have uh discussed , uh the energy , which uh turn out to be uh batteries , so that's
B :  Yeah . Well , okay , maybe you can add it later that we decided in the end because of the cost .
A :  Yeah , because yeah . Uh , he here it is still double-curve , the rubber , the flashy , the fruity , the removable . Uh , the buttons Hmm ?
D :  Single-curves .
C :  It's not double . Uh , it's not double anymore , eh ?
B :  A single-curved .
A :  Not double anymore . Nay but that this is what um
D :  No , okay .
C :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Was initial , the plan . The initial plan .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And the the added functions like Tetris snake , it's under the parental control , the touch-screen . So , it's uh just a summary of what uh we had discussed uh
C :  On thing uh
C :  One small thing uh , the added functions . Uh , was it included in the cost ? I don't think so , eh ?
B :  Ah , it's very cheap .
C :  It's very cheap .
A :  Uh , it's very cheap , you you maybe you you you you come at uh
D :  No , it's it's not very cheap , but that no , but it's a development inside corporation . Like , uh w we don't have to buy parental control . Our own people can make that , I think . Yeah , it it has some cost , but
A :  It's very necessary .
A :  Yeah , but it still has some yeah . Okay , but so we can discuss that uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  He'll do it in his free time . So uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  we can discuss that kind of things I think with the
A :  with the the board of uh
B :  Of directur or directors .
A :  What's it what's the company called ? I just keep forgetting it .
D :  Real Reaction .
A :  Real Real Reaction .
D : 
B :  Yeah .
A :  Real Reaction , yeah . Okay , so uh anybody uh misses something here about uh
B :  You can ask your personal
B :  Yeah , the end conclusion . But uh
A :  Yeah , okay , that's that's what I'm gonna write b between now . But , i in here nothing uh
D :  Okay . Still the end conclusion . That's all , I think .
B :  Um , the decision to make um the buttons on the top , and the menu on the
A :  Mm-hmm . Yes .
B :  on the bottom . And clearly Yeah , touch-screen you've mentioned .
A :  Yeah , touch-screen I've mentioned .
D :  Yeah , but but the the decisions are put in the uh conclusion , I think . Why we decided to use a flat uh L_C_D_ .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay , this n yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay , well I gonna redesign uh something now . No .
D :  Yeah . Um
B :  Party party .
A :  Because I think it will Oh , five minutes from to finish meeting .
B :  Oh , before you change anything maybe you um save it first .
D :  Save it .
D :  Hmm .
B :  You can't you can select file and export and then those J_ PEG files .
D :  Yeah , but then you had the same thing .
B :  Well , eight . And we have uh , another blank one .
D :  Example of children remote . Oh wait . Wait .
B :  Did we change anything ?
B :  Wow .
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's a new uh commercial logo .
D :  Hmm .
D :  That's a pity .
B :  Don't save it , aye ?
A :  Oh , that's cool , Tim .
B :  Uh ,
A :  Finish meeting now . Well , I'm I'm
B :  why are only the first five SMARTboard files
A :  I'm going to finish my end report .
B :  saved ?
C :  Okay , um hereby is the meeting is finished .
D :  You declare .
A :  I am the one who can say that . Yeah ? Hereby the meeting is finished . Yeah .
A :  Okay , welcome to the detailed design meeting .
A :  Again , I'm gonna take minutes . Oh , we're gonna have a prototype presentation first . Uh , who's gonna give the prototype presentation ? You two guys ? Okay . Go ahead .
C :  Yes .
C : 
B :  .
D :  .
B :  coffee .
C :  'Kay , we've made a prototype . Um , we've got uh
C :  uh our aspects from the last meeting . Uh , especially we looked at the form , material and the colour . Um , we've uh drawn here the p prototype . The logo is uh
C :  is uh
C :  is pretty uh obvious to see on the on the remote control , but
C :  it is necessary when you want to build your uh company f to a level higher .
C :  Um ,
C :  our interface elements , there are shown in the in the drawing . Maybe you can uh point them uh
B :  Uh , well the uh all the functions are discussed uh I think the most of the functions are uh uh obvious . Uh , it's a little bit . Uh , power button .
C :  The functions .
B :  Uh then the the the nine uh channels .
B :  Uh the volume uh
B :  uh at the side , and the other side is the programmes . And then we had uh just uh two buttons , we place them in the middle , uh the menu , and for the teletext I thought that was th
A :  Oh no , the the the mute button misses now . Do y do you did we want to have a m mute button ?
D :  Alright , I
B :  Oh , the mute button .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But uh that It's uh here then , in the middle .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Huh .
D :  Alright , and uh you gotta point out which is the volume um uh button and which is the programme button .
C :  Yes , um
C :  we've disc
B :  Well , yeah mo uh mo Yeah , well most of them are right-handed .
D :  Yeah , but you you gotta make it clear on the on
C :  Most of the users
C :  Yes , y there there will be a p a little a little P_ on that and a little uh yeah .
B :  Yeah well , I don't have time in uh anymore on the
D :  Yeah , and a and a triangle on that .
B :  Oh yeah , just progr programme above , I think .
D :  Yes . Next to that I kinda miss a zero actually .
A :  Wait , there's was one thing I wanted to ask . Uh , there are different ways for remote controls to uh do uh like
A :  uh d I call it teens and twenties . Uh , y th th th the two numbers .
C :  Yes .
D :  All n no , that's um kinda dependent on the television .
B :  Yeah , true , yeah .
C :  It's a television . Yes .
B :  Uh
A :  Yeah , but do we have do we need extra buttons , for example some uh some have to
D :  I think
B :  Uh I think so .
C :  Yes , yes , you have you have a lot of standard buttons that has to be uh on it , uh th with the one and a double uh uh yes .
D :  Yeah , I think you should add
B :  Zero ?
D :  A cross , or whatever . Yeah , line .
B :  May maybe here ?
A :  Yeah , but you don't you don't actually need them , becau b l a lot of remote controls work that y when y that you when you fir you push the one first , then you have a couple of seconds No , I don't think so .
B :  Yeah .
B :  And then a second .
D :  No , that's dependent on the television .
C :  Yes , you have televisions , then you have to , you know , you have to uh press
D :  I do know so .
B :  Is it depending on television ?
A :  Nah , I don't think so really , because you have a I know some remote controls that don't have these buttons , but you still can , know , obviously you can still select the twenty uh a number in the twenty or in the ten .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , but but a lot uh
D :  Yes , but uh uh no uh remote control nowadays are um they come with the television . Or actually , the other way around . But
A :  No , I think uh I really think it's n because you can when when you put a button on it with like one and uh then a dash , it's the same thing as when you just push the one , because it i it first gives you the functionality of that that uh separate button you also had to uh apply .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , but
D :  Yeah , well but su If
C :  some televisions don't accept uh that that
A :  Yeah , because that's i it's for television . It's exact the same thing .
C :  No , no , but s
D :  No no no . So some television respond differently . Look , if uh i i
A :  No , listen listen . When you push the button , the remote control gives a signal . I in th in the first place it gives a signal which it would also send when you put a separate button on it . The one with dash , that signal gi and when y whe when you don't push another button on the remote control within five seconds , then the remote control gives a signal for channel one .
D :  Yes .
D :  Yes , that's true .
B :  Yeah .
B :  True .
D :  No
A :  I think it works that way , really .
D :  No , it it it works uh if you haven't got uh a special button for it , uh if you push a one , then on your television there will appear a one and a a line , which is an empty space .
A :  Yeah , but it's exact the same that w would appear when you put a separate button push a separate button .
C :  Yes , but some some old televisions uh you have to uh click on uh a special button , uh then you go to a a next level , you can push two buttons .
A :  Yeah , but you don't underst uh you don't understand my point . I think it's exact the same thing when y
D :  Yep . True .
C :  You want
C :  Yes , but some television don't support it .
A :  No , but then they would a would also support that button , because it's the same thing . Listen , with that that's that special but button you're talking about , eh ? That's just a signal to recei ju they send a t signal to the v tv T_V_ that they have to put a one in on your screen and a dash , which you can pu so you can uh still put another number on it . When you don't have that separate button , and you push y one , it's exactly the same thing . Do y you the remote control gives that same signal as it would give when you only had
B :  But the ex
D :  No , s some some televisions need the input first uh and and you c
C :  No , a remote can
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , so they need no , they need
A :  But you give the input . You push the one . That's the same thing as the button with the one and it yes it it is . Think about it .
D :  No , that's not true . It's simply not true . It's simply not true . Uh
B :  Yeah . You uh you can wai when you push the one you can show on the telly a one and just a dash , and then wait uh two uh seconds or something
C :  No , but uh
A :  And it's the same thing what happens and a g remote control gives another signal after five seconds that is just one .
D :  No , remote control doesn't give signal after five seconds . Remote control is a stupid thing . If you push a button , it sends it immediately to to the television .
A :  Yeah , that's true . Yeah , but I m uh but it's I I know for sure that some televisions that w th th the remote control supplied , only ha has the c these buttons with a one and a dash and a two and a dash , but when you use a bu a n remote control that doesn't sport these buttons , it still works . But okay , we we'll impl
C :  Yeah , it
D :  No , definitely not . Definitely not .
B :  We'll discuss them in the usability lab .
A :  No , we'll apply them then for now .
B :  Uh eva evaluation . I don't know uh I don't know if if it's it's necessary .
A :  Yeah , app just apply them next to the zero , the one and the two . Yeah , I think so . Yeah , for now , if we don't know for sure whether
B :  Yeah ?
B :  Okay .
C :  And the button for the SCART uh audio video uh external input .
D :  Yes .
B :  Ach .
A :  Yeah but okay . What I said about uh the remote control sending another signal , that that might not be true , but I still think i it it all T_V_s in some ways support it , I don't know . I think it's more c is m maybe we don't uh we both don't really understand how it i how it really works , but I think there's more to in than wha than what you just said .
D :  Uh , you can access that uh via zero , and then minus , I guess . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  No , no .
C :  Uh , remote control sends one signal at one button uh press .
A :  I do think that uh m T_V_s support mur multiple kind of remote controls . M
C :  Uh , some
C :  N some televisions when when you want to go further than uh ten
A :  Th won't work wi with uh to have that special button .
C :  No , you have to you have to uh give the television uh two or more signals . When you uh press one button , you give one signal . And the older televisions need more signals to go a level higher .
C :  But
D :  Yep .
A :  Okay , well we'll see .
C :  When you make the technology that that it will uh give more signals ,
C :  it could work , but
C :  Just a basic idea of of of the most uh most y
C :  most common uh and simple uh operations on the remote .
D :  Okay . I kinda miss the docking station .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes . It's here on the
B :  Well it yeah , uh there's nothing I think it's pretty basic , the the there's no fu there's one there's one button , that's wha there's there's there's one function and that's n the one button when you want to find it .
C :  We came uh
C :  Yes .
D :  No nothing really trendy about it .
C :  But maybe we can maybe we can make the docking station uh uh a bit standard for for uh the other products we sell , because Real Real Reaction sells more products than only remote controls . So maybe we can uh use the docking station , for example , uh M_P_ three players or or uh
D :  The button .
D :  Yep .
C :  uh hearing devices .
D :  I think that's very difficult , because of different shapes of uh uh devices .
C :  Yes , but when you put that same volt voltages on it , you can put uh when the when the when uh o the the the lowest part of it , when it's o the same as the other products , you can put it all on the same uh
D :  Yeah , of course .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well it it got it it has got to fit into the shape , of course .
C :  Yes , but we can make
D :  The technology and the voltage can be the same . That's uh that's true . But uh i if you all make the m having a bottom like this , then they all fit .
C :  No , we can make uh make the most lowest part all the same .
D :  Yeah , that's true , but uh
C :  When when the the recharger has a has a bit what points out , we can place all on top of it .
D :  Yes , but uh I I g
C :  Just have to be big enough for the biggest
D :  Shouldn't it fall then ? It isn't going to fall down ? That's a bit uh yeah , I think
C :  No , when you make it large enough no it it will not . But then it's a little bit
D :  No , but if if like this , I'll I'll point it out , if you got uh a a a base a base like this , I won't draw it really . If you got a base which is uh as big as this
C :  But it's just an idea .
C :  But it's flat it's flat as as this , so we can p make all the products as flat as this .
B :  You can .
D :  Yeah sure , but if you got if you got a tiny player , it can
B :  But i i i it's backwards .
C :  Yes , but when you make uh uh a bit of big
B :  But it's it's backwards . It's leaning . It's leaning backwards , I think , in the in the docking station .
D :  Yeah . Uh , wha what you could do if you uh from the bottom oh , right , help . Uh , you could make like a hole in it , you know , of uh in in the
B :  That's text .
A :  But
C :  Yes , little holer littler Uh , little products go deeper in it .
D :  Yeah . That i that is possible , yep .
A :  Well let's ha let's talk about the docking station later , because uh maybe we have we have to uh consider the docking station anyway , because we have some uh cost issues still to come . But we have to look n I don't know .
D :  Yeah , sure , you're right .
C :  Yes . And uh uh
D :  Oh .
C :  the f the look and feel would be great on this uh remote control , because uh you always uh will uh pick up the remote control in the in the smallest uh area . Then your uh left thumb of uh your right thumb is uh near the programme uh button ,
D :  I don't like the colours .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  which is the most common used uh function , and all the other buttons are available for your uh thumb .
C :  So it's it's it's really good design .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . Alright .
A :  Yes . That's it ?
C :  Yes , uh on the side uh there will be a strip of rubber , and in the middle uh there is uh a hard uh a hard material , a bit hard plastic with a light uh behind it .
D :  The light .
D :  Okay . And other lights ?
A :  I think added lights are gonna be a problem too .
C :  Yes , we can make also n neon lights on it , or or the buttons that can make uh light on it .
D :  No , o on the on the front .
D :  Yeah , okay . Maybe the uh the logo .
C :  Yes .
B :  lights ?
C :  But , it will also uh uh use batteries , and do we want to
D :  Yeah , why not ?
D :  Of course .
A :  Okay . For now , uh this is uh is good enough .
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , what was uh on the
C :  The all the aspects of the interface buttons were uh
A :  Okay , but in the oh yeah , the colour , because we're gonna use uh one colour for the the plastic enclosure and one colour for the rubber , isn't it ? Then we're gonna do the buttons in the i are we're gonna have rubber buttons . And they're be a they'll be in the same colour as the rubber on the side . Okay . And I think we should use a a darker colour for the um plastic , and maybe some more m brighter and flashy stuff
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh , in the same colour as the side .
B :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think I think that'll be good .
C :  Yes , maybe we can use on the on the lights on the side we can use uh uh multiple uh lights , so it will uh
D :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , we'll talk about the lights later . 'Cause I also don yeah , it's depends on the costs and such . But uh , and we have to agree uh upon the exact colours , but may I dunno if that's important , but we'll talk about that later . Okay , for now this is this is okay . Um , the next p y you gonna give a presentation too ? Uh , I have to see the agenda .
C :  Yes .
D :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
D :  We will .
D :  Well , uh yeah , I I'm gonna do something right there , yeah .
C :  No .
A :  Detail design .
D :  We gotta do that on the right the most right-most screen , because the leftmost
A :  Evaluation criteria .
D :  Yep , that's me .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Alright . I will be needing that image , so leave it please . Um
D :  Go away .
D :  Right , we're gonna evaluate that design according to a few points . Um , we g the four of us are going to do that um together . I wanna have a colour over here , come on . Right , the remote is not ugly , a bit weird sentence , but
D :  the positive things has to be on the left , so I said not ugly instead of ugly . Uh , what would you say , we we gotta give points to uh to all of these to evaluate uh that design , and please forget the drawing skills of these guys . The remote control is not ugly . How do you feel ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , I think four maybe would be appropriate , because it's
A :  Yeah , maybe it really depends on taste . Uh , I mean it's kind of , our design . It's so if maybe a lot of people find it really ugly , you know , o other people find it really cool . I don't know or uh I don't know how you
D :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Background colour .
D :  How do you guys feel ?
C :  I think I think the the fronts will give it a more uh uh uh less uglier uh side , because you can uh make it in your own yes , you can make it in your own uh
A :  Casting . Yeah .
D :  The different designs . Yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  more to your own personality or or house style .
A :  Yeah , but we d we didn't we're we're not planning to use fronts , I believe . With a colour a co a colours . Oh , okay .
D :  No , not not fronts , but different designs .
B :  No , not fronts . Different designs . Different colours maybe , yeah .
C :  Yes .
D :  And that's still uh uh , yeah , is is uh is a little personal touch , I guess . What ?
A :  Okay , but
A :  Oh , maybe we should do three or something that w you know , our
D :  Yeah , wha wha what would you uh guys uh think ? Personally .
C :  Or forty .
A :  Yeah .
B :  We can make it a one .
D :  Personally .
D :  Yes , but what is it ?
C :  I think two or three .
B :  Mm yeah .
D :  Guido ?
B :  I agree .
D :  Two or three .
B :  Um , I uh I go for the positive . So I go for two .
D :  I was
D :  I was thinking about three , so I guess
A :  Uh , I was thinking about four , so I think three is uh
D :  three is uh a bit uh oh , what am I doing ? I'll mark it . The remote control's uh uh that n makes uh zapping easy .
B :  Okay , three .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah well , let that let's make that a one .
C :  Yes .
B :  Two .
D :  Yeah ? Antek , you agree ?
B :  One . One . Okay yeah , I'll I'll agree .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes .
D :  Yeah . You're not Antek .
A :  That's one thing for sure .
B :  I'm the I'm the usability , so
D :  I totally agree . The remote control the remote control's relevant buttons are prominently visible .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , two or a one , I guess . It's something we really put work into .
B :  The
D :  Yeah , I yeah . I would say a one because uh every button is uh uh relevant . And our oh yeah , it's a b yeah . Yeah ? Alright . That's a one ? You agree ?
C :  It's all about the buttons .
A :  Yeah .
D :  The remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons . I think we totally succeeded there . Oh
A :  But
B :  Well
A :  Well maybe a two , because of the menu button or something . And telete
B :  Yeah , well menu Yeah , maybe .
D :  Yeah , that's true . That's true .
C :  Also , the the the buttons of the one , the two , the the digits , o they're used uh uh
A :  Yeah , we don't know if the uh they're necessary .
D :  the the yeah , m well , you d you've got a point .
A :  I think a two .
B :  Yeah , true . Yeah , I agree .
C :  Can yes , three , two .
A :  Came a long way , but not we didn't not uh
D :  Two or three ?
B :  Mm two .
D :  Two ? Antek .
C :  But you can't make a remote control without them , because
B :  Because we got
D :  Nay that that that's true , that's true . They're definitely needed . So
A :  No , w w it can also always be more simplistic , but two is yeah .
D :  we put it on a two ?
C :  Yes .
D :  The remote control has got a really trendy look .
C :  Yes . A one .
D :  Maarten .
A :  Yeah , uh a t I think a two . Yeah yeah , y i it's hard to say from this picture .
B :  Well .
D :  Yeah .
C :  We we've tried to make it uh the the best trendy look uh ever .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Ever , yeah . Guido .
A :  But I do think it's more
B :  Uh , I will I will make it a three , because uh yeah . I I th
A :  But I do think that it's more trendy than beautiful .
D :  Yeah , uh I agree . I agree .
C :  Yes .
A :  So so I think maybe it has to score higher uh on this than on the
B :  Yeah . True , yeah .
D :  I was planning to give it a two , uh where I give the not ugly uh oh , yeah , that's true . You agree on the two ?
A :  A th a three .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
A :  I i uh when you compare to the
D :  Great . Remote control hasn't got too much redundant or unneeded buttons .
A :  Uh uh what's the difference with
D :  Uh , I copied that one .
D :  Well , uh forget that . Um
A :  Okay .
D :  Go away . Remote control has got innovative technology implanted .
B :  No . We're not well , maybe the the the on the side .
C :  No .
A :  No .
C :  No , not L_C_D_ , so .
A :  Yeah , but we uh you mean the rubber stuff ? Yeah , but we have t we have to talk about the lights uh . And I don't u also it's also really not innovative , it's more
D :  Yeah , and the light .
B :  And the light maybe .
C :  But that that's not innovative . Lights lights are
B :  But
D :  Well , I g
D :  It's not seven ?
A :  No , six . Or seven maybe , yeah . Or six .
B :  Well , six .
B :  No , six .
C :  Six .
D :  Why uh why not a seven ?
B :  Six .
A :  Yeah , mine is seven .
C :  Because we've tried to make it a little bit innovative , but it but it
B :  Yeah .
D :  How ?
A :  Uh it's uh depends on the on the maybe
C :  With the lights it it's it's kind of future
B : 
A :  No , I think I think actually it's a seven maybe , but there's nothing innovative about it .
D :  Yeah , you think the lights are innovative ?
D :  Well , it's n true . Uh , I agree , m but
C :  But still you can retrieve it when it's when it's gone , with the with
B :  Innovative in generally or just f original for
D :  I'll
D :  Yeah , you you didn't draw the docking station .
C :  Yes . The docking station is a is a little bit innovative . It's a part of the remote . And with the speaker on the there's also a speaker .
A :  N no no , t .
D :  Yeah , it it's I think I think with its
B :  A docking station is innova
A :  Yeah , I mean the dock station , but but uh , I think the the docking station , it's gonna be a kind of a problem . But
D :  I think more m
B :  Okay .
D :  Uh that that's n
A :  Well , let's leave it open for uh for us later to see what , because we have to reevaluate anyway . Well I i yeah . No ?
C :  Okay .
D :  No uh , well , the agenda says evaluate now , so I think we
A :  Okay , for now it's a six or a seven uh , sev six maybe , because
D :  It's it's a six .
B :  Six .
C :  But the retrieval or the
D :  That m f Yeah , for the retrieval function .
A :  Yeah , but I don't I don't know if it's very inno yeah .
D :  Yeah . I think that's very innovative for a remote control .
C :  Yes , how would you innovate a remote control more ?
A :  Yeah , v
A :  Yeah , more through uh like function T_V_ functionalities and no no , you know what I mean . You have must be innovative technology for remote controls , but more in how you control stuff , not in how you find your yeah . Yeah , it's that's that's think about it la later on and uh
C :  To put it on your head .
D :  Yeah sure , but
D :  But I d I definitely don't think it's a five , but
D :  Remote control is easy to use .
A :  Yeah , as a a one or a two ma uh at least .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , a two .
C :  Yes .
D :  I think a two . Yeah ?
A :  Yeah , it's good .
B :  More two .
D :  Come on . The remote control hasn't got uh .
A :  No , I would have seen that one before . Oh , you skipped one uh
D :  I've just filled uh
A :  Uh , here .
D :  Go away .
C :  You like the buttons .
D :  I found twelve questions so much , but it still is ten .
A :  Remote control will be bought by
D :  It will be bought by people under the age of forty .
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah . Definitely .
B :  Yes .
A :  Well
C :  In in and comparing with uh people of th of the age above ?
D :  No no no . No , just if they if they buy it .
A :  Uh , just in general . Yeah , a two .
C :  We don't know . But
A :  Yeah , but I think I think two .
D :  Yeah , what do you think ?
B :  Yeah , I think two , yeah . I agree . Two .
D :  Antek ?
C :  Yes , two , but only in c when you compare it with with elderly .
A :  Uh , that is not the question . It's just w it will be bought by people under forty .
D :  No , that's no comparison .
A :  Yeah , you can yeah , you can be very picky about it .
D :  And I don't mean two people .
C :  This is just guessing .
A :  Ah yeah , just make it we'll make it a two .
C :  Make it a two .
D :  W w
C :  When it succeeds , uh it can get a two , mu
D :  Right , the rem
D :  The remote control has recognisable corporate image , colour , logo or slogan .
A :  Oh no .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , you have make an slogan is quite obvious .
B :  We don't have the slogan though .
D :  Oh , the slogan . Can we see the slogan ?
A :  Oh the oh sorry , no , not not the slogan . Yeah , you can put that on the side if if we would like to .
B :  The logo .
C :  A logo .
B :  Underneath it or something .
C :  Yes , uh encrypted uh with
A :  Yeah , and I will I th still think it's gonna be a two or a three . Maybe a three this time .
D :  Are we gonna do that ?
B :  A three . Three .
B :  Yeah , a three .
C :  Yes .
D :  Three ? I agree .
D :  Because of the slogan Remote control's got a basic design intended uh for novice users .
A :  And uh
A :  Uh , it's a one or a two .
B :  Yeah , two .
C :  Yes .
D :  Two ? Two . Alright .
A :  Yeah , make it a two .
B :  Two .
D :  We gotta add up the scores now to see our total average . Four , five , seven , nine . Forget that . Fifteen , seventeen , twenty one , twenty four , twenty six .
D :  Twenty six .
D :  It's a two point six .
A :  It's not that bad . Yeah , and that's mostly the inno when we uh score higher on innovative technology , we would score two ,
D :  Alright , we yeah .
D :  Yeah . True .
A :  which is uh quite a great score . Okay . Uh , this is was uh the evaluation ?
D :  This was my evaluation . So
A :  Because I I still think that the most important part of this meeting still has
D :  We did a pretty nice job until now .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Um , is this your
C :  Is there something after this uh meeting ? Or
D :  Whatever .
D :  Well , I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire .
B :  No .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Still opened or uh
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , finance . Because um
B :  Shoot .
A :  I received uh a spreadsheet .
D :  A five . A five .
A :  Yeah , but I uh actually don't need this presentation , I guess . Oh .
D :  Doesn't matter .
A :  I'm gonna open the spreadsheet and we're gonna work this out together , because I didn't really fin uh I have a .
A :  Didn't really finish it .
A :  Well , we uh We'll see . We'll stumble upon some problems .
D :  We probably will .
A :  I probably have already opened it here .
A :  try it again . First of all , the mm all the docking station and costs and such are not included in this list .
A :  But let's let's st start with beginning . We include one battery . I i uh I'll explain its Uh , the the components are listed over here . Uh , price is given . We um yeah , we we uh indicate the amount of components of the specif specific component , how much we need of them . And then uh , we'll uh calcula Don't watch the number yet . I don't know if it's filled in properly . Okay , we need one battery . One battery . I think one battery is enough . We don't need kinetic , solar cells , hand dynamo . A s okay , this this is a p first problem . Uh , I think
D :  The amount , yeah .
C :  Yes .
A :  we should know how many
A :  simple chips , regular chips
C :  Uh it's it's one one chip , but but you have to choose one from it .
A :  Okay .
A :  But
C :  The simple chip is e enough I I think , but with the lights with the lights and the retrieval , it can be uh
D :  I don't know
A :  Where did we find this information ? Was it
D :  I haven't got an idea on on which we need to use , really .
C :  No , uh I
A :  I think it was uh your job in the first uh meet Uh , f your first presentation to make this clear , but then you had some t time problems . But do you th you do you know what chip we need ?
B :  No .
C :  Yes , my my my uh
D :  Yeah .
C :  The the email I got said uh simple chip , but when we put in the speaker and the retriever uh device , it will uh cost a a bit more , like I think the advanced chip maybe .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And how do you know ? I mean , you got that email . Did it point out what to use them for ?
C :  Bec No , the they didn't know about a retriever or a speaker uh in it .
A :  Maybe you can uh look it up right now .
A :  Okay , but okay . When we don't when we leave the uh retriever and such aside , what then it would be a simple chip . And with the retriever , it would be an advanced chip .
C :  Then it's a simple chip .
C :  Yes , I I I s I
D :  Alright , well , point out the advanced chip for now , I guess .
A :  Okay . Yeah , but it will it will it will be cause a lot of problems . The sample sensor sample speaker . What is it m is that the speaker we were t I don't know what it is .
C :  That will be enough for future uh recommendations .
C :  I don't know it uh either .
D :  I don't know .
A :  Okay , we went for the double-curved case
C :  Yes .
A :  made out of plastic
A :  and rubber .
A :  And with a special colour .
A :  I guess that's what we were
B :  Well , special colour . .
A :  Yeah , I don't know about the special colour , but I think w uh
C :  Otherwise , you get uh a standard uh plastic colour .
D :  I don't know if it's very special .
B :  I don't
A :  Yeah , I think we uh we have special colours .
B :  Mm okay .
C :  Standard rubber .
D :  Alright , that's okay .
A :  Okay , then the push-button , I was just counting them . Uh , I think you have to indicate the amount of push-buttons we want to use , isn't it ?
C :  St
B :  Whoa , it's a little
C :  Yes .
A :  Well that's bit of a problem , because I re but I really don't understand that , because I can imagine a remote control with far more push-buttons , and it wouldn't be possible according to this uh sheet .
B :  That's huge .
B :  No . We have the simplest buttons .
D :  No .
C :  No , it's only uh when you use push-buttons , it will cost that much . If you use a scroll-wheel
A :  Yeah .
D :  I don't think so , because it says amount . The the the yellow row is the amount of
A :  Ah .
A :  Yeah , it wouldn't
A :  Fill in the number of components you plan to use in the and the total cost I don't know .
C :  Maybe it's the kind of push-buttons . You can have f four kind of push-buttons .
B :  Uh , one til nine . Is that one or is that nine buttons ?
C :  Rubber . You can have uh
A :  And I count them like this .
A :  One two three uh four five six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve and thirteen . Because Oh , this is oh , this is one , okay . Twelve , okay , then it would be eighteen , because uh , I uh rated them as uh um
B :  Yeah .
D :  To n that's total of four buttons .
A :  as uh uh uh separate buttons . Yes . And plus these two , f uh plus the mute button , and it's will be uh eighteen .
C :  Different , yes .
D :  I think that
D :  Eighteen . One two three four five , si
C :  Why is that so uh expensive .
A :  Yeah , I don't understand . Y I do I don't get the point , because it's would be
A :  s relatively so expensive , just these m small buttons .
B :  Is it cents , the the the fifty cents a button ?
D :  Fifty cents for one single stupid button .
C :  So , whe when you so then it
B :  No way .
A :  Well , okay , well well let's make it just one .
C :  It's eighty percent of the price of the of the amount of
A :  Here , now it's now it's already s shall we just
D :  Yeah , exactly . Yeah .
A :  give our own interpretation to , because else we would really have a problem . It would be impossible to make it
D :  I can't I I I couldn't understand it if it was fifty cents per uh uh per button . Really .
B :  It's way
C :  When you have the same amount of button , you have to put in wi in your carton . Board . And then throw it
A :  And and less buttons than this isn't possible . This is the most simple yeah , it is possible , but I've never seen one before .
D :  Yeah , yeah ,
B :  No , no no .
C :  But whe
C :  I've seen one uh one remote control with only the pu yeah , only with uh page up , page down and volume , but but
D :  No , really .
A :  Yeah , without the numbers . That's possible .
B :  Yeah , uh
A :  Yeah , we could skip the numbers .
D :  Yeah , but I d I wouldn't want to own that . Really .
B :  That's still four .
C :  Uh , it's it's still for little children . They can handle that remote control , but but it isn't fo
D :  Yeah .
A :  Then uh , teletext would also be im impossible .
C :  Yes , it's for it's li uh it's just for a little
B :  Yeah , that's no option , that's no option .
A :  Okay , we'll we'll just okay . But then still , when we there's no room for a docking station or something . Tha w Le let's see th we have uh oh yeah , button supplements . We'll give the buttons special colour . We'll give them a special form . Uh , I think we should mark the special form thing , because it this will be some special forms incorporated in these big buttons , I guess .
B :  A special colour , why a special colour ?
A :  Because the buttons will be uh d will be matching colour between the buttons and the rubber surroundings . I think that's the what they mean by a special colour . I think all the special colour things have to be marked over here , because that's what we were planning to do , making it
B :  But wha what s what special ?
C :  Otherwise , it
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  I don't think the special form is really true .
C :  Otherwise it would be the
B :  Uh , yeah .
C :  Special form also , it says .
A :  Yeah , special material r also , because i has rubber . And the buttons have to be rubber .
D :  Is it ?
C :  What is the normal material ?
D :  Yeah , I dunno .
B :  Plastic .
C :  Sh yeah .
B :  Plastic , I think .
C :  Classic ? Oh , plastic .
B :  Plastic .
D :  Plastic .
A :  'Kay , but the problem now is that the
A :  There's no such thing as a docking station in this list , but we can all imagine that it would be impossible to make a docking station for thirty cents .
B :  Yeah .
C :  But we can uh sell the remote control and uh sell the docking station yes . And and but we don't have to tell it , but what we can say of can um almost make it impossible to buy a remote control without the docking station .
A :  Separately .
B :  Se no no no .
A :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah , but I do like the idea , but we yeah . It uh but it then the docking station isn't relevant for this project anymore , but we can but then you still have to use we have to find out what chip we u need .
D :  No .
C :  No , but you otherwise you can't retrieve it .
D :  Yeah , I really don't get it . I mean if it's a simple chip , then we suddenly got two Euros and thirty cents .
A :  I think we can agree on this . I I think the special colour thing has to be uh marked .
A :  'Cause I think we uh Yeah , I think that's what what what they uh mean
D :  Yeah , yep .
C :  But for two Euros and thirty cents , we uh we don't get a docking station .
D :  I think so , too .
D :  Oh , I don't know .
A :  But can we find out uh about uh this chips ? Because when we don't need a d a docking station , then probably we also have only we also need a simple chip .
B :  And then we can get a docking station .
A :  And maybe then we can do something extra . Oh , n uh oh , still oh , it's gonna get more expensive with . Two . Then we have some money left . We can put then
C :  For
C :  For two Euros .
A :  We can put a scroll-wheel on it or something .
D :  Uh why ? I mean i i if you if it would cost two Euros , that had a total a total thing , it would be nice too , I mean uh we're not gonna add uh a trip to Hawaii to it .
A :  Yeah , well who knows . Or a little bit of tin titanium .
B :  But what what can we do
A :  Yeah , or we can ki do the kinetic cells . That's also maybe an idea .
B :  But uh what can we do with the simple chip and what's difference with a regular chip and a advanced chip ?
A :  Yeah that's what then what he has to find out . Maybe you can uh find it in your email right now , then we know then we exactly know what it will cost us . Maybe is that that's nice to know .
B :  If if i
B :  Regular chip and because we don't have uh special functions to use uh in advanced chip , for example .
A :  Yeah , bu bu but when we yeah , but when we skip when we um when we don't use the do we're not gonna make the docking station , then we still yeah , we need something else maybe to make it kind of special , because that was our our special feature .
D :  I like the hand dynamo part .
D :  We can make a plain docking station for two Euros . I mean
B :  Yeah .
B :  We'll go back uh tomorrow .
A :  Yeah , okay , you can also do that , but maybe
D :  Wi wi without recharge
A :  It still is a special remote control cons uh you know , wi its form is special and material .
D :  Yeah , but but we can make a docking station for two Euros uh if you don't put the recharge function in it . I mean ,
D :  it has a shape . Of course it has a shape , but i i
A :  Yeah , but for two Euros , then we have still maybe we have to use the advanced chip , then two Euros isn't even possible .
D :  Why should that not be possible ?
A :  Yeah , then because then we'd thirty cents left .
D :  No , for for the uh for the docking station if you do if you choose the simple chip .
A :  Yeah , but yeah , I don't know , because maybe d uh yeah , we have to find out with the simple chip .
B :  That's the question . If we do i do we need an advanced chip , or is it okay f
D :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , and w and and we uh need f and what is this ? Sample sensor sample speaker .
C :  It isn't in my information , so I don't know it uh either . It isn't in my information , I uh I I've got a
C :  schematic view of the remote control , but nothing about uh advanced chips or
A : 
A :  You can look at it for s presentation .
A :  S technical functions ?
B :  No .
C :  Uh I've got here in uh I will put a I will put a page on it .
B :  No no , they were uh mine , yeah .
A :  Oh .
C :  When my mouse works again .
A :  Oh , oh oh .
A :  Hey .
A :  Oh .
C :  My mouse is uh
D :  Dead .
C :  Yes .
D :  Reanimate it .
C :  Oh .
B :  Died .
C :  Ah , I've got it . I will put uh
C :  my email on the
C :  the network .
D :  What the hell are these ?
C :  It's on it .
D :  Oh , whatever .
B :  Yeah , it's open .
A :  Mm .
A :  I don't think here it's in here already .
B :  It's circuit board .
B :  It's only just basics for for
A :  It's nothing about s yeah .
C :  Yes .
B :  At the end circuit there is an infrared LED .
D :  This isn't helpful .
A :  No .
A :  But i in the presentation of yours , there was also something about different components . Which one was it ?
B :  Components design .
A :  Functional requirements ?
C :  Um
D :  No , that was my presentation .
B :  Components design maybe .
B :  N on top .
C :  Yes , that was mine .
A :  Ah .
A :  Ah yes , it was the second one .
C :  But that was my second
D :  It's already open .
A :  Yeah , it was your second your first presentation .
D :  It's at the bottom .
B :  Working design .
A :  Sorry ?
D :  It's uh at your task bar .
B :  Yeah , but it's the the other one .
D :  Oh .
C :  Mm
B :  Was it working design or components design ?
A :  Uh , this is n this is not this n that's not the right one . I don't oh .
D :  Sorry .
D :  Okay , sorry .
A :  No , this is the other one . Or maybe something is uh maybe there's something abo in in these
B :  Chip set .
C :  But this is the same uh
C :  This is o only the possibilities .
A :  Here .
C :  Yeah .
C :  We can use a simple , a regular , or advanced chip .
D :  Yeah , nice . I it doesn't say anything .
B :  The display requires an advanced chip .
A :  You know that a push-button requires a simple chip , but a scroll-wheel , it it me requires Okay , so we only need a simple chip .
C :  Ah , okay .
B :  Requires .
C :  With the light .
B :  Little lights . Yeah , but that that's just the same as the the LED .
A :  No no , that's just a simple chip .
D :  That's not needed .
A :  A scroll-wheel it s uh only states that a scroll-wheel requires a regular chip , and that a display requires an advanced chip . So , we don't need any of them .
D :  A display uh is , of course , uh for showing letters . For showing text . I don't think that uh just a l a little light
C :  L_C_D_ .
B :  Yeah .
B :  No .
B :  I think uh the uh normal uh simple chip will be okay .
D :  Yeah , I agree .
A :  And what's the sample sensor slash sample speaker ?
C :  Maybe you can say against the remote uh page uh f uh page up , page down .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I guess so too .
B :  Yeah , true .
D :  Next channel .
B :  Well , that's not too what we want .
D :  No . Well , we might want it , but
A :  Okay .
C :  All in twelve Euros .
A :  Back to the costs .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Twelve Euros and fifty cents .
A :  So we're gonna use the simple chip .
B :  So , simple chip is okay .
D :  Great . Delete . Yeah .
C :  And the lights . Where uh are the lights ?
B :  Yeah , lights , yeah , there's no
D :  Well , there're three , I guess .
B :  category .
A :  Nah , there is some money left to be spent .
B :  Can we do it wi within two two Euro ?
D :  I think we can make a docking station . Yeah .
A :  Okay , but what we have to think about now is that is is it still a special remote control ? But I mean it isn't it hasn't got any innovative technology , we aren't gonna apply any uh innovated innovative te technology anyway , I think . I don't I don't see any possibility to do so , because it would wouldn't fit our defi design philosophy . But what w is there some extra maybe I think maybe the kinetic thing is something .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But it's original .
D :  No , that's true .
A :  Instead of the rechargeable the rechargeable thing was something to um know , so y so people wouldn't have to worry about their batteries anymore . Maybe we if we put the kinetic thing in it
D :  M bu
C :  But but sometimes you put a
A :  Yeah , you leave the p yeah , I know , but still I they will think about that . I mean if you u
C :  Kinetics aren't uh nowadays only used in watches and that's because you're always walking .
A :  The uh it's made for s people well , the they don't if it was uh uh r useless technology , they wouldn't put it uh as a possibility . And i it it th th the the target the target uh group are people who zap regularly and throw with their remote control as a matter of speaking . Because I think it when when there w was a remote control where it was useful to have a kinetic uh uh power source , then it would be this one . Because it's one it gets thrown around thrown around a lot and it gets used a lot
C :  Uh solar cells are useless .
D :  Or the hand dynamo dynamo
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hey that maybe that's cool that's a cool thing about it , you know . You don't use batteries . I've never seen it before in a remote control .
D :  Yeah , but but if we ca
D :  I don't know if
B :  But then we could make a docking station .
D :  Five minutes .
A :  No , we we we can't make a docking station anyway .
D :  That's not true .
A :  Yeah , we can als or uh also m we we can make one we can still make
D :  We can make a docking station for two thirty .
B :  Wow , w why no li Look at now , we got two
D :  Two thirty .
C :  Fo for a docking station . With a cable , with uh buttons on it , with retrieval uh device in it .
B :  two thirty left . Ca can't we make a docking station of that ?
D :  We can make a docking station . Sure .
D :  Sure .
B :  I don't know .
D :  The power device is is i i is very cheap . That's just a regular uh power cable and whatever .
A :  Yeah , but be serious , then uh the docking station will be a fifth of the price of the remote control .
C :  Wi with a button to
B :  Well , we we uh
D :  So .
C :  wi with a button to retrieve it , so it will beep . Uh , so it's uh wireless technology .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but we uh we don't inc we haven't looked at the these costs of the speaker and other stuff .
A :  I don't think it's realistic for you to do so .
D :  Well then it's a useless project .
C :  Look at the case , the case the case of of uh of uh
A :  Oh , because we
B :  Yeah , then we don't have any innovation things .
A :  We well look at all the special stuff we have . Colour a the colours are special , the form is special . It th this is whole concept . Uh maybe it with the kinetic thing , I think we could do uh do a compromise uh with the kim kinetic thing .
D :  Can't we uh
D :  Can't we say fifteen Euros ?
A :  Uh , no .
D :  No , sta yeah I mean
C :  No , then we have to sell it for thirty Euros .
D :  No .
B :  No , we only make less profit of it .
C :  It's the
D :  You can sell for twenty seven and a half .
D :  Then you make as much profit as you would with twelve and a half production costs .
B :  No .
A :  Yeah , I don my suggestion is to just forget about the whole docking station thing and make it uh like a
A :  Uh uh I I I I still fee I also feel this concept of making it kinetic ,
A :  because of the you know , it g it gives something dynamic to the remote control .
D :  I don't think
C :  Maybe we can uh can do it both . Maybe we can do it both uh in the in the in the remote . Battery and kinetic .
D :  No .
A :  No , that wouldn't n no .
D :  Thirteen twenty .
A :  Yeah , and it is also not a good it's not you have to really do it only kinetic , you don't want it to think about batteries anymore .
D :  And I think only
C :  Yes , but when it's then when it then you have to shake it uh and all when it's when it's empty .
D :  Yeah , but only kinetic , then you gotta
A :  No no .
A :  Yeah , it's great .
D :  You you gotta throw uh throw it through the room like twenty times an hour , really .
A :  No no no . No no , this is very sophisticated technology technology . When you use it your remote like once a day , or maybe even less i i it
B : 
C :  You asked for three d
C :  No , that's n that's not true . Uh , a watch is uh kinetic because you walk all the time .
D :  No .
A :  It We can make it yeah no . Becau be but a remote control gets why do they state that this technology can be used if it
C :  Yes , solar cells are also stated .
A :  Yeah , m but a w uh uh n uh a calculator also works on r on solar cells .
C :  Why don't we use solar cells then ?
A :  Because I think the d whole dynamic part , do you know , appeals to me qui uh thinking of our design philosophy , you know , with the rubber parts and uh sturdiness of the thing , and y when you move it around a lot , then people find the idea funny that when I move my remote control around and
C :  That's true .
D :  Yeah , it's funny for a week . I guess something like that , where you have to move it around very frequently , is demotivating .
A :  Yeah , but you don't have to . Trust me . The idea of this technology is that you don't think about it , it just happens .
D :  No , I I don't move my uh my remote control very much , seriously .
A :  Okay , then we d Okay , well y we don't have to do it , but what that would just have a lack of key features , you know . You m have to put something on your box . You have to make people buy it and uh
C :  Oui .
A :  We can really can do the docking thing , uh it's not yeah , uh we can do it , but it's would be a easy way out .
C :  You can do it for fifty cents .
D :  Well , we've got more than fifty Cents .
C :  The c The case the case alone is is is uh
A :  Okay , but we have to grou to agree upon something , because uh we only have a minute left or so .
C :  the case alone for uh remote control is at least one Euro .
C :  Then we have one Euro thirty for the whole docking station .
A :  No no , it's not possible .
A :  Okay , w b we can s we can leave it on be well then then th it's this is then then our concept is ready .
B :  Cheap remote control .
A :  Yeah , we make some extra profit of it .
D :  Yeah . No , we won't , but that's um something else . No , this not gonna sell . No .
C :  But now
B :  It w it won't tell , but
A :  Huh , any ideas ?
D :  Of course not .
B :  No , uh , n no
C :  Great . It's great .
B :  Yeah , we just have to go all what we did today again . You have to do it over .
C :  Our remote control .
D :  We come back tomorrow , okay ?
B :  Yeah . the
A :  No no uh there's still there's still someth concept and something special left . I mean we're gonna it's gonna excel in in on in the the range in the field of design and and uh looks and feel .
C :  Yes .
C :  Seventy Euros .
B :  No , but no .
A :  That's what it's makes it special .
A :  Yeah , and I would li I would have liked a kinetic part as well , to give it some
A :  just to give it some extra special feature , and uh I know it will work , but uh it's it's an They're they're not putting technologies on this , but if it if it was impossible to
A :  to make it happen .
C :  Why not a hand dynamo then ?
A :  Okay , well we leave it like this . Then it's c then we're yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  We can't do anything else . Warning , finish meeting now .
C :  We're done .
A :  Okay , project e uh well , we were gonna what look take a look at the last sheet .
C :  Is this it ?
D :  Yeah , sure .
C :  Okay .
D :  No , we can't .
A :  Yeah , we have to Yeah , it's
B :  No .
D :  Yes , yes . Celebration . I don't see why , but
C :  Yes .
C :  Where's the champagne ?
D :  I think we gotta fill out another questionnaire , to be honest .
B :  Yeah ?
C :  I don't uh hear a bell .
D :  No , not yet .
D :  Alright , I'll see you guys in a minute .
B :  We can do it here then .
C :  Bye .
D :  I don't think so .
B :  Can we can't we do it here ?
D :  I don't know . I don't I don't think so .
C :  Uh-huh .
C :  Just fill that one in .
B :  Yeah , we're doing now . But it's .
B :  Oh , okay .
A :  Uh , I don't know .
B :  Nice .
A :  Uh fourth meeting .
B :  We have to do what ?
C :  W what ? Alri alright . We'll see .
A :  Some extra deciding .
A :  Well
B :  Oh .
A :  I'll show you the notes again . Very interesting . Well you'll you two will uh present us your prototype .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Then um I guess that's your bit ? I I didn't s see anything about it , so I already uh thought you uh you were to do that . So the you're uh . I'll show you how we're going to do with financing this uh design .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , that's important too . Yeah .
B :  Bit late .
A :  And then we'll evaluate , after after we have redesigned it . Because uh well we'll see about the costs . Um we'll uh evaluate our p our uh production
A :  and then uh we can close .
C :  Alright .
A :  Well the finance uh we'll do later , so um firstly uh I'll show you the notes . I don't think it's very interesting .
B :  I think it is .
A :  Oh nei . Uh no .
A :  Alright .
A :  This is copy paste . So
C :  From me of course , yeah . Well from us all , yeah , from all of us . Yeah . It's a nice chorus , yeah .
A :  Of course . You had some very strange layout . Well um
A :  We ge we went through the agenda , and well we had some uh some presentations from you three . And uh I summarised what you said to us . So uh I don't think it's very interesting and go through it again . So uh
C :  Repeat it yeah . Alright .
A :  This is what we decided . It's also copy paste from what we made together . So we still know that . And then uh we can we can uh use the time better .
D :  Okay .
A :  Well uh next you two will uh present uh the pot prototype for us .
C :  Alright , we both uh will ? Or one of us will ? Uh
A :  Yeah .
B :  Alright .
B :  No you go and I'll uh
C :  Alright . If I make mistakes uh you'll uh
B :  supplement you .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Correct .
C :  Right . Uh well this is our design . Uh it's pretty uh much uh like uh Mike draw uh drew uh the in the during the last meeting . With uh the different uh perspectives of it . Uh we'll begin uh with the front .
C :  We have of course uh the the round shape uh the round uh basic shape . Um with uh the upper part being the front . Th So there's this part um which is made of hard plastic , the front .
C :  And uh we're we're using different colours . Of course for the launch we use the basic ugly colours , and later we'll put out uh more interesting covers with different patterns and pictures and everything . But basically , different colours , bright colours not black , too dark . Fancy colours . Um then we have uh the lower part
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  of the of the device . Uh which is of course um part of the back actually , because it's also titanium .
C :  You can see it also on the on the on the side view , that only this part is the front , and the rest of it , the under uh the under side uh of it , yeah , the back side and the lower part of the front is of course titanium made of titanium , and has the titanium colour of course , the look .
C :  Um then we have uh on back on the front uh the logo in the upper corner , uh which is uh made uh which is also part of the back , part of the titanium uh titanium part . Yeah ?
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , it's a double R_ , but
B :  It's a double R_ .
C :  It's a double R_ . Yeah the logo Uh uh it's difficult to draw so small , but it's our double R_ uh logo is in there . Um so that's the logo in the upper lef uh right corner .
B :  But it's very difficult to to draw that in Yeah .
A :  Yeah , alright .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Then we have the buttons . Uh it's difficult to draw again the little oval or round I think oval will be better for the for the d for the different uh channel buttons .
B :  Oval yeah .
A :  Alright .
C :  So uh oval , n those are here . And then we have the m
C :  The m
B :  Channel up and volume ?
C :  Yeah the the con the the the , yeah , the t volume and the channel controls uh in the middle here . Um um with kind of arrow shapes , which makes it also a bit more exciting than basic round or um uh
C :  uh square buttons . And also here are the two uh buttons we agreed on . We have the Okay button . Oh nei we uh the Okay button's here in the middle of the of the operators , of the channel and uh volume um changers . And then we've here the Menu button and the
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Alright .
B :  Menu for the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  And the video button . The Yeah . And of course this low part , this is the L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Mm right .
A :  So
A :  'Kay .
C :  Uh this is what we made of it . You can make uh suggestions uh if you want .
A :  Well if I look at it , the side the side view
B :  Well , at the back
C :  Maybe we maybe we should finish first uh our talk and then you can add suggestions . Maybe I I don't want to I don't want to suppress you but n I'll uh finish this uh quick . Um okay I've had everything I guess on the front ? Yeah the back . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Oh yeah alright . Yeah .
B :  No the back . With the logo and our uh l uh
C :  We thought about Yeah , uh the back is of course totally titanium . And we thought about the logo big in the middle . Just so again the double R_ . We have then the logo on front and on the back . Maybe that's too much but you have to say uh say that if you think that way .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  No I don't think
C :  And the company slogan , we thought in a kind of arc shape uh above the logo . That's basically what we were thinking about , and
B :  And the
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  And about the side view um
B :  This the front won't be as thick , but again th the the drawing technique makes it very difficult to to really uh
A :  Well I see , but
C :  Oh and uh before I forget . Yeah the the voice , of course , the voice recorder is uh at the bottom . And you can record it uh using , yeah , the the the back of the f w device .
A :  Well . Yeah I see it .
A :  Yes .
A :  When I look at uh when I look at this side view , I think w when I have that in my hand , it's terrible . If if you look if if this this is thick , and this is thin , th th then it that it lies over your hands . But
B :  Well , it won't be visible .
B :  Mm ?
C :  Why ?
C :  Well it fits uh it it it it fits the hand , mean uh the the the the
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I agree .
A :  Well what what what I what I agree is that when uh when um you have such of uh an arc in the middle , so that the the a the ends and the
A :  fronts is a bit thicker , so th then it falls over your hands .
B :  If y
B :  If you handle a remote , you you usually don't have your hand straight like this . You you have it a bit uh Yeah .
C :  In the middle in the
D :  It depends on the size . If it's kinda small , this is is great . But if it's it's larger , then you want to grab it .
A :  And how large is it ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's the question .
C :  That's the question . Uh well Yeah . H What do you suggest I mean we do ? This was Mike's prototype , and y you seemed to agreed on it . But now you have a totally different .
A :  Well uh
A :  Well the sides I haven't seen yet , uh ?
B :  Well , they lay there all the time .
C :  The size ? Yeah well the size doesn't really matter w I mean Side ? Uh oh the side ? W we we he drew the s the side , but you d you weren't paying attention as usual . Well any case , we'll discuss it now . Uh I think uh this is a pretty good uh good idea .
A :  They the the the the the side view , we didn't uh
B :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah , I agree with the L_C_D_ screen . You have it in your palm like this , and you can watch uh watch the screen . And if you have it li in the middle , your hand might be over it .
A :  Yeah .
C :  But you you hold it like this . You're not holding it like this or something .
B :  Yeah you you don't you don't grab it , you you
C :  You , yeah , y How do you call it ? Yeah . Well y y y you don't have it like this . You have it more like this . You you you're using buttons this way , or if you're right-handed , this way .
A :  No no no .
D :  Like you're holding your telephone .
A :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
C :  So you Yeah . So
D :  Because if you have a screen on it , you wanna look at your screen .
B :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah well
B :  That way , it it falls into your hand . I think .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , I agree on this .
C :  And maybe you can you can grab it a bit higher , so Well
D :  No , I don't think so . That's not uh the point
B :  No but but
C :  Well the the Well that's a reason to to to put the L_C_D_ screen uh of course on the upper side , but
B :  Well f for as far as I can see , three of us agree and only Nils
A :  Yeah well uh I think uh if you t if you three uh agree then then that's it .
B :  But you're the Project Manager , you can make the hard decisions .
A :  Yes . So uh I c I c Well , we'll we we'll do it like this . Alright , if you think that that's the way it should
C :  If necessary . But uh are d Can you live with it ? Uh
B :  Yeah ?
C :  Y Yeah , y y y y you said it was totally uh unusable . But do you
A :  No No , when I I my personal taste is that I want it to fall over my hands with a thick But
C :  But d you don't think this is completely unusable I guess . I think .
A :  In the market uh
A :  No not totally . For me , I I wouldn't buy it . Let's say it like that .
C :  Not totally , well
C :  Yeah but of course y you are also human . We have to take uh every everyone into account . So
A :  No
D :  And you might be uh You might be target customer .
C :  Yeah . Well uh who who else thinks like you ? We don't know . Maybe a thousand people , or a million people .
A :  Yes but
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , we don't know , but that's uh that's that's that's more market research . So let it be like this at uh at this moment . Okay ?
C :  Let it be . Alright . So that's that . Uh any other suggestions ?
A :  No , I think it's great .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But what about the redesigning ?
A :  Comes to that later . Um you . Uh c You can uh Walter . You can do the evaluation uh criteria on this ?
B :  Okay .
C :  You're very personal again .
D :  Alright . Great .
A :  That's more useful
A :  than just speaking .
D :  Well , this is just a short intro . I'm going to do uh the ev evaluation . That's gonna be done at the end of seven point skill criteria . So I made a I made a few questions on the hand of uh uh the impor most important requirements and trends .
A :  Yes .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And we have to look if our uh if our device uh is working correctly . Well , I put some questions in a Word file . See if I can find them .
D :  Uh uh uh uh mm .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Well
B :  Hmm .
D :  I uh think you have all seen uh this kind of evaluation , so uh I don't have to explain it . Uh the first question is , uh is the device good-looking ? Because normal p uh most people thought that um earlier devices were ugly ugly . Seventy five percent of them . So what do we think ?
C :  Well d we designed it , so of course we are very
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , we're we're not quite uh objective about this .
D :  Yeah
C :  Yeah .
D :  No , I know , but I have to uh evaluate it . So I have to take this questionnaire .
B :  Well we designed it to be good-looking .
C :  So and we ha we have answer now ? Yeah .
A :  To the customers ? To potential customers who have to take this questionnaire ?
D :  Yeah
D :  Yeah , but I can't can s
A :  Nei . Oh no . I know , I know , I know . But um Well we can go , uh because of the time , uh pretty quick through this . Uh do we find it good-looking ? Well we think so . Uh
B :  Hmm .
C :  I Yeah , I think it
B :  Yeah . We designed it to be good-looking , so
D :  Yeah , but uh , you know
A :  Yeah .
D :  We dis we di we designed it to be perfect . So But we have to be critic critical about it . And I have to uh take all these points and get a average at the end . So we we know where we stand . 'Cause th there are some things we might have uh bi might have forgotten .
A :  Well , one .
A :  Well so it's point four .
D :  Right , so
A :  Easy to find t
C :  Well l well let's start with the beginning , just one by one .
D :  Right . Uh is it good-looking ?
C :  Well , I guess uh I think uh it's uh it's it's um pointed towards the youth of course , uh if you look at the design and and the colours and everything . That was our target audience of course . But it's also not completely um
A :  Two .
C :  uh u unacceptable for older people I guess . Uh it's it's not f a device that
D :  The titanium might be uh f
C :  Yeah , that's that's uh for older people , it's it's more that classical look . So
D :  for older people .
D :  It you put uh put a black front on it or something .
B :  Hmm .
C :  Uh no . I think Yeah they like black of course , but I think they'll uh they they think uh the the titanium look of it is also Uh I think it's also good for them , so I think we both uh have uh consider considered uh the youth and also a bit older people . So I think it's very good-looking and not only for youth uh young people .
D :  Right .
B :  I think we shouldn't discuss any points points that long , because I don't know how how many points there are but uh Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  No . I totally agree . We we have to get get on , go through this .
C :  Yeah , the fourteen yeah .
D :  Right , a number please .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Is it easy to t change channels ? Yeah well I think so .
D :  So the last one is seven . Easy to change channels ?
B :  Um , no it's uh
A :  No , not false .
A :  It's one .
D :  Oh , sorry . Yeah , right .
A :  Well uh two ? Y Well we have to go through it .
D :  Change channels ?
C :  I think it's uh as easy as uh can be made . Uh
D :  Right .
C :  So I Yeah . You How can you make it any easier ?
D :  The power , channel and volume buttons are easy accessible ?
B :  With two huge buttons .
C :  Yeah , huge is a Yeah .
A :  Yep .
A :  Two .
D :  Two ?
D :  Alright . The uh device is easy to find if you lose it ?
A :  Well , no . We didn't implement anything about that .
C :  D we d we don't we don't have uh that s
B :  Well it's easier to find than a a normal black one or something , because of the colour . But
A :  Well six then .
D :  Yeah . Six ? Right .
C :  Yeah .
B : 
C :  Well we don't have the device that beeps uh when you lost it or so , but um um
A :  Are the functions easy to learn ? Well w I we do want we have a l f f less of an
B :  We have so few functions , so Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I agree .
A :  And the device R_S_I_ sensitive ?
B :  Well , I should I think two , because the voice recorder is n not self learning .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Ah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Alright . Two ?
C :  Mm ?
A :  Yeah , but just do some We we
D :  Yeah Yeah , I agree . No . Yeah .
A :  I th I th I think this is too time consuming . Uh not not towards you , but towards this all . Th this is
C :  Are we take too much time ?
D :  Right , R_ R_S_I_ sensitive ?
A :  We you have to put it to the customers .
D :  R_S_I_ sensitive ?
A :  Uh well well a bit , so four .
D :  Four . Um
A :  Yes .
C :  Yeah , very much . One .
A :  One . And features included also one .
A :  And One . Uh those uh nine uh is the fancy-looking . Uh we still think so .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Device fancy feeling . Yeah , cool man .
C :  And I think fancy-feeling too , because of the titanium back . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  Are there enough technology ? Yeah well also we have two .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's great .
A :  Is the device easy to use ? Yes we have not many buttons .
B :  The
C :  So well maybe two because of the voice recorder .
D :  Well , with the uh Three .
B :  Two two .
A :  Two , three .
A :  Are the trends about fruit and vegetables implemented ? Well in our covers , in our fronts . So yes , one . Is the material attractive ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . One or two . Yeah .
B :  One or two , another two .
D :  Nah f four I think . If you look at this
C :  Four ?
C :  Well , it doesn't really resemble any fruit , uh that's true . But but we have the the the the the sparkly fruity colours of course . And you can also have front with uh with fruit on it .
D :  No .
A :  Oh okay . Okay .
B :  Well three .
D :  Three , alright .
D :  Yeah , that's true . But
A :  Is the material attractive ? Well the titanium is strong , and uh the rest f uh the buttons feel soft . So I would say at least two .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  Okay .
B : 
A :  Well Yeah .
B :  This is the last meeting ? Yeah .
A :  Yes , but we we have to design much more , because there was some irritating account manager coming to me .
D :  The average will uh come later .
A :  Um
C :  I knew things uh were going uh too smoothly .
A :  Oh .
C :  There had to be some kind of trouble along the way .
A :  Uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yes . Well , look at the costs at this point .
C :  My god .
A :  I had to fit it in .
D :  It has to go to twelve , right ? Twelve and a half .
A :  I twelve and a half .
A :  So
A :  Well what costs a lot ? The sample spea costs four .
C :  The what ? The
A :  The sample speaker , the s sensor .
D :  Out . That's easy . Kick it out . Yeah .
A :  Kick it out . We have to go to twelve and a half . The speaker costs far , by far the most .
B :  The what ?
D :  The speaker .
B :  Oh .
C :  Yeah w tha that's uh that's a bit an optional option .
D :  That's some wrong info , man .
A :  It it isn't worth it .
C :  No . No , d th No .
D :  No .
A :  We could make two different versions , one with and one without . But for this
D :  It's uh
D :  It's just extra . Kick it out .
A :  So , zero .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Then we go to fourteen point six .
D :  What more ?
A :  Well the titanium I don't want to lose actually .
D :  Batteries are uh quite
C :  No .
A :  L_C_ three ? Yeah hand dynamo ? Y t come on , w a remote control has a battery .
D :  Uh no , no no no .
B :  Um
C :  Uh well we have a bit of a problem I think . Because uh
B :  Well well why why why should we use a advanced chip ?
A :  Well be for the L_C_D_ uh you had said .
C :  the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah .
B :  Yeah ? Can't we do that with a regular chip ?
D :  Hmm .
C :  No .
B :  Why not ?
C :  Because uh that uh y because my information says it .
A :  Well what what's the difference between simple and regular ?
C :  Huh ?
A :  What's the difference between a simple and a regular chip ?
B :  Yeah . Regular is normal .
D :  Yeah .
A :  And simple ?
C :  Uh well yeah I I read something about it , but
B :  Simple .
A :  Nothing .
B :  Elementary .
C :  Yeah , I I read something about it , but it wasn't very clear . I d I didn't in include it in my report .
A :  Well ?
A :  Your part .
A :  What happens if we do
C :  Single
C :  Well you have to use
C :  a chip . So
C :  Well you have to use the advanced chip , if you have the L_C_D_ screen .
A :  How much do we win ? One .
B :  We we we Why ? We have very little options furthermore , for the
C :  But if you have a regular chip , you can't have the L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh well we have to put that in .
D :  Yeah , we need to have the the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  That that's a fact . Uh
A :  Well , we could say , well this special colour , that isn't that that isn't there , because the the fronts they will buy it . The special colour .
D :  No
D :  Yeah , but No , that's n It's not relevant .
C :  Yeah , but it's only one half . Uh it d it doesn't
B :  Nah .
A :  Yeah , then you s then you only have one half left .
B :  Yeah , you must change the chip uh back .
B :  You must change the chip back , Nils .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh yeah .
C :  But we d Then we have to lose the L_C_D_ screen .
D :  No , Then the whole concept is uh
C :  Yeah , I know but that's what my information says . I di I didn't uh put uh the advanced chip in there for fun . You have to use it .
B :  Hmm . No we oh
D :  You
D :  You can make you can make it cheaper . But if you don't sell
B :  You you we have an advanced chip-on-print , and we have an L_C_ display . I think that's a bit double . Y we don't need both .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah ?
A :  No , the advanced chip is needed to have an L_C_D_ display .
C :  For the L_C_D_ screen . Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Says .
A :  Says , his Uh that was in the second meeting , I think .
C :  Well uh and what do they mean with curves uh again ? Because we you have uncurved
A :  Well I I did single curve to Well you said s double curved , uh he , because uh I thought it's a b a bit cheaper already . We can also make it flat .
B :  I ? ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  No no no no .
C :  Well
C :  But what what did what do n Sorry , but What do they mean with the curves ? Is th Is this a curve ? One curve ? Yeah , this is actually two curves , yeah . It's how you It's how you look at it .
A :  But
A :  Curved ? Yes , that's curved .
A :  Yes .
A :  No , it's one curve .
B :  One curve .
A :  One curve , simple .
C :  Well then we have a huge problem I think . W t we can never get uh below the twelve and a half .
A :  We have a big financial problem .
B :  Well we make it more expensive to buy .
A :  Well , then we have two dollars less profit . Come on , if we if we if we make this fifty million , they won't hesitate to uh congratulate us , so uh
D :  If if you make people brand-aware , they are willing to pay more . But
C :  But uh I
D :  Because we we use a brand at the front and uh I dun at the back . If you have uh lots of uh marketing
D :  people might buy .
B :  Yeah or we could replace it
D :  If you if you make it cool to have
A :  By the way , we also have this one .
D :  Oh , that's just great .
A :  Oh , costs nothing . That's nice . Plastic is
D :  Oh , alright .
C :  Hey but uh I think you'll agree that uh that we that now we have this uh screen , it's it's very uh not practical to ha to consider this after we have designed the entire thing .
A :  Yes , but I just got it .
C :  Well that's pretty uh l
B :  Why why don't we replace the titanium with uh
D :  That is pretty stupid .
C :  N not very practical . Well
B :  plastic coloured titanium , uh titanium-coloured plastic ?
A :  Who ?
A :  You want to dump the titanium ?
B :  Yeah well if we uh we we have to get cheaper .
A :  And make all plastic , then we ha then we're there .
C :  But I'm n I don't agree . I think
B :  But then we we've got to uh run through the eval evaluation process again .
A :  Th then you have a ugly , stupid , l ugly looking , dumb remote that that no-one would buy .
B :  Ah no no .
B :  It's not ugly looking . The looks remain the same .
A :  No , I don't think so .
B :  Well , I do think so .
C :  I think the titanium just uh provided the the tough look and the and the
A :  Yes . And the feel , and th that it is strong , and
B :  feel .
C :  And also the the older people will like it because of that . And because i Alright it's not our target audience , but it's it's useful if it's uh important for old people . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I agree .
A :  We still we had to focus to get more people from the younger group , but not lose the one
C :  I think the titanium is very important .
B :  Yeah alright but then we we won't get there .
C :  Yeah we have a problem , yeah . W But you can better , yeah , dump the L_C_D_ screen then .
B :  We can dump the special colour . We l we use plastic . And plastic is already in colour I think .
D :  I don't think you should dump the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Well what else ? W I mean uh
B :  No , nothing .
D :  Or you shou It's Or change the titanium or dump the L_C_D_ screen . But I think you could better change uh titanium to hard a hard kind of plastic looking like titanium than lose the L_C_D_ screen . Because you have lots of functions in it too .
B :  Amen .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , well yeah . Alright . I agree with that . So we u we use uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  Why can't I
B :  But
C :  Unfortunately . Um .
A :  I'll put in the report we that we think that fourteen point one is the l m lowest price you can make a remote for that's trendy d these days .
C :  Titanium-coloured plastic .
D :  Yeah , I agree .
C :  So titanium-coloured plastic for the back .
A :  I I'll talk to the managers .
B :  No no no no . W Titanium stays there .
A :  Titanium , I thi I think this this is this is e really good re remote . But
C :  Yeah this is good , but it it's not good enough .
D :  Osl
C :  So we have to use the ditch the titanium , I'm afraid .
A :  Ah those those account managers , what do th d what do they know ? Come on . Riot .
B :  Well
C :  What do we Well what do we know ? All we want is a is a fancy design but we don't really consider the costs . So
A :  Yes , yes .
B :  No because we did not know anything about it .
D :  If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So s If you don't have the money , you can't make it . So this is too expensive .
C :  Yeah al alright , yeah . But we have to deal with it now . So
A :  One and a half Euros . Hmm ?
A :  So ?
C :  So
D :  So we have to make it cheaper .
C :  Titanium gone and add plastic .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah , but then we've got money left .
C :  And on plastic times two and then we uh are there ?
A :  Well , no it's just uh all plastic . Well alright . Huh .
C :  No
C :  No yeah well Oh six . A lot of plastic , yeah . No two for the to make it clear .
A : 
D :  It's just free , man .
A :  Four . So
A :  But then we can add the special colour ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  As we have money over uh left .
B :  Yeah . W
A :  And we still have money left . What do we want , guys ?
C :  I want gold plating . No no um
D :  Yeah right . I want chrome .
B :  Well I think uh the case is double curved then .
A :  Yes .
C :  We have we have to uh fill
B :  Because you y have that curve and you have that curve .
D :  Well , th that that is the problem .
A :  Y Oh no . Alright .
C :  W we ha No no no , but th that's not f um
B :  Yeah well uh
A :  Safe .
B :  Well y we have curves in all directions .
C :  Well you can you can double curve , if you don't have titanium . And that we dropped , so it it can be done . But it's pretty funny . We we do want to reach
A :  So alright .
C :  twelve point five . But it isn't bad to to to stay at eleven .
A :  Finance ?
B :  I mean , this this ain't titanium , but it looks like it .
C :  We get more salary , if we make if cheaper than twelve uh twelve and a half .
A :  Well , guys ? Guys ? We have to dump our titanium , and we'll hate the managers for that , but now we're going to evaluate our project , of uh project , project . Well , satisfaction on for example , are we satisfactory about our creativity ?
D :  Yeah . Shoot .
C :  Objection .
B :  Pro project .
C :  Well I can't get no satisfaction , but uh I think it's uh Well in in if we consider the costs then this is the best , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think it's terrible that we got uh those costs at the last moment . That's really bad . But that that that's that , yeah that's a reason , but also for our creativity . We had um nice design , and then you get the cost , and you had to dump all your creativity .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , me too .
C :  Its it's uh ridiculous actually , but
B :  And uh unrealistic .
B :  Well we we we used our creativity , but we just had to adapt it to the costs .
D :  Right .
C :  Which isn't very practical , but that's the way . Uh-huh .
B :  Nei . Uh no .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well , alright .
A :  Uh leadership next . Uh teamwork ?
B :  Terrible .
D :  Leadership .
B :  Leadership ? Well
D :  Well it's It was very democratic .
A :  Uh yeah well I think so also . I al I I've uh filled that in in a the questionnaires uh each time , so Well the managers were terrible .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah .
A :  So , with their all their
A :  useless requirements . But o alright , the teamwork ?
C :  Well uh they they didn't think of the requirements . It's the requirements of the user , uh I guess .
A :  No they said , oh we won't d uh we won't uh use teletext , uh we won't use the D_V_D_ .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah but they base that on on the user specifications .
A :  Alright , teamwork ? Well great I think .
D :  Well
B :  Right yeah .
D :  Yeah , think so too .
A :  Uh well what do you , what did you think about the SMARTboard ?
C :  It was a complete disaster . No Uh it it it uh it is uh
D :  Yeah , I don't like it . Yeah ?
A :  Well
B :  No , that's a SMARTboard , and that's a digital pen . Or not ?
A :  It's also a It's both the SMARTboards .
C :  No it's other way around . That's the SMARTboard . That's the digital panel .
A :  I liked this SMARTboard , but I hated that one . Well it's both a SMARTboard .
D :  This this this isn't a SMARTboard , right ?
C :  That's that's the smart
D :  Yeah right . B but you This is just a large t large television . You u you use the
B :  Oh they're both SMARTboards .
A :  No .
C :  A televi Yeah .
A :  It's both a SMARTboard , but this one is used for a desktop , and that one is used to to draw .
D :  Yeah , but you ca This is just a beamer function . And here , on this one , you can uh draw the pictures and things like that . But
A :  Well , wi w which one did you like ?
C :  Yeah . Left or right ?
D :  That one .
A :  That one .
D :  That one isn't accurate . It just doesn't work . You can
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But I I think this is meant by the digital pen .
A :  Yes . Th that is so .
D :  Yeah , but I think there's a big distinction between the these th I don't need a SMARTboard .
C :  Well I didn't use uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  We're now talking about the SMARTboards .
C :  Nei It it's much m
B :  Well we we used that one , and we needed it . I think .
D :  Yeah , but give me a beamer . That's uh that's much uh much cheaper .
B :  Yeah alright , but
A :  Or install a laptop to a beamer , or have this one standing here in an I I like it .
D :  Right .
B :  Yeah I like that one , but that one is terrible .
A :  Okay , alright .
C :  But uh you can uh I I sent it about three times now . Uh a green uh board with uh chalk is much more useful than that thing .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , it is .
D :  Yeah .
C :  The simple uh sch school board .
A :  So
D :  I agree .
A :  And uh the digi the digital pen ? Did uh did you like that one ?
D :  No .
C :  I I didn't use it . I wrote things down but I didn't import it into my laptop .
A :  I used it uh just to check it out , but uh
D :  Yeah .
C :  That's the
A :  You you can't send that to anyone , because you you've scrabbled something on a page for yourself , and then you're going to send it , yeah . Well , no .
D :  Yeah . It isn't practical . Right .
C :  W But also y you write things down . And i you can also bring your your your note block . So what's the what's the th what's the point of importing it into
D :  Your notepad . Yeah .
A :  It's , no , it it's useless .
B :  Well I I drew this . Mm . And I made a mistake . But it it would have been uh useful , if I I could show this on the screen .
A :  Yes .
C :  Yeah alright . For drawings , but not for personal notes . I think that's not very
A :  For drawings , yes .
B :  Yeah for drawings .
B :  N notes mm .
C :  Uh I mean you can bring your paperwork along and p Well of course if you have a lot of paper If you've If you've
A :  But

B :  And and and this too .
B :  the sides . And the rest is hard plastic .
A :  Yes .
B :  And uh
B :  We uh we had some uh We had a new idea that that this can uh can be uh uh turned inside . And then it covers the these buttons
A :  Okay .
B :  until here or something . And then you can still use the the power button and the mute and the the joystick .
D :  Yes .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So , you can still operate uh all the things . Because you don't always use the menu .
B :  And then it can break .
A :  Okay . And the buttons ?
B :  Uh , well uh
C :  Big .
B :  Big buttons . And everything is blue , except the power button . And the mute . Of uh yeah , and the mute and the the other button . Yeah .
B :  Channel higher channel button .
C :  .
D :  Yeah .
A :  And the joystick is for the volume and the channels .
B :  Uh , yes . Yes , that's uh
C :  Yes .
B :  Very obvious .
C :  Up is channel up . Down is channel down . To the right is volume up . To the left is volume down .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so if joystick and L_C_D_ .
A :  What's the R_R_ d
C :  The R_R_ ?
B :  R_R_'s the l the the the the company uh logo .
A :  Okay . Very good .
A :  So , we have
D :  That's on the rub rubber part .
B :  Uh , yes . Yes . That's about here .
A :  So , what they say on the side is put fashion there . Yes . It's good . So , that's it . That's prototype . Now , the finance .
B :  Oh .
D :  Yeah ?
A :  We don't know if it's th it if it's okay . So , I'm gonna look . We have Sorry ?
D :  Alright .
D :  Do we Do we change the
D :  Do we change the the order ? Or are we going to uh ev evaluate it first ?
A :  Finance is um Yeah it's
A :  No , first uh
A :  Yes . We have to evaluate the product yet . Sorry .
D :  Okay . That's uh um That can be none .
D :  Um , we gonna do the evaluation now , together . But I have uh a introduction how it works . So , it will come up .
D :  Uh-oh . Okay .
D :  Um , yeah . Well , we uh uh , I have um thinked a few evaluation uh criterias , uh based on um our marketing strategy , on uh the latest trends , on user preferences .
D :  Uh , we have a seven point scale from uh true , as well . To false , seven ? And on base of each c uh criteria , we need to um give a rating . We can uh Well , it look like this . But we gonna uh do it here , they said . So , you hope found out how to do it with a Word document .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , yeah . Yeah . Um , well uh we have the Word document
A :  Criteria .
D :  You So we open up that blank here . Um
D :  Think I can Uh , what this just an example . So , this not very important . But um , if I can
D :  get a number in here .
D :  Hmm .
A :  No , it's okay .
D :  Well , uh we can't do that .
C :  I'll get it .
A :  Oh , it's okay .
D :  Um , so uh you have to think of it as uh the remote control is techno technologically innovative .
D :  Uh , and then we have to uh agree on the rating together .
D :  And in the end , we will c uh count an average
D :  of all rating . The first uh on each item .
A :  What do you think ?
D :  Yeah , I think it's uh Uh , well technologically using , it's not uh it doesn't contain many new features . Only the L_C_D_ .
D :  So , it Um , I think I will give it a yeah , yeah , yeah , a four . Hmm .
C :  I think the scroll-button is something also uh new .
C :  What uh not anoth uh , not a lot of uh a lot of uh remote controls have . I think technologically I'll give it an
C :  seven . Si six six . Sorry , six .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So now i I think you uh see it um its statement . And you true or false . And true is one .
C :  Oh , true or false . Oh , uh I'll I'll give it uh a t a two . Sorry .
D :  So , yeah . Yeah .
A :  Two .
A :  You ?
B :  Three .
A :  Me too . So it's a three .
D :  'Kay . Um , well
D :  It's a one . The first item .
D :  So , okay the second item . Um , this product is for all sorts of customers .
B :  Mm
D :  Well , it's a statement which uh I disagree with , because we uh really aim uh at at young market and I think the way it looked uh c uh totally in yellow , it's not uh really aimed for all customers . It doesn't look like that .
A :  So it's a
D :  That's uh a six .
C :  Five .
B :  Mm , four .
A :  Yes , it's for the
A :  younger g group . So it's uh half half of the people .
B :  Yeah , but it's it's
A :  So I think it's four .
B :  Yeah . I mean it still has l large buttons and not m many buttons . So I mean , the colours are for young people , but
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  No .
A :  Yes . So , I think it's four .
B :  older
B :  Yeah .
C :  Maybe version uh three point O_ uh has other colours .
B :  Yeah . Maybe .
A :  Okay . Give it a four . Yep .
C :  Four .
D :  Four . Uh , okay . Mm .
A :  We put the fashion in electronics .
D :  That's uh the motto of our company .
D :  Yeah , well do we do this with uh this product ?
D :  I um Yeah . I think if we do this , as it's uh uh c uh it's really orientates on the design . Um , so I would give it a two .
C :  Me too a two , because only the battery is not uh
C :  techin uh technologically high standard . But the rest of it is . So , I think a two .
B :  Yes . Two .
D :  Two .
A :  Uh , I say uh a five . It's not fashion , it's new .
A :  It must be a fashion .
A :  But it isn't . Yes . It w If it's not a fashion
C :  It it will be fashion .
A :  we can put it in it . So , it must be a fashion . I think it's a five .
D :  Uh Okay .
B :  Then make it th three .
D :  Okay . Yes , I'll think of that too . Yeah , agree ?
A :  No . Oh . I use my feet though .
C :  'Kay . Three is okay .
C :  Oh , we'll wait outside .
D :  A three .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah okay .
D :  The next element um is the product looks good . Well personally , I do not prefer a um remote control that's fully in yellow . So , I would give this a five .
C :  I give it a one .
B :  .
B :  Yes , a one . I like it .
A :  Well , I say three . So , counting then is two and a half .
D :  We have to do our uh Two or three ? Two . Okay .
C :  Say two . Two .
A :  Okay , two .
D :  So , well we gonna do the next part . Uh , yep .
D :  Uh uh , the next statement . It has not too much buttons . Um , yeah , I I have uh said is not because uh a low number is better . And in the end we calculate an average .
D :  So , um that's why it's a negative in it .
D :  Um , well this one of our aims not have too much buttons . So , um uh did we uh do that ? Well , uh if we go to uh this fashion , I We still have caused uh a lot of uh buttons for the numbers .
D :  But you can you can go for that . And um that way , you don't have a lot of buttons over . So , I would give this a two .
C :  One .
A :  You ?
B :  One .
A :  Me too . One .
D :  One .
D :  Um , but where where is the ?
A :  Next , six .
A :  It does not get lost easily .
D :  So
D :  Yeah , did we implement uh the sound ?
C :  Uh Just a small thing .
B :  Yes .
A :  No , we did not . So , but can it get lost if it's such a thing ? I don't think so .
B :  Yeah , but uh
B :  Yeah .
C :  Ah . Yellow . Looks like a pistol . Uh
A :  Yes . Not a not a normal shapes . So
C :  It won't get between uh the pillows uh on the couch .
A :  No .
A :  It won't get lost . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh
D :  It won't .
A :  A one ?
C :  Yeah , o one .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , a one . Next .
D :  One .
D :  Okay , um well we aimed for the younger market . Uh yeah , did we achieve that . I think with the way it looks and um it is designed , I will give it a two .
A :  Yeah me
C :  Yeah . Me too .
A :  That was our target . Two .
C :  Two . Yeah ? Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yep . Right .
A :  There's a fancy look-and-feel .
D :  Uh , yes . That that was uh , yeah , one of the most important things that uh Trendwatch said . I didn't uh say it in my presentation . But um , well does it have that ?
D :  I would say yes . So um
D :  Well , let's also give this a two . T
C :  I gave this a one because of the rubber . It feels soft . Uh , it looks like a l uh uh b uh , a bit like a joystick . It's Yeah . Yeah , f very fancy trendy .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yes , a one .
A :  I say a two .
A :  It's a a bit personal . If it's fancy . So I think s two is better .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Okay . Two . And um , then the last one I could think of , uh it goes with the latest trends .
C :  Two is okay . .
A :  No , it's new . Innovation .
D :  If we looked at the latest trends for the uh younger people , and they ate uh fruit and vegetables , well it has a um a nice colour , uh well compared to food but we didn't uh
D :  We did not paint any uh fruit and vegetable on it for something like that . So , I would did not give this uh a one or two . I We'll go for a three .
C :  Oh .
C :  I go for two because uh the the shapes are still round . Uh , the latest trends are soft things , you know , like uh I said in my presentation . Uh
A :  .
D :  Yes .
C :  But the the colours are um basic , like yellow , red , um blue . Something what also younger people want . It's also a trend , so I'll give it a two .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm , three .
A :  Me too . Three .
D :  A three .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . So um , come back to the presentation now . So , we find yourself there , and now we have to calculate an average rating . So , we will do that . Yes .
A :  Effort is three , ten and twelve . Thirty , forty , fifty , . Twenty one . So , it's uh two and three nine two and one third .
D :  By nine .
C :  Two .
D :  Yeah . Um , uh okay .
D :  Two .
A :  Yep .
D :  Come on .
A :  Uh , nah .
A :  Okay .
D :  So uh , that's a pretty low rating , I think .
B :  Yes .
A :  So , it's good .
D :  So , according to our uh own evaluation uh we did a good job .
A :  Okay . Thank you .
C :  Yeah , I think .
D :  Oh . Nah . How am I doing ? Yes .
D :  And I closed your slide-show .
A :  Okay . Back to my uh
D :  Which one was the last for you ? Uh , dreaming .
A :  Yep .
A :  Next please . So , now uh we have a product . Very happy . But uh , is it cheap enough ?
D :  Next .
D :  Finance .
A :  Um , so if uh I'll have a look . We have a battery . One battery .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Cheapest there is .
A :  Okay , one battery . Electronics . Advanced chip .
C :  Expensive .
A :  Yeah it's the most advanced . Chip-on-print .
A :  We have that one .
C :  Well , it's the most advanced .
A :  We have the simple , regular and advanced .
C :  Advanced .
A :  We have the adva advanced . 'Kay , so uncurved or flat . Nope . Single curved or double curved ? We have double curved .
A : 
A :  So
A :  Then we have plastic , wood , rubber . we have half rubber , half plastic .
B :  Mm , yes .
A :  No titanium . Special colour .
A :  Yes , yellow .
C :  Uh , yellow .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Interface , push-button .
A :  Scroll-wheel , integrated scroll-wheel push push-button , or L_C_D_ display . So , we have the L_C_D_
A :  We have two scroll-wheels ? Or one ?
C :  One .
D :  One .
A :  And it's not really a s
C :  Joystick uh thing .
D :  .
A :  Yeah , it's this one . Now , uh button supplement . Special colour . We already Uh , that's the from the for the buttons . The buttons are regular colour .
B :  Mm , yeah .
A :  So , then uh then then then then then then
A :  Then
C :  We're not gonna make it .
A :  Uh , no . It's too expensive .
C :  Yeah . Wh
A :  So , we have to change something . Fifteen Euros . Yeah , well uh when we lose one scroll-wheel , it's okay . 'Cause we can't lose the battery . We can't lose the advanced chip . We can't lose the double curve .
C :  What what are the costs ?
C :  Fifteen .
A :  We have rubber , special colour .
D :  .
D :  We would have uh n
C :  A special colour . Uh , I don't think it's a very special colour .
A :  Oh , no , we No , it's uh
A :  Sorry ?
C :  Yellow ? Uh , is it a special colour ?
D :  For a remote control . I've For a remote control , I think it is .
C :  What ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  If we would have uh uh normal buttons instead of uh the joystick .
D :  For up down left right .
A :  Um , then we uh lose
A :  two Euros . Then we have thirteen Euros . Half a Euro too much .
A :  Exactly the special colours .
C :  And what if we use only one sort of um
A :  So
C :  Um just only plastic or only rubber ?
A :  That's one Euro .
C :  One Euro discount .
A :  So , I don't think that's good .
A :  Mm
A :  I think we have to keep the L_C_D_ .
A :  If
C :  If we change the joyst uh the joystick thing into a button up , button down , button right , button left .
A :  Yes .
A :  Then it's
A :  only thirteen Euros .
C :  And then we'll lose fifty cent in what ?
A :  So uh yeah .
A :  Yeah . Then you have Or you have to cut this off .
C :  Uh uh-uh .
A :  Then it's not good anymore . So , wait . Okay . I'll have a look .
C :  No .
A :  We
C :  And if you say it's just a r uh normal colour it's a normal colour , wh No one will see it .
A :  Yellow rubber .
A :  Yeah , normal .
C :  Normal colour , and the the joystick away , and put the button up , button down , right , left .
A :  Uh
C :  And it's twelve Euros , I think .
A :  One minute , please . Uh Is it maximum . Um
A :  Yeah , it's normal colour .
A :  But if you lose the
A :  joystick , it's still uh an advanced chip ?
C :  No . Uh , no , no , no . Uh
A :  Or it's then a regular ?
C :  Oh , wait wait wait .
D :  The advanced chip was for the L_C_D_ wasn't it ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  So , the advanced is for the L_C_D_ and the regular for the joystick .
C :  Oh yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
A :  And what if we lose the L_C_D_ ?
C :  If we lose the L_C_D_ , then we have an uh regular chip and no L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah , regular chip . But
A :  Is it a good design ?
C :  Uh , yeah . Then you'll have to m uh see the menu on the television . And you don't have
C :  the L_C_D_ .
D :  If uh
C :  So , the T_V_s has to uh have to be up-to-date .
D :  If we have the n no buttons If we have we have uh not a joystick but buttons , we would have uh , we have thirteen Euros ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm , yes .
D :  And then uh we move the the colour . What will that be ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Then it's okay .
C :  Huh . No knew that .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so no joystick . Oh no , but we then we get push-buttons from half a Euro .
C :  Yeah , then it's twelve Euro fifty , then it's okay .
A :  Uh , yes , yes , yes , yes . No joystick . Push-buttons . No special colour . Twelve and a half Euros . Then it's okay . So , we have to change that a little bit .
A :  And you cannot use the red and green button . Because if you give them a s uh colour ,
B :  Okay . All the same uh
A :  you have to pay
A :  point two Euros .
C :  So , all the buttons has to have to be the same colour . But then the print on it will g um change it . Make it uh
A :  Yes .
C :  for everybody to see what button it is . Uh l How you call it ?
B :  Mm , yeah .
B :  Recognisable . Like what Yeah .
C :  Recognisable , yeah .
A :  Yes .
B :  Mm , yeah .
A :  So
C :  Yeah ?
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  So Well
A :  Now we have to change that , but that's okay . Rubber . What's the normal colour ?
C :  Oh , well that's clear .
A :  So
A :  And
A :  Where's ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  So , now it's
C :  And the joystick away .
C :  And its buttons .
A :  Yeah . It is . But then it will be
A :  just that ones .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Now it's
D :  still , he waited at the
A :  Very good . Now , uh project eva evaluation . Well
D :  No .
A :  What do you think of it ? Uh
C :  About the
A :  About the project .
D :  Project .
C :  process . Went good .
C :  Uh
C :  I think uh the creativity uh was good enough . We have a gun instead of a remote control . Um
C :  Uh leadership . Yeah , you were the project project manager , and uh had the final vote . So yeah that was clear .
C :  Team-work okay . Everybody uh has something uh to say about it .
C :  And uh no , uh o only the the drawing uh was very difficult .
C :  But , nah . New ideas found .
C :  Nope .
A :  Okay . And you .
B :  Yeah , well the same . I I espe I especially uh liked the the means , the the SMARTboard and uh
B :  Yeah , it uh
B :  It brings up new ideas when you work with uh with it .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think you have to compare it to if you would have a normal um normal project without laptops uh and without these devices . I think um
D :  Well , the laptops if you have them out front of you , you sometimes looking at that instead of the presentation . Um , well uh the draw-board , well you can draw things . But it not really going very convenient .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh , maybe it will be easier if you have a smaller monitor and uh you would also see there . And with a normal mouse .
D :  Um , and uh the project . Yeah , I agree on what was said uh mainly . Uh , yeah but you always have that some people are talking more than others .
D :  And maybe is then um the task of the the project manager to also uh ask more to the people uh less talking .
D :  To tell their opinion .
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , what do I have to say . I think it was good . Not too many discussions . So , it's good for the speed .
C :  No .
B :  No .
C :  Yep .
A :  So , I think we're ready . Good price . Evaluation ready .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Ready .
C :  Beer .
A :  That's it .
C :  Yeah ? Okay then .
D :  Okay .
B :  .
B :  That's the same as uh on the top of it uh with the the round uh button . But uh we don't uh we don't uh we do think it's um well what if with ease of use , w which prefers the which the the customer of the user prefers .
C :  Like this one .
C :  It's important .
C :  Uh I think th this is device which which has a learning curve . Um novice users u use this device as uh normal users use uh a c a remote control . And after a while they start to develop uh some skills in the the voice recognition functions , and then they will not use this dial as often . But other users who are new to this device need something like that . They n they need to understand what uh how to change channels and uh change the volume , so it's easier for them
A :  Okay .
A :  Could could I see the scroll bar as uh as as a sort of shortcut ?
C :  Yeah , maybe so . Yes , it's
A :  A a and the voice recognition as well , th maybe you could uh could uh
C :  Well , it's it's it's another approach , it's more that our um . There are there are many ways of doing uh things uh on such a device . It's it's quite easy .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Okay , good . And and the case is is rubber ?
C :  Yes , rubber ?
A :  And the buttons ?
B :  Plastic or rubber . Well , yeah .
C :  There are plastic or rubber .
A :  Okay , and uh the colouring ?
C :  Uh yellow with uh
A :  with with grey or black .
C :  grey or black or something like that . Whatever cost uh cost uh the least .
A :  Okay , we'll we'll come to that later . Um
A :  okay . Anything else to add or
C :  No . Uh maybe we should uh think about these buttons . But
A :  Yeah .
D :  Well , you could use two of them to programme the um channels on the two channel button , 'cause you have to assign two channel new channels .
C :  Yes , but it but these are tasks that are only executed once , I think . Or not ?
A :  M uh yeah . M m but maybe you do want a programme button to uh for example activate the voice recognition , or train the voice voice recognition .
D :  You
C :  Well okay . Okay , yeah , that's right . Or something li like that .
B :  And a button for disabling the voice recognition .
A :  Yeah al although by pressing the button for I n don't know two , three seconds , you could also say it you'd disable it with a little beep and and but o okay , that that's not really really important .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
B :  That's the basic idea , yeah .
A :  The basic okay .
B :  Of our prototype .
A :  Okay . Um you thought of some evaluation crit criteria ?
D :  Yes .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh my name is not name but
A :  You are nameless .
D :  Uh well , I used the the uh documents .
D :  And these uh
D :  were the most important criteria .
C :  Is it spongy ?
D :  It should be . yeah , that's uh how the fashion guys uh state it . Fancy look and feel . So
B :  So just walk through it step by step . I mean , is it fancy , everything I believe uh
D :  Uh well appar
B :  I believe it's fancy .
C :  I believe it's fancy too .
D :  Yeah , but apparently uh we shouldn't evaluate yet . So
A :  No .
B :  Oh , sorry .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , so this these are the cr uh the criteria .
D :  Yeah , I think these are the most important criteria .
A :  Okay , well
D :  So uh that's about it .
A :  the then we'll switch to my presentation . Um
A :  The production costs . The costs are not under
A :  Can I
A :  Um this is the
B :  Twenty two .
A :  Yeah , it's it's w way above um uh above the the the twelve Euro fifty . And what makes it very expensive is uh for example the solar cell . So I guess we should skip that , because it's not that important .
B :  Yikes .
C :  Well it's very expensive .
C :  Okay .
B :  Why does the price and and the s oh , one uh exa yeah .
A :  Yeah , the the price , the the number of items and the the sum . Um well , this is what I would call our luxury model . Um if you would if you look at the uh w w w what we could do to make it more um
B :  The number of uh yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  And and does it
A :  to make it just between the twelve Euro fifty , um then I
A :  did the following changes . Twelve Euro forty cents I came up with by leaving out the solar cells , um by not using the voice recognition feature , because it's uh it's a four Euro uh addition to the price . Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , I believe
A :  Uh , push-button , well
A :  It makes it the thirteen yeah .
A :  Push-buttons are buttons are are not the most expensive , but do add extra cost . So um yeah , th this design is not um
C :  Hmm .
A :  within our price model .
C :  Okay .
A :  Um
C :  But I'm afraid it's not complete . Because we use spec uh specic uh special materials , the last item . And you have not added one item there .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So it's c way too expensive .
A :  It's still too expensive , yeah . Um
B :  But that's that's only for the buttons . So the button we can use plastic .
A :  I I guess if we leave the if we leave this one out , um oh .
A :  And uh maybe not use the special form .
B :  And the pla uh
B :  And a plastic b just plastic buttons , a plas uh instead of rubber .
C :  But it
A :  It becomes a very dull remote control , I know . But it's the board decision . Um
C :  Yes .
A :  And um yeah .
C :  Well , b basically it when when this is our only option , we should even consider changing the casing , because I think there's very little added value in uh an enhanced case with these dull functions . So
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I know . Maybe we should look at an uh focus on another uh
C :  Type of m maybe another market segment .
A :  Yeah , m uh maybe not not all that fancy , but just way way more easy uh uh um basic and uh m maximise the profits and um
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
C :  That's maybe that's better . Maybe we could uh we should go for straight and simple , but that's not what uh has been asked .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I know , I know .
C :  So we should kick the board's uh Well
A :  Yeah . Although I think we yeah , but we could still make uh a remote control that ap uh um applies um more to young people uh by giving it another colour already . Um so it is possible to make uh uh a device that attracts a little bit more to young people .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yes .
A :  Um but uh I agree it's it's not a fancy high-tech uh device . Definitely not , no .
A :  It's not that innovative . Or however you s pronounce that . Um so , okay .
B :  Yeah , too bad .
A :  Um
A :  Oh , this is the wrong one .
A :  So uh that means redesign .
A :  We do not have the time o uh now to to redesign the product . Um but we can evaluate the process and um uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  uh the satisfaction on how things went . Um I'm not sure if we need to evaluate uh the device first .
A :  I guess
D :  Um well , since we're not gonna manufacture it anyway
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's true .
C :  Well , maybe it's good to do it anyway , because if we evaluate it , we we can also determine if our objectives are good . So
A :  We l we can learn .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I agree . Well
C :  Is it fancy ?
A :  I d it is it is
D :  Uh
D :  Yay .
D :  Is it ?
D :  Is it fancy ?
A :  Yeah , I think so .
B :  Um the yellow rubber , I think so .
C :  I think so .
A :  You like the rubber , uh Roo .
B :  I'm into it .
D :  So uh one ?
A :  Yeah . No , I'll I'll I'll give it a two .
C :  But it's not that fancy .
C :  I mean
C :  I think uh I think it would have been more fancy if we used the titanium housing the casing . It would be even more oh , you really like titanium . I'm I'm into it .
A :  You like tita
A :  That's a flavour as well .
C :  It has flavour . Yes , that's right . You should taste it .
A :  Right . Um
D :  Is it uh
A :  Yeah , I know , but but it but that's fancy in the way um
A :  I mean fancy has has a lot of
C :  It has to do with fashion , I guess . So do
A :  Yeah .
B :  It's trendy trendy , fun yeah .
D :  And w yeah , w what they want wanted was uh colours and soft materials . So in that way
A :  Yeah .
A :  It applies . It yeah .
D :  It it's fancy .
B :  Well , just give it a two .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yes . I think I th I think it would have been I would have think uh it could have been more fancy by using the double-curved case . It would have been even more fancy , but we decided not to , because if we use a double-curved case , we could not use solar . So
B :  It's not the ultimate uh fancy two , but
B :  Yeah , but that's sti that's uh
B :  Looking at the user uh needs , we only uh don't we don't have the double-curved case . We w we do have uh the rubber , we do have the colours . That's two out of three .
C :  Yes .
B :  So I believe uh we are close uh to two .
A :  Yeah , I I agree .
C :  Yes , I agree too . It's okay . We did yes , we did good .
D :  Okay , and uh was it
D :  innovative ?
A :  Well , with the voice recognition feature and uh
B :  But that's not in it . Ov or can we
D :  Yep .
C :  Well , let's let's this product .
A :  No , we are evaluating this this uh design now .
B :  Okay .
C :  So I I I think it is . I think it's innovative .
A :  This prototype .
A :  Yeah .
B :  And the scroll uh wheel . The solar not many remotes
B :  have the solar , I think .
C :  No . It could have been a little bit more innovative u by using the kinetic uh energy source , but it's it's way too yes , but
D :  Yeah , and uh
A :  That would have been a thrill .
D :  So uh also a uh two ?
C :  I think uh it's a two .
A :  Yep .
D :  Is it easy to use ?
A :  I'm not sure .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I'm not sure .
B :  Well yeah , the voice recognition of course is hard to learn , I think .
B :  Well , hard it's not for the for the e for the elderly .
C :  Well , but there are two parts in this remote control . What you see here is is the basic part . Everybody can use it , so that's easy to use . That's for a novice user . When you have a more advanced , elaborate user , well , such a user really would like to explore all these additional functions .
B :  They won't use it .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So in that in that way it is advanced ,
A :  Yeah .
C :  and I think it's easy to use for for both uh types of users .
B :  I think
C :  So uh
C :  It's maybe it's not very uh easy for
B :  I think a three . Wouldn't give it more .
A :  Uh I'm doubting doubting as well . Um
D :  Well the p the most important function is easy to use .
A :  Yeah .
D :  The the zapping , channel switching , volume .
D :  But the more advanced functions are probably
D :  a bit harder .
A :  Okay . Uh two or three ? Three ? Wha wh what would be your guess ? I mean ease of use um does not only apply to the most basic functions . It's the uh it's it's overall . Is the device easy to use ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , that's right . You're right in that , but I I guess uh an advanced user will will find the voice recognition function easy to use ,
A :  Yeah .
C :  because he is already he or she is already an advanced user . So
A :  Yeah .
C :  After all , I think personally I would give a two . But
A :  Um
A :  Okay . Uh Roo , a three ? Ruud ?
B :  Yep .
D :  Good question .
D :  Uh I'll go uh for the two .
A :  Okay .
C :  So , it's two , two and three . Two threes . So that's ten .
A :  So I could make it e easy ?
B :  If you make it a four it will be three in general .
C :  So that's w
C :  No , two and a half .
B :  If he makes it a four .
C :  Six and four . Six and four is ten . Divided by four is two and a half .
B :  Not a three .
C :  So
B :  Darn . Nee .
D :  Hmm ? Huh ?
C :  Yes .
A :  Roo .
B :  A seven , a three No . A four and a three together . Yeah , you have a two , he has a two . Three ? And a three ? Nee . I know .
D :  Yeah . I yeah .
C :  Four ?
D :  Yeah , two , two , three
C :  Two ?
A :  No , I haven't said anything yet .
D :  No .
A :  Okay , but if I would say a three , then it's six , and four is ten . Divided by four is two point five .
C :  Divided by four .
B :  Yes . So if you want to have the conclusion as a three three . Then you would make a four . If you fill out a four
A :  But I'm filling in a three . Does it will so it will be a two point five .
C :  That's not even
C :  But that's not possible to fill in , so we have to round it .
A :  Yes , it is . I have a veto . Exactly . It's not about the content , it's about okay , um is it easy to f
D :  Is it easy to find ?
A :  Yeah , definitely .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , we haven't re uh re uh really worked it out , but you c you can you can just say find and he repeats find .
C :  It it most definitely is it's very easy .
A :  Yeah , or beeps or yeah .
B :  Yeah , but that's the that's the the basic idea of the the speaker uh
C :  Yes .
C :  Maybe Uh I I think I think something like that . Maybe you have to uh programme it once , so to that l respond to uh a certain word or a certain sentence , something like where are you , and then it will sing I'm here . So something like that . So , I th
A :  I'm here , I'm here .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But even without it
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well , I uh we should not uh stay too long on this subject uh because of the time , but I personally give it a one . Um Sebastian ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , me too .
B :  Me too .
D :  Yeah , I agree .
A :  Right , well . The feel of the remote control is spongy . Well , uh it can't be more spongy . So
C :  Well , it can be . There are cases um in which the outside casing is um can be uh how d how do you prono is is moldable . No , it's not one of our option , but when you look in the market , when you look
B :  Was it one of our options ?
D :  No . Uh this this was a most spongy option .
A :  No okay , but but
B :  So , in the in
A :  for the options given , it's the most spongy one .
C :  Uh yes , but that's not that's not uh what they are talking about , I think . Because we compare all these uh characteristics characteristics with uh market uh with with the real market . So there are uh remote controls out there which are a lot more spongy . They're out there . Yes , but it's not good enough , so it's a two .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  They're out there . Yeah .
B :  But I think in this case in this case we've done the best we could .
A :  I'll give it a one .
B :  I wan I'll take one .
C :  You take one ? What do you give it ?
D :  Well yeah , it depends , 'cause it's the most spongy we could but yeah .
A :  Yeah , I know , but you have to name a fig uh a number .
A :  Because we need to go on in for the time .
D :  Well , if I give it a one
B :  It will be a one .
D :  there'll be one hell of a calculation . So I'll just give it a two and make this a one point five .
C :  No no no . Uh I'll I'll change it , I'll make it m my my mark will be a four .
A :  You are okay . The remote control offers enough features . Well , Ruud , what what do you think about it ?
D :  Well , the basic layout doesn't offem offer much , but the voice recognition could add a lot . So
C :  Basically it's it's completely programmable . You can add very m much functionality by uh using the voice recognition mode .
D :  Yeah , depends .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I know . What what we didn't talk about is um uh
C :  So it's quite advanced .
B :  Yeah , but it ha doesn't has the digits . I believe it's
B :  If you uh ask yourself it offers enough features , I don't I don't think
B :  it is it has all the features um a normal remote has .
A :  I think it has .
D :  Uh depends on what you uh implement in the speech feat
A :  Yeah . Bec because you can um we didn't talk about it , but you do have uh remote controls that are able to adapt another signal . So , you place a a regular uh remote control in front of the other one , hit the one or the two or the three , whatever , and it r records the uh the um the the signals . So you could uh uh uh
C :  Yes .
C :  Has uh the signals sent to it .
D :  Signal .
B :  Yeah .
A :  enter any comment you like , as long it's able to as long as our device is able to reproduce the infrared signal .
A :  So I think th this uh this is uh a a remote control with a very high level of features . Although there are i a few buttons , but the inside is is quite uh advanced .
C :  Absolutely .
C :  Yes .
C :  But that that's its power , I guess , because uh a regular programmable uh remote control contains , well , uh really a lot of buttons . At at least uh forty buttons . So it's it's quite s complicated to get uh to get used to . And this is quite s simple . You can use your voice to to programme it . It's
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
A :  Yeah . Okay , um let's give it a number . I'll give it uh a one . For for the for this t uh type of market , I think it's a one .
B :  I'll give a two .
C :  Yeah , I'll give it a one .
D :  Um I think think a one , 'cause v with a voice recognition you could add anything you want , so that's like um
C :  Yes . I I've I think we've uh succe succeed in in developing a product that's actually quite good , but not for this kind of market , and not for this kind of price . So
A :  Yeah . So high quality , low acceptance .
C :  Hmm .
A :  The product is is is uh b high qua uh has a high quality and and is uh advanced . But
C :  Yes .
A :  whether or not our clients are are um willing to pay twenty five Euros for this kind of device is doub is well , is not sure . D do you agree ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yes , I agree . I
D :  Maybe even because it doesn't look advanced .
A :  Yeah . Maybe we should have a radar uh function .
C :  Yeah , okay . But
C :  Yes .
B :  But we could couldn't uh what what's the selling price ? Fifty ? Uh twenty five .
A :  Twenty five Euros .
B :  And costs were twelve fifty . But even now , if only our production costs w uh were exceeded the double ,
A :  Yeah .
B :  Think . Production cost was were t uh was twenty two ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So uh selling price uh would be uh yeah .
C :  M about fifty Euros .
C :  That's quite ex well , it's not it's not very expensive for a remote control that that has this functionality .
B :  That's price , but w w
B :  No . An original remote control of any T_V_ kind , uh a Phillips remote control , y you pay uh
C :  Yes , it's more than fifty Euros . It's quite expensive , yes .
B :  Yeah , I kn I know uh from a few years ago , it it it costed hundred Gilders .
A :  Bu but well yeah , I know , but you're paying for th for the brand , because there are uh remote controls which control your stereo , television , D_V_D_ , C_D_ player , for under twenty five Euros .
C :  Yes . Yes , but you can you c
C :  Yes , but you can learn this thing , all these functions . And it's easier to use because those uh remote controls don't offer voice recognition and this one does . So I think it's worth its price .
A :  Yeah .
A :  .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Um you had an overall rating . Um
D :  Yeah , but uh with these ratings uh
A :  That's counting .
C :  Well , it's it's about one point five . Something like that .
D :  should be about one point s seven , yeah .
B :  Four six seven eight .
A :  Okay .
B :  Nine divided by six .
A :  Okay . Um we'll go further on with the the rest of the evaluation .
A :  About the project itself , not about the product .
A :  Um
A :  What did you think about uh
A :  the process , the project process ?
A :  Ruud ?
A :  Try to translate that .
C :  Well
B :  Hmm .
A :  Any any other Uh , Roo ?
C :  Well , I think
B :  Yeah , I think uh
A :  Roo .
B :  The process was good .
B :  But w um we weren't aware of the prices of the costs . And and that was the the big deal . I if we knew that before , we c we could have made the the choice between what yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
C :  Actually , we had
A :  Better decision .
C :  Yes . We had we had too little information actually . So And uh um the the the well , looking at room for creativity , there was
A :  Yeah .
C :  w way too the the choice of components was way too narrow . So there was not really a process of uh
A :  Less .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So we could we we could be we could've been creative . But um it was tempered by the choice of components and the the price .
C :  Well
C :  Yes .
D :  The prices .
C :  Well , in the first meeting we we already were very creative . We we thought of possibilities who are not possible uh with the the current uh offer of uh manufacturing components . So
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  We're tempered by that , yes .
A :  Okay , Roo ?
A :  Any other thoughts on that ?
B :  No , no .
A :  Ruud ?
D :  I agree .
A :  You agree , okay . Uh leadership . Okay , Roo's on for his promotion .
B :  Fantastic .
C :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  I think we're a good team .
A :  I think so too , it's it's it's uh of course a laboratory environment . I missed it um to be able to contact you in between and uh say uh , hey Roo uh . Um
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well , I tried once , but that was not allowed .
A :  Yeah . So um
A :  Yeah , but but si uh w w w when taken in account the the situation , uh I think we performed pretty well .
C :  I think so too .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Um the means , the SMARTboard , the digital pen . Did you like 'em ?
C :  Uh . The digital pen was okay , but SMARTboard was really bad . It it's
B :  Yeah .
A :  Because of the response or
C :  The response is very slow and the possibilities are very limited . It's not accurate .
B :  Response and
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh it it has yeah . Yeah , it's not accurate . The p the pointing of the pen is not um the place where it it writes its um uh where it uh
A :  Uh
D :  Draws .
B :  Yeah , where it draws . It's uh the drawing on on the b on the board is r right from the pen .
A :  Okay , so it it had to be um
B :  So uh
B :  You to take in account that your you m yeah uh
A :  better aligned , or what's the word ? Uh yeah .
C :  Maybe it's it needs to be calibrateds .
B :  It's too slow
A :  It it was calibrated just before this meeting . Uh the one before , the third meeting . So uh it's not the calibration , it's the thing itself , I think . Uh Ruud , w uh did you use the pen a lot ? Or not at all ? Not at all .
C :  It is ? Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  Hmm .
D :  No . Not really .
A :  Okay . I thought it was quite a handy uh thing , although I would like to see um O_C_R_ .
C :  I I think so too .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yep .
C :  Yes .
B :  If it has O_C_R_ , uh I think uh I would use , but uh I I just uh took notes for myself and and and that's it . It w it w yeah . It was necessary for me to uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  To digitise them .
B :  Yeah , because if I want something on the computer , I just type it . I type faster than I write . So
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  But I think it's a great solution for uh for uh a known problem , uh writing down some notes , some some inf uh information , and then um forgetting your notebook somewhere and losing all that information . Because you have everything in one place and it's quite easy quite easy it's it's possible to make this information digital and share it with others in a quite easy way . I think it's a good product . I only think it's th the the shape of the pen is too big . It's not quite uh ergonomic .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Economic .
C :  Eco ergonomic .
A :  I know .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Um
A :  What w Uh Ruud , what did you think about the SMARTboards ?
D :  Oh , I only use it to draw a rabbit , so can't say much about it .
A :  Yeah . Okay , you can't really decide . No . I missed a feature to easily select uh a slide and uh distribute it to the laptops . I think that would be very easy if you could say okay , I want to use this for my own work or my own presentation further on or
C :  Yes .
D :  No , or the other way around .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Or the other way around , that you could show but m
C :  Yes , yes .
B :  But y you can if you save this image , you can open it in your shared work folder . So it's almost yeah .
C :  That's quite what PowerPoint does .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I know .
A :  I know , but
A :  I know , but we couldn't use that feature , so I missed it .
B :  Yep .
A :  We weren't able to do that .
A :  At least the um I wasn't explained how to do such a th
B :  Mm-hmm . . A and the function of of filling an an uh an oval or an an object .
C :  An object , yes . Yes . The drawing cap capabilities are very limited .
B :  I it's not possible yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  And and uh w you were when you're using uh Windows , you're used to a certain interface and certain buttons , uh which you can use for drawing . And a lot of these buttons don't appear here . So it's
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh it looks like paint actually .
A :  Okay , so y it it's not even as advanced as paint .
C :  Not not uh n not way . It's quite uh limited .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh no . Yeah , the project is evaluated . Um but , well , we need to redesign uh the product .
C :  Okay . Oh , very good , celebration .
A :  Celebrate .
C :  Pop uh pop up the champagne .
B :  Great .
B :  It was a privilege working with you .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um you're dismissed . No , I think we are uh ready .
C :  Okay .
B :  To private rooms ?
C :  I see some action over there .
A :  Private room , Roo .
A :  That sounds quite scary .
C :  Okay .
A :  No , let's find uh the way to
A :  . .
C :  uh we're done , we're finished , I believe . So ,
C :  are there any more cycles in this process ? I think not .
A :  I don't believe so . Well , maybe we'd
A :  get an email .
A :  Thank you for your
C :  But um how much time did we get for this meeting ?
A :  Forty minutes .
C :  And how much time is left ?
A :  A minute or or ten maybe .
A :  M Yeah , ten or five .
C :  Ten minutes .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  So , we can uh
A :  redesign our uh
A :  Uh I would like to
C :  Well , I think we we we all know what the redesign should be . A simple , dull , uh one-coloured box .
D :  And no added value .
C :  No , it's it's just the same product that is already on the market .
D :  At all . So
A :  Oh . Yeah .
B :  But you see the problem , y you can't continue your uh your line .
B :  Well , it's fluffy alright . Spongy .
C :  What is that ?
B :  A giraffe ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  It's a giraffe eating a eating leaves from a tree .
A :  It's blue tongue .
D :  In interesting design .
A :  Yeah . This is a new model . But
C :  So you're actually promoting Bluetooth . Or blue tongue .
A :  Blue tongue .
D :  Oh uh it it does uh have a natural uh feeling . So
A :  It's spongy .
D :  Yeah .
A :  . That is uh it's a new feature next to Bluetooth to um disable all Bluetooth devices . Um
C :  Blue tongue .
C :  Okay .
B :  Right .
C :  Let's wrap it up .
A :  Yeah , we're done here .
A :  Gentlemen , thank you for your cooperation .
C :  Thank you Mister manager . Now , let's have uh a bottle of champagne .
B :  . Leave it here .
A :  Yes .
B :  That's alright .
C :  .
D :  .
A :  Can I close this ?
B :  Uh we don't have any changes , do we ? So no .
A :  Oh , okay .
A :  There we go .
A :  Okay , here we are again . Detailed design oh , come on .
A :  Well Ah s Forgot to insert the minutes , but it's about the same thing we discussed before . Uh
A :  Could open that anyway , think .
A :  Other design anyway , we took as we took w we took rubber as as the material last time . We also that you're just busy with it . Took the advanced chip to t uh implement the advanced features . Well , we discussed the design , no sharp corners , we rounded it off , like you see on the other screen , which is fine . Um we agreed that the colour should be b uh yellow and black . Yellow in the back because it's m trendy , more trendy than black anyway . So then we ca yeah . We agreed that we would implement both the L_C_D_ and speech recognition , but I'll get to that in a moment . 'Cause some changes in the finances have
A :  left us implications anyway . So so , like I said , we had no insight in finances , no prices , but we have 'em now ,
D :  Hmm .
A :  and it's bad . Anyway .
A :  We are
A :  Oh . Prototype presentation , well first you guys built the prototype . So you could could present that . But um let's see what be handy to do .
A :  Nee no , you just go ahead and present the w we'll scrap it later because
C :  I think it's more or less the same as we had .
A :  What ?
B :  It's basically what we agreed upon , but just a little bit more specified .
D :  Hmm ?
A :  Oh that's
C :  No much s
A :  hasn't changed that much , huh ? I didn't expect anyway . You just coloured it .
C :  No no no , not at all .
B :  Uh s
B :  Final design .
B :  Basically in what we discussed , cover and buttons will be made of rubber , yellow colour , black components , as you can see right over here . We chose a different type of colour for the menu . A bit darker yellow so that it com really shows in this keypad . If you put them all black , it's not really that good a contrast . So
A :  Mm-hmm . I like the menu .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And I suppose the the the yellow is not printed on the on the rubber . It's it's part of the rubber , I suppose . I think that's more I think that's more durable anyway than printed on to
B :  Probab Yeah . That's the be
C :  Hmm .
B :  And it I guess it's more easier to just paint it on the rubber than to uh
C :  Yeah , of course .
D :  Mm yeah .
C :  That's uh the integration story again .
D :  Okay .
B :  So we have it's a bit round shaped , that's what we had uh
A :  Oh yeah .
B :  We chose the buttons to be uh teletext , okay button , favourite channel and the mute . So that's basically what we chose there . If you have anything to add , please interrupt me .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  No , uh this is just a description of what we see there . So
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Oh .
C :  Speaks for itself .
B :  That's pretty much it .
A :  Okay . Now it's my time to ruin everything . Well , not ruin everything , but no , nah . Finances , that's what we have here , what you drew . We have battery power , we have advanced chips and the sam the sensor . The sample sensor and uh for speak recognition anyway . So which you see the which is de o one of the most expensive parts . So well , we have sin one curve , a design . Rubber design . And we had a special colour . Suppose yellow is a special colour . So just half a Euro for You have pushbuttons and an L_C_D_ display . You have the total of seventeen Euros in production cost , which is higher than the twelve and a half that we are permitted to use . So , easy . What do we scrap . Well think I had the best solution that I came up with is just to s take out the speech recognition .
B :  Oh sorry .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm .
C :  I d
C :  Yeah .
B :  I'd say that too .
A :  Because the L_C_D_ has more support on customer side . There are ninety one percent of uh the people , or something like that . But ninety percent who favour an L_C_D_ display , and only sixty percent that favour speech recognition . I think it's also harder to
C :  Hmm .
B :  Uh we don't really have a extra function with the speech sample , which you can't do with a normal remote control , which people already do . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
A :  . So I ju I took that out . So and so it's still stuck with thirteen , so I had to take out the special colour I suppose . And , yeah , I didn't see anything else I could take out .
A :  Yeah , I could take out the push-buttons , but we need those . So , generally what I came up with , in order to be cou to to have production cost of twelve and a half Euros , spe scrap speech recognition and the separate covers can account for the if people want it , we'll just then we'll do it in black . We'll just deliver it in black , have the it has all the function that it's supposed to have , and if you want it if you want the custom design , then you can buy the separate covers . You make it d orange or whatever you want .
C :  Huh .
D :  Special colour , yeah .
B :  Well , I'd I tend to disagree with you on that , because the trend issue was a big issue when we started designing this . So can't we just basically extend it to thirteen ?
A :  It was a big issue , but
A :  I'll just go back . Uh let's just let's see what okay , let's just see what we no , we we have to be under twelve and a half . It it's not uh the project is a no-go if we go over twelve and a half , so .
D :  Yeah , it
D :  The p
C :  Okay , but there's another problem .
D :  And the p
B :  Okay .
C :  But there's another problem . If we take another cover , for instance black , then we also need another button frame , 'cause black and black doesn't work obviously .
D :  What
A :  I think you that's what you were ass assigned to do really , to to see how b th both those work together . So I think yeah , it's I think it's y one of the it's a good way to um
C :  Huh .
C :  Huh . Yeah .
A :  to help people uh to make to keep the product trendy too . Just keep you just make new covers for the for it , like we agreed before . And everything that's left is is the basic function that uh that we want our product to have . Because the expensive parts are in either the advanced chip . But we need that for the L_C_D_ display . Then again , we have the L_C_D_ display , which is also expensive . B yeah , but those go together . And yeah , we could take out the curve .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Right .
C :  I agree .
B :  Yeah . We do .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Or say let's lose rubber , take plastic .
B :  We could take out a curve indeed .
A :  Could we could take out the curve . Is that an option ?
C :  Yes .
D :  .
A :  For you ?
C :  Although we are demolishing a little bit the style . But
D :  But uh the and
B :  I think the colour is more important than the really the curve , because if you just end up with an entirely black remote control
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . The people
A :  I think it's it it does ruin it , but the fact that I t took that decision or t
C :  Yeah .
A :  Took this example actually , not really decision , but the example is because we do offer the um the possibility of adding your own custom covers . So you can change any colour you want . So it's just you deliver a basic remote control with a possibility to change you into whatever you want .
C :  Can we then not also uh change the material ? We take plastic for the basic cover and
A :  You can take plastic , but I d it's something that's stuck into my mind is that something that really came forward from the marketing research is that people like the the the the squishy feeling of the spongy feeling of the and it really makes it also makes it different from the existing remote controls , because they're all plastic . So which in in turn Rubber would increase durability because it doesn't break .
D :  Spongy , yeah .
C :  We can put those to the to the other covers .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And
C :  That's true .
C :  But okay .
C :  But what do you then suggest we'd lose ? Because we have to lose two things and I guess .
A :  I al like I said , I lost the speech recognition and I lost the special colour , which would make this black a black and grey . Yeah , that's that that that's enough , because
D :  But
C :  Yes .
C :  Okay , and that's enough ?
B :  So black and grey is okay .
A :  I guess those are the basic colours . So Oh .
D :  But
C :  Hmm .
B :  Which we can fabricate , okay .
A :  I think those are basic col
D :  The people want to pay for for it , so why why uh do we have to keep us uh uh um on the twelve and a half ?
A :  They want to
A :  To ensure the profit . That that's th that's the order . We're just uh we're the project team and we got our our orders from the pro from the boss of our company which say we don't wanna spend more than twelve fifty for this . But that's not for our that's not our decision to take . We have a budget of twelve fifty per product . So
D :  Yeah .
D :  But we can take a risk .
B :  No , we basically
D :  Okay , yeah .
C :  Hmm .
B :  We need to stick to that .
A :  Stick that . I don't think it's really bad either . I mean if we we have the the backup of or the backup design thing
D :  I hope the people will like it , but
A :  to have I think they would do . Th I think they do like because yo we you we agree upon that the that the the the cover thing was a nice idea , because p you could have all sort of designs while at the same time just manufacturing one product , one basic product which you could turn into any any taste you want . So I think it's the best solution to make those cu custom covers for the design aspect and keep the functionality between of within the th the boundaries of the your f uh your budget . So
D : 
D :  Yeah .
C :  Perhaps we should make m
D :  Yeah .
C :  Huh .
D :  The first sheet .
C :  Perhaps we should make clear to our customer that we had to do this to stay under the cost . And that's uh they know that this is an option and that we had to drop the option to stay under the cost , that they know that .
A :  Well I don't think Yeah . Is it worth is it is it does it mean anything to the customer ? Like , it like , we don't care we don't care that you had to
C :  Perhaps they decide tha
B :  But they don't
C :  Of course . Perhaps they uh no , but perhaps they think uh okay , the cover is such a nice idea , uh let's that that then they uh that allow us to make some more costs .
C :  We ca we uh we can at least tell them that
A :  True , but we did we didn't get that . So I think it's it should either be a pack , maybe we sh that should be sold in in the s in stores with with a standard cover or something . But
C :  You don't know that .
B :  Well
C :  Huh .
C :  No , I'm not uh talking about that cost but the one that g has given us the order to design this . We could at least m uh make it like this , like you said , and then tell them okay , we had to drop this and that , just that you know . It is an still an option , but not for this price .
A :  They could , but uh
A :  It's an option , but yeah , it's true . So actually uh it's not that much of an increase , but yeah . We cannot contact them . It's just the order that we got . So that's what we gotta go with . So it's either one fi just just to get it f just to get it through final , it's either turned into plastic , drop the squishy feel , make it make it more breakable , um or turn it yellow . So
B :  And if we
C :  Exactly , but
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
A :  It's uh something we have to decide on .
C :  I'd say lose the curve and the colour and
A :  I say lose the curve . Oh that's true , we could lose the c yeah , I forgot that , sorry . Uh the curve . So That's just this one just d this is the banana curve .
B :  So which curve is that ba that's basically that curve .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , that's better .
A :  So this would this would be straight .
B :  So we could u still have the comfort .
A :  No , uh no , that would be a curve inside the thing , I guess . No , would ju then it would just be a straight remote . Just like like that .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Which would , yeah , turn it into something far more ordinary . we could make it yellow then , but
B :  I second that .
A :  You second that , you second that we lose the curve .
B :  No , that it would turn out to be a pretty straight-forward remote control . So that's not really that
A :  Okay , yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  So I think it would be a good idea to keep the curve to separate it from the rest of the remote control world , so to speak . So we keep the curve .
C :  Hmm .
A :  So the only only solution is either to use the l y lose the yellow or lose the rubber . And I'm in favour of keeping the rubber , because it has more more advantages than the colour yellow has .
B :  I would
C :  Oh .
C :  I agree .
B :  Yeah . I would say I would agree with you on the colour , because that's an extra option , an extra service we can deliver for a little bit of more money . So we can always do that .
C :  No .
D :  Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , um I guess people are willing to pay for that . So I think we can take that option and just with uh with the idea in the back of our head that you can customise your remote control . So I think that would still make it a nice product . Okay , we're final on that . So it's too bad we can't make the whole super thing . But anyways we're here . Um yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm ?
C :  Yes .
B :  Which is basically what we discussed .
A :  This we discussed just now .
A :  That's just now just we could just discuss how the project went . I mean , was kind of
D :  And I want to do that .
A :  I sort of expected that everything would turn out this way , but because you yeah , everything cannot be for free . We didn't I think it was too bad we didn't have the financial info the last time . Because that was I th it was really essential really to ma because we spent uh uh entire stage designing a product of which we had no idea what it would cost . So we just put something I think it's really nor not in stroke with reality actually . So
B :  Yes , we could have
C :  Huh .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Me too , I felt a bit blind throughout the project , because in the beginning I had no list of available materials , and then I d had not list of available c finances . So
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think would have been . Materials would be ok at least the last meeting I would have expected had to have that . So I suppose
D :  Yeah .
D :  But
D :  Let's um see um
A :  Yeah , let's see if it sells . I mean I suppose this sells , because it's very very extended . But
D :  Um
B :  Well I hope it sells .
D :  Let's
D :  Uh
C :  Hmm .
A :  I suppose it sells , because it's good . I mean it's got everything for the for the reasonable price , because we didn't know what it's gonna cost anyway .
D :  Oh .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Okay , let's eval evaluate uh the product of us , our design . Um I have some uh a method , a requirements and scale of . I uh will pre present uh some statements and we will decided together wha what if it's true or false and uh then we see uh if the requirements of the user are fulfilled or not .
A :  Okay .
A :  Have been met , okay .
D :  And I will
D :  uh make a new blank sheet .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So so the buttons , the look and feel . I thought it was okay , but the advanced uh settings , um screen , audio and channel
B :  Which are basically accessible through the menu button .
A :  They're stuck under menu .
D :  We are not
A :  For the menu . I think those are totally met , because we we really took them for the they have the feel they want , they have the simplicity they want . I think it's very uh very well met . Either two or one maybe .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Oh the menu button is it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Hi Oh , okay .
D :  Then it's all uh
D :  S it's true .
C :  One .
A :  I think we took that everything they wanted into consideration . So it could either be a two or a one .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So d
D :  Oh wait . Uh pen . The p
A :  One and a half .
B :  Which is not an option .
D :  Oh yeah , it's red , okay , but
A :  Just create our own option .
D :  Look and feel is everybo it's true .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So
D :  Anyone ? And the next one uh yeah , when it's lost uh you can find it . It's
A :  It's perfect . Even for deaf people , yeah . It's I don't think it's perfect , but we did everything possible to to get it back . Because if it's stuck in you couch , you can see the light . Maybe you can hear it . But I mean we tried , so I think it that's that deserves a one .
C :  Hmm .
B :  To make it that way , yeah .
D :  Yeah . And it's
D :  and it's yeah .
A :  Definitely .
D :  To . That's okay then . And the next one .
D :  How is that ? Uh w we had we don't have an uh
C :  Manual .
D :  manual , yeah .
C :  I think the L_C_D_ display could be a little bit more difficult then a normal remote control , but then again , it's for young people . So
D :  But I think that's a part of it . But
A :  I'd use an remote control .
B :  Mm yeah .
D :  Yeah , an L_C_D_ , it tells a lot about uh
C :  Yeah , I th
B :  And it's pretty straight-forward , you have a navigation no keys to navigate through the L_C_D_ menus . So
A :  It's pretty straight-forward , uh-huh .
C :  Exactly .
C :  No , that's true .
C :  I think it won't be a big problem .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So it's a one or a I don't know .
B :  One I d no , actu
A :  I think but we didn't even there was no issue on making a manual actually . We didn't really discuss it , but
D :  For the advanced uh settings .
D :  No okay , that uh that's true .
A :  I don't think it takes no , it really does doesn't take time to learn , I think . We took it s it's so easy , we have so little button , everything speaks for itself really . So I think that's yeah , we didn't it's either two or one , I guess . Maybe it's a two , because d uh the L_C_D_ is a little is a little new and there is there are some option hidden under the menu button . So I might make this a two instead of a one , I guess .
D :  Oh , so it
B :  No , it it is pretty straight-forward .
C :  Ah . Um
D :  Takes no ti
C :  With the more important functions on .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  And the L_C_D_ , you have to see it .
A :  So just make that a two .
D :  Um mm
D :  Oh , it's a little bit
D :  learning .
D :  Okay . Uh yeah it's uh a little bit same . But it tells you or not ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  You can use the L_C_D_ in a good way . I think so . I think it's perfect , the w where it is , what it can do , if it useful . I think so .
D :  But wha w oh , yeah . What are we uh
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  displaying on the L_C_D_ screen ? Just uh only the channels and or
C :  the menus uh
D :  What uh ?
C :  Things like brightness and uh those kind of things we've put in the menu , because we have no buttons for those .
B :  Well , basically the menu options indeed . But
D :  Oh , in the L_C_D_ screen .
A :  No , y I mean in the L_C_D_ screen , the small screen . What does it display ?
C :  Yes .
D :  And for a channel selection , uh or that's not
A :  Well I thought it was I thought it was I thought that people wanted previews on their I'm not sure if that even possible , but 'cause it's this requires a quite quite a bit of band-width . I don't think it's possible really . But
D :  Yeah , I thought I thought too but yeah .
A :  the they didn't really define in what should be used for .
D :  But
D :  Maybe a T_V_ guide or something in your L_C_D_ uh
B :  No .
A :  But I think in for example like T_V_ guides , I think that's that th that you can transmit through it and everything . Just for extra information on your programmes .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , it must be clear then what what what for we use it .
A :  But also things like like like menus or p how about preferences of your uh with configuring your remote control for favourite your favourite channel for example , how do you configure that . So that could be done by L_C_D_ display . I think it's good . No , maybe it's not a one because it's we're not using it perfectly . We didn't give it I don't thing over-discussing . Now we gave it enough thought though . I think we d should just lower this . Maybe maybe it's a three though . We could've used it more effectively probably .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , indeed .
D :  So everybody's agree with an uh three on it , it's
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah . Two or three . So
A :  Yeah , we are using it , but it's not it's not poorly used , but it's not efficiently used , I think . We could have ev even lost the selection button and uh done everything via L_C_D_ selection . It's now it's just extra to illustrate im uh extra features , but okay .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I
D :  A three .
C :  Nah , it's not really only an extra . No menus . Think about
B :  You can seven .
D :  Ah , nothing , that's
D :  A seven . Uh that's uh
A :  Can you talk to remote control ? Well , it can't talk anymore . So we scrap that .
B :  Or we could say it
D :  Yeah .
B :  Or we could say neutral , we 'cause we scratched the
A :  Oh yeah Just to be a prick , but of course you can talk to your remote control , it doesn't do anything . But you c you can talk to it .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Not with the speech recognition . Uh yeah , all the trends and no colours uh anymore . So
A :  Well , we did take everything into consideration of course . Uh the shape i shape is i
D :  Yeah , uh um only in the curves .
A :  I think we yeah , I think that's okay .
D :  But the colours , we don't have special colours on it .
B :  No , we don't have the colour . So I
A :  Yeah , special co but we took into consideration the fact that it's customisable to the fashi
D :  Yeah , but we yeah , we don't have it , so d
B :  Yes , but the end product So
C :  Hmm .
A :  We don't have it we do have it , it's just sold as a package . It does it's not part of the basic product .
D :  In the end product .
C :  But
C :  Changing covers is also trend that we followed .
A :  It that that's what I call trendy . I mean the shape is trendy . The the sh the the functions are trendy . It's just the colours that are not supporting the basic model . Because you ha it's just not affordable at the moment .
D :  Now
D :  But it's not a one .
B :  Maybe we should go with a two then , because it's not perfect , because we can't do it initially , but we
D :  Yeah .
D :  Oh .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It's possible , but you have to pay extra for the for the possibility of having it in a f a different colour .
D :  Oh well
D :  Oops .
D :  Oh it's a two , right ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  On the last one . Uh that n that's all .
A :  Overall score .
B :  Overall score .
D :  Overall . It's um
A :  One two three . sixteen .
D :  ten , sixteen
D :  three uh two two point seven or something like that .
A :  Two two point some two point something .
C :  Hmm .
D :  I don't know why .
B :  Ten , sixteen ,
A :  .
B :  divided by
C :  Six .
D :  Six .
B :  Is two two third .
A :  Two and two thirds .
D :  Um
D :  So we can say it's it's the product is it's okay .
A :  It's okay , but that's yo m mostly it's it's influenced by the fact that we didn't have enough resources to implement speech recognition . 'Cause yeah , that gives you a seven , which ruins your your average .
D :  Y not
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  There's
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Without that it would be like under it wouldn't yeah , it would be under two . So I think we have even with this it's reasonable .
D :  Woah .
B :  Yeah , if we make it into a four , as in neutral , because we didn't implement it , so we can't say that we that it's really not well implemented . We come out on a average of two one eighth .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well I think it's two is okay .
B :  So which is pretty w good . It's at least on the positive side . So We could definitely have done better if we've had more resources , but
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , two is pretty good .
C :  Hmm , of course .
A :  Definitely .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , I think it's probably I I do admit that we d did miss a little or didn't sp didn't talk talk enough about the possibility of the L_C_D_ display . We could have used it more efficiently , we just didn't think of it that way .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . True .
D :  Yeah , with .
A :  So like I said , changing channels , everything hidden in your L_C_D_ display , so you just need the navigation buttons to do everything .
D :  The scale .
C :  But I think for this price , this is it's really a reasonable product . It's a good product .
A :  I think we div I think we did very well , uh ev even if you look at this score , we did quite well . It just looking for improvements what what you could have improved . So .
D :  Yeah .
D :  With an L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Oh .
C :  Oh . Yeah . But if pep people really want speech recognition , then they must be prepared to pu to pay more , because it's cannot be done for this .
D :  Yeah , you can make 'em another one .
A :  They sh they should get kids , and just stick 'em in T_V_ and say change the channel .
C :  Hmm yeah .
C :  Ah but for this price uh you cannot ask that . You cannot th think of that
A :  I don' think so . Uh it's just not it it's not affordable . Or your sh you should lose the L_C_D_ screen probably , but I think that's I think the L_C_D_ screen is more worth than speech recognition .
C :  No , it's not .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Oh It's also more attractive .
A :  Definitely . Okay , that was that .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So that's the final product without the speakers , I guess . Let's see , what was left in the the Another one .
B :  So did you
A :  Hmm . Yeah , we evaluate the product . General project , what's i in For example , I thou I thought we were pretty creative in what we created . We took the whole new approach of making exchangeable cover for example , which I thought was pretty creative , because it was never never ever listed somewhere .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Favourite channel .
A :  Well
A :  Anyways . Yeah , leadership is up to you . I mean perhaps I screwed up because I d put a put a speech recognition into it . But that's not for me to decide . I think we did pretty well as team-work though . Because , yeah was very hard to work with one another if you cannot communicate in the meantime , because when I got the when I got the input for the financial results , initially of course I wanted to contact you . Say , look , this is you're doing the wrong thing , you're s you're wasting your time now , because we're implementing stuff that we cannot afford . So it would be better if y if there was more communication between uh because that's that's what would w you what you would normally do , either call or email someone . So that was too bad con was impossible here anyways . .
D :  Yeah , I know . Yeah .
C :  Yes .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , you're working separate .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Huh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah yeah .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah . Direct uh communication with yeah .
B :  And we could share information which we received .
C :  Hmm .
C :  That's the same thing that I had in the beginning . Everybody was using materials that s I didn't have . So
A :  It didn't have or didn't knew what they costs or whatever . There was just too little information about what things actually cost and if you could use them . So that was a little unclear I suppose . I think a SMARTboard SMARTboard is pretty cool . I think uh s especially for design issues , it's very easy just to give your give your thoughts a little it's easier to share them .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Oh .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
D :  My handwriting is little bit yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Although for actual design I'd say the response time should be a little bit higher , because
A :  It's a little less it the response time is le it's very bad . It's good to visualise everything , but I think the response time should could be a lot better .
C :  Hmm .
B :  The digital pen was definitely better to draw my ideas and to
D :  But th that's
A :  Definitely .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , it's true .
D :  Yeah , okay .
B :  further elaborate on that . So
C :  But there's uh also one problem with this I noticed . Uh you have to finish a page before going to a n
A :  No , you don't have to . No , you don't . I jin I didn't check the finish button . I just you just ditch it and you can copy it or whatever . Uh only if you uh check the notes or press done . Then it um then you can then it exports to Word automatically . But it's not necessary to check either one of those two . You can just preview your p you can just preview your page in the in the programme .
D :  No . You can
C :  Oh .
D :  Done and then it's okay .
C :  Okay , I saw that uh
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah , but I made
D :  Oh , okay .
C :  Okay , but I made three pages and they were not finished . And when the third one was finished , I wanted to download it and then it was not possible anymore , because you have to close all the pinnits uh the pages before going further .
D :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Okay , before starting a ne a new page . Okay , that could be b .
D :  Okay .
C :  Exactly . So we cannot work on more than one page at same time . That's not possible . You have to finish it completely , then download it , it's then start a new one . That's not very uh handy , but if you know that , then it's not a problem .
D :  Oh .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  Oh can you ? Okay .
A :  Yeah , okay .
A :  That's
A :  Yeah , it's understandable , okay . Any new ideas ? Yeah , more communication between between uh that's the thing I noticed , that communication is very um very important , because if you get new information , it's essential f for the other team-mates to know that as soon as possible , because you would avoid making doing extra work , because you were doing extra work now uh m working on the on the speech recognition , you have limitation both on the technical on the d on the design side . So I think that could have been better . But that's I think it's more of a a setting here that you cannot communicate than uh than somewhere else . So
D :  Important to mm
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah , well it could also possibly be well , is it a more real-time information base , so we can all see which information is available to one another .
A :  Yeah , I think so . And l less p less spam probably . I'm not sure i I'm not sure you got spammed as well , but I get spammed like every t every two minutes there was a there was another email about master classes or something . So which were totally useless actually . I thought I should probably look into them , but they were all useless . So I just
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Ah .
C :  Well
C :  Hmm .
B :  Well , I personally did not have that , but
D :  Mm
A :  Oh okay .
B :  That's probably your l description . But I also didn't not really . But still , you had that as well . Is that we finished up the design and then we checked the website , and then there was just extra information .
C :  Huh .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , after
C :  .
D :  After five minutes , uh
C :  Yeah ,
B :  There was a little delay in the bit of a c
D :  Yeah .
A :  I didn't have any uh more information , it's just always the same here . So that's that's kind of a
B :  crucial delay .
C :  Mm .
D :  Email uh
A :  It would change , but not for me . So I'd I had no extra information to go on that one than what you give me actually . I couldn't do any research myself or I see , that's yeah , w I could have done a little extra work probably , then
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  it's
A :  But I was busy enough anyway . So
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Any new ideas found ? Or is that a 'cause uh yeah , it's well , probably is .
C :  No .
B :  How much time do we have for this anyway ?
A :  I have no clue . That's like oh,but it
C :  .
A :  Should i if the project is evaluated and it was it was in b within budget , we should celebrate . So
C :  Okay , bring out the beer .
B :  Yeah . Champagne .
A :  Uh okay , think that's about it . Uh
D :  I want one for my own .
A :  I'm not sure what we should still do though uh t let's see what all your tasks were finished , right ? What you ha from your assistant . So let's
D :  Yeah .
C :  I have no more email . My coach is uh being very silent now .
D :  Yeah , my personal coach i
A :  Okay , I should I think I sh I still have the the total report to finish up . I think we took very little time now , because
A :  Yeah , we're in agreement , everything the design is okay . The one thing we missed though ,
A :  we don't have a product name .
D :  What
C :  No , we haven't think above about that . Huh . It's better than thi I think than a serial number . Sony uh T_R_ something uh f means nothing to me . Uh
A :  How about you cook a how about you cook up a product name ?
B :  Product name .
D :  Yeah , name .
D :  Or fruit name .
A :  Just oh , think of a catchy name . I'll be working on this until the beep until it beeps . So
C :  Like fruit names .
D :  Fruit name or something like that . The banana remote or something . I don't know . Yeah , it's the form of it .
A :  What ? Fruit ?
A :  You don't want it to resemble a banana . It's not yellow anyway . It's not yellow anymore . It is curved , but
B :  The bana 'cause it's not yellow anymore .
D :  Yeah oh , yeah .
D :  Uh yeah .
B :  Well , uh I was going for the R_C_ deluxe , but it's not really a catchy name or anything , it's more
D :  Uh
A :  No , it's
C :  Uh at least it's not something with numbers . Numbers are so meaningless to the people . I mean
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Something with our company name , can we do anything with that ?
D :  That's true .
C :  .
D :  Reaction , Real Reaction .
B :  Maybe there's something on the website which will help us out .
C :  Real Reaction .
B :  The reaction deluxe .
A :  Real Reaction future R_C_ .
A :  Step into the future of of remote controlling your T_V_ .
B :  Is that a name or a c campaign ? Yeah .
A :  No that's a that's a catchy slogan .
B :  Or the
A :  Control your remote control .
B :  The real reactor .
C :  Real react .
A :  I go for future R_C_ probably .
A :  Something like
C :  The Real Reactor , I don't find that uh that bad at all .
A :  It's short f
D :  .
A :  Real reactor ?
C :  Yeah . Because our name is Real Reaction .
B :  You should write it down as a an option .
A :  Uh that that's
D :  .
A :  That makes me think of different products than a remote control really .
A :  I'm not sure . Real reaction in a real
D :  Zapping .
D :  The
B :  So that's one option .
A :  Real reactor .
A :  Didn't notice .
C :  I'm looking for things in the name . So that the first three letters are s the same . R_E_A_ R_E_A_ .
A :  Mm .
B :  Should I write the banana down or
D :  Yeah , sure .
A :  I take f yeah , take a banana .
B :  Sure ?
D :  The banana .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Remote .
D :  Banana recei R_C_ .
C :  The triple R_ . Real Reaction remotes control . Triple R_ .
D :  Remote .
B :  Well I
D :  R_ three C_ .
B :  Uh do you mean it like
C :  ?
D :  R_ three C_ .
C :  yeah .
B :  You mean it like this ?
C :  Yeah , that
D :  Real Reaction Remote Control . R_ three C_ . Oh yeah .
C :  .
A :  No , not like that . It should be it should be longer , because it's not a product name that you f print on a box .
C :  .
C :  I think
C :  triple R_ . Doesn't sound ?
A :  Just write out triple , like a word triple R_C_ , triple stripe Oh . Triple dash R_ dash s s C_ .
D :  Yeah , triple R_ .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Triple R_C_ .
C :  Ah .
D :  The triple R_C_ , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  R_ s R_ three C_ .
D :  .
A :  R_ dash C_ .
B :  Dash C_ ?
C :  I think I like it like this more .
A :  Dash . Triple R_ or triple R_C_ ?
B :  Like a C_ right now or a dash in a C_ ?
D :  Triple R_ dash .
A :  How about do both ?
A :  Sure if it looks stupid .
A :  Uh I think that the the R_C_ together takes away the the the image of it's a triple
C :  Hmm .
A :  Uh the first the first one looks like it's a triple remote control , but it's only a single remote control . And it's especially on the triple R_ that's important . The Real Reaction Remote .
C :  Mm .
D :  That
D :  Yeah , this yeah .
C :  I would huh . I would lose the C_ and just name it triple R_ .
B :  Is it triple R_C_s ? No .
C :  It sounds like uh thinking about two different things and combining it . I would just say triple R_s triple R_
A : 
D :  Triple remote .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , triple R_ yeah , you can
B :  Well , that's another option .
C :  That's also short , catchy .
D :  It's okay .
A :  Yeah , triple R_ .
B :  Okay , so which ones are we going to scratch
D :  The banana . Banana .
B :  definitely ?
C :  Banana .
A :  Banana remote .
B :  I say this one as well .
D :  Yeah , the deluxe .
A :  I think we're all in agreement about the triple R_ . I think triple R_ is cool .
C :  .
C :  Yes .
D :  The r triple R_ .
B :  Triple R_ ?
B :  Triple R_ it is .
A :  And it looks cool when you print it in font , looks pretty cool .
D :  Yeah .
C :  did you do now ?
A :  Just like this just and you just print triple R_ , it looks doesn't look bad , it's short , it's okay . So have to write my report now , I guess . Um
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um
A :  Yeah , so we have everything . We have the product , we have the costs , we have the possibility of everything . Okay . I think it's adjourned . Retire to my lair and finish the report .
C :  Yep .
D :  It can't work . That will not
A :  That was a short meeting .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But efficient though .
C :  The boss is always the last one to go home . So
A :  Probably . See . Okay , goodbye .
D :  Okay .
C :  See you in a minute .
D :  Damn .
D :  I will write that one
D :  in a Word uh document .
C :  Okay .
A :  Could you guys draw me a picture of the final design to put on the cover of the report ?
B :  Yeah , sure .
C :  Can't we take this one ?
D :  Oh sh
C :  Otherwise we have to do it all over again .
D :  Um
B :  I don't really know whether we can save it as a picture or no .
C :  Is it okay if I try ? Is that okay with you ?
B :  Sure .
D :  Yeah , okay , I will ask you when uh I need the information . So it's oh .
C :  I'll put it back in a minute .
C :  Okay , it has been saving something , but where to I don't know .
D :  Uh
D :  Oh .
D :  Merge .
C :  Oh , can I say exp yes , I can . Export as J_ PEG .
D :  Sucks .
C :  .
C :  Okay , can I not put this
C :  wherever I wants .
C :  My document is the wrong one , huh .
D : 
D :  Yeah , but
C :  I cannot
B :  Network places .
D :  I don't know . Smart no .
C :  .
D :  Ma it's maybe it's not on the network of uh the rest . That one is . .
C :  I don't think so .
C :  Document and settings .
B :  I wouldn't pick that one , no .
C :  That's a pity . That means that we have to gonna draw it again .
C :  Are you gonna do that ? Okay .
B :  Sure . Oh .
C :  That
C :  Yes .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
