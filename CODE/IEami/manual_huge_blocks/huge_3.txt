A :  Right first time this time .
A :  There we go .
A :  It's not that complicated , but I get it wrong every time .
D :  Okay so we are just waiting for Matthew .
A :  For Matthew , yep .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh
B :  So I suggest we start the meeting uh without Matthew uh he's uh obviously late for some reason .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm 'kay .
B :  Good .
B :  Um .
B :  Today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design .
B :  I hope uh you both did some uh some work uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  concerning a uh conceptual design . Um this will be the uh agenda for
B :  the meeting uh . Uh I will
B :  take some minutes uh again . Um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members , and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
D :  Yep .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So and that uh will uh we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So um who has the fir do you ha Anna do you have your presentation ready ?
A :  I have a presentation , I'm just making this
D :  Yeah I think yeah the Matthew it is it's important that Matthew yeah is here because
B :  Okay .
B :  Ah there is Matthew .
D :  it's really a a team uh project with a team and if someone is not here then we cannot but it's okay it's good .
C :  Sorry .
A :  Okay I'll just email you this file , my presentation .
B :  So .
B :  Good .
B :  Do presentation ready ?
A :  Mm-hmm I'm just emailing it to you .
B :  Oh okay .
C :  So
B :  So did you manage uh
C :  Yeah I sent you the slides , you didn't see them ?
B :  Oh yes I see him , good yes .
C :  Okay .
C :  .
B :  No .
C :  So
C :  'Kay .
A :  Okay it should've gone through to you .
B :  Okay mm yes I have it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . Um can I just put this on ?
A :  So we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it .
A :  Um .
A :  This is to do this I will not remove my microphone .
A :  We basically used um some focus group surveys which I went through with you last time , the main results of that , and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um , and as part of this
A :  The important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . The most important by far was the look and feel of it . It needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . It needs to stand out . It needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . Most people find remote controls boring at the moment , we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . People will wanna buy it . Um
A :  That was twice as i important as the next item on here which is that it has to be technologically innovative has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . People have to then think about it and say got something there that I want . That's a really cool feature , and it has to make them wanna buy it again .
A :  Third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , it has to be easy to use . So they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um .
A :  Drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . This is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . Um I had a talk to the design people about this , but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . That would make it stand out . Um .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  So can you repeat and be more precise about what you just said ?
B :  Spongy feel ?
D :  Uh about the feeling yeah uh yo
C :  You can
A :  Well ma make it not necessar sp spongy is the current thing . Spongy is the current texture , but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart , rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  So as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . So going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um .
A :  Going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , they've all got those a lot of them have the changeable covers , so they can choose what colour the outside is . That's one way of looking at it um .
A :  Textured feel we just talked about . Maybe it's another way of doing that . So if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . So they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever . Um and yeah , still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah that's a very good idea , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . Also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . They're big selling items . People put a lot of thought into that so we can leverage off that , and we can start using some of their ideas .
A :  Um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , but still a big issue . Um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , uh that's one thing we could look at . There are other aspects like L_C_D_ screens and speech recognition which weren't
A :  I don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . I think we're better doing something basic like this which is very important and very will be a really cool feature to put in .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And
A :  use . I had no real specific ideas for this , maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves , and then yeah and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yes well maybe Matthew can can give some more information on the
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Voila .
A :  Yep and that's the presentation .
B :  Okay good , that's very clear .
D :  Yeah very clear .
C :  Yeah .
B :  'Kay .
B :  Um .
A :  So does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? I think you
B :  Uh
B :  Maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel of uh I've it was a good idea maybe to to
D :  To let the people choose , you mean ? Yeah .
B :  Yes the the the there are changeable covers , but on the other hand I I don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational
A :  Hmm .
A :  Well we're selling so many units of this . This is gonna be a mass marketed product , we can afford to have two or three different designs at least .
B :  Hmm . Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah a range of uh yeah , a set of three , four different aspects .
B :  Yes .
A :  Mm mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Sure that fits the
B :  Yes and of course it will be a we we get a if it works we can get uh after-sales I mean that would would be very good I mean those covers could go for for three , five Euro .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  That's a very good idea um
B :  And then uh
B :  maybe uh we can go a th Matthew's presentation because
C :  Yeah s then we could discuss later like we can put all ideas together .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  the
B :  Together indeed uh , because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use , what you were already mentioning .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah yeah I agree .
C :  It should be easier with that .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So
D :  And your part is very related to mine because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah so I'll I'll go with that actually so um
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay so m so then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , and uh they could be like buttons or like and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , and uh maybe like you can have different colours for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button .
C :  So this this is the general trend to ha the method they do . So what I have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the T_V_ , V_C_R_ , music system operated ones actually , and they are very specific to each other , but there are some common keys for example if you want to follow the V_C_R_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have and uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  There is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , like You can basically if you have a multiple functionality , say T_V_ , V_C_R_ or something I say it to the T_V_ and the T_V_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm . I like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like B_B_C_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . That's a good idea .
C :  Yeah yeah so you you you can just uh because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly , even if you arrange it by however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to
D :  .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm . Yeah I really like that idea .
D :  So what functionalities do you suggest for that ?
C :  So it it it's like it limited one . In the present market I saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . Basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , you want to st store your favourite channel . Yeah some ten twelve channel information . You know you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that .
D :  For facing this problem ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Maybe ten channels , yeah at the most .
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  And uh basically uh it depends like the remote with L_C_D_ display for browsing because you have multiple functionalities for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is now , so I am using the T_V_ so
C :  every time I use it , it could be like , for example I can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , so I press it so the display says , okay , I'm in T_V_ or D_V_D_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , to model the functionalities will increase actually , and for you and you might want you don't want separate keys for all of them . You can't .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh yeah yeah yeah mm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
C :  And uh well there can be children friendly where you can programme your remote so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . So these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I personally would look at things like having a u universal remote , is uh um is a good idea , like instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . I got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi Joe , or something like that , you know , and uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm b
A :  But a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary .
C :  Yeah you you won't be using it , so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word and it's uh it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing which is again and maybe having something like a blinking thing , like uh it could indicate you're uh it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote , the blinking . At the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also or
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And you want okay for coming back to one point y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? Some of them ?
A :  Two thirty five supposed to finish .
C :  Yeah you can let them to do that .
D :  And uh isn't that too difficult for the we want w I don't know if we still want the um R_C_ to be easy to use , that's the compromise .
A :  Hmm .
C :  N no but the if you give it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . Like for example uh I would like to store in certain way , so if you want to give the full freedom to the user or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint . So it de
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think you can do it both ways . You can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features .
D :  A standard .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um yes but but I do maybe you can give a hand to us because I I'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve Euro and fifty cents . I'm sorry to have
C :  So
D :  Yeah .
C :  So
A :  Hmm .
B :  Every time I have to come down on this price again to so this might be a little limiting for your creativity , but it's it's it's the real
A :  Hmm .
A :  Hmm .
B :  We have to consider it . S so do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition , I mean maybe it's possible for for twelve Euro but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm yeah like I would say that for programming uh keys , you said , uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve Euros , but for the A_S_R_ system , uh I'm not sure if it's feasible to have this or
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  We well we can still look at we can talk with the coffee unit and you can uh check how much how much they yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Exactly yeah i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented , and w how much it's cost , maybe with a f cheap chip .
A :  Mm .
C :  Maybe we can come we we can talk to them , and we can come with that , you know . And also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something maybe if you added little bit of display , you might need the to che keep checking the battery , so you really need a some kind of indicator , so it could be a blinking option of L_E_D_ it could actually be used to detect also . If it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also .
B :  Mm mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
C :  So
B :  Mm .
A :  I like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them or if they if they light up or something .
C :  No actually i if i it is like you know it tells you um , it can be for two purposes , like if you have an L_C_D_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote , which is having uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of D_C_ .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  It may need more actually , so y you you may need to check your battery usage it and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . And then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something and it can change the colour depending on your uh how much is the battery , well that is good enough to even locate even if you want to .
D :  Mm .
D :  It's true .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  You know .
D :  .
B :  'Kay good .
C :  Yeah so
D :  I don't know how if if I have time to talk about the
B :  Mm yes um I would
C :  You you have time some more ? Yep .
B :  Yes yes you can you can still . We have time .
D :  Okay .
C :  Sure you can you know .
D :  So what I'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a R_C_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . So the method is ther there is a a set of components in a in a remote control like , and uh what cost the the components in themself do not cost a lot but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , and I will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So there are two uh different types of uh um
B :  Nice .
D :  Two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control . Uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led that will uh transmit to the receiver . And uh yeah the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components um .
C :  Hmm .
D :  So you finding , just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key , and uh uh that's , with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor that amplify to make it stronger um .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . And uh so I think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know V_ V_L_S_I_ or F_P_G_A_ uh high technology , and this is important , and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them .
C :  Yeah mm mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So my personal design we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . If it's plastic or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit , veg or I dunno . Yes .
A :  Mm .
B :  Well well m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . So like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case . I mean just what
D :  Yes .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
A :  Mm just have a yeah
D :  Yeah like they do in with cars I think . Yeah inside the car yeah . So they also emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse . And uh very cheap L_C_D_s , so liquid crystal displays , so I'm wondering , I think we might be able to integrate L_C_D_ into our R_C_ .
A :  Just the veneer on it , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some uh compromise to to do . So we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range alright . And the display requires an advanced chip , which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , but I think uh with twelve Euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items , then I think w we could be able to handle that . So to to sum up um
A :  Hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  we need yeah so I I just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed and um and um assembly is a an important process that has to be taken into account . And uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the U_R_ exp U_R_I_ Expert so that we can it's really a team-working uh . So I I cannot design something without your agreement , right ?
C :  Sorry .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah so of course for example uh I wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the L_C_D_ display over there , or if you want to store a programmes with a keys
B :  No of course .
D :  Yes .
C :  What kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside
C :  W wh what
D :  Yeah it's kind of um simple pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . I think we could insert one that could underlie several functions of
C :  W what
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay so in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card .
D :  Exactly yeah , for customizing and yeah .
C :  Yeah where they do all the wi with with them actually . How f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So
D :  Yeah good idea .
B :  So I f I think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this . Um so I understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip , but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , so can we use same chip , so with one expensive chip
D :  Yeah .
B :  we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features .
D :  Exactly yeah that's a very good idea , we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle , uh it's called F_P_G_A_ chip , that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh L_C_D_ and yeah .
B :  Yes .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip .
D :  Yes .
C :  D well
B :  Do you think that's feasible ?
C :  Well I don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five Euro you know .
B :  Uh
B :  You th you think it's possible .
C :  Is it possible to fit in to that ?
D :  Yeah also thinking , I think both uh if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh Euros , it will be okay , but uh
C :  Sorry .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Well maybe we need specific costings then . Actually do maybe two designs and then cost them out and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better .
D :  .
D :  Yeah that's an excellent idea .
B :  Mm yes wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . That w that would be a very good idea .
D :  Yeah yeah . Yeah because right now I don't have price in in head but for next meeting I'm sure yeah be able to do that .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Good good .
C :  Yeah that's uh that's something which I wanted to ask you also , like what will be the each individually the cost of it . For example if f if you want to put wood I wouldn't suggest for wood uh 'cause it's I think it's m
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood . It will be much ch much expensive th though it's the most natural thing , but
D :  I agree on that . Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yes but I can I think uh I think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials which which come with a with another price .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah it's uh
C :  Yeah we we can give a preference to them , but it is but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for
B :  Do do you agree ?
D :  Yeah but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood , and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with uh graphs or I don't know uh User Interface Designer you could maybe uh help us on that .
A :  Mm yeah sure .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Ma I I think uh for next meeting we c you two can present a real design .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
B :  Uh so drawing it on the board .
D :  Perfect yeah .
B :  And then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh .
B :  So um
B :  Let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs , one one
C :  Yeah sure .
C :  Yeah we will uh
B :  one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Uh .
B :  Uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case which can be later uh fancied up with uh
B :  with addit uh additional uh , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it . But that that that that can be done later . We now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah customized .
C :  .
A :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
B :  Um .
C :  We can give them smooth keys , you know .
C :  Smooth keys
C :  with bigger s uh
C :  So that you know
C :  The the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , and every time we have to be very but if i the if we if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together to
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  So is there any of these that you're looking at particularly or is this just ideas ?
C :  Oh you can actually , for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , and uh now you can , for example , as I was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . At the same time , it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this R_S_I_ and all problem . Uh big keys may better for them actually and uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm yeah .
B :  Yes yes yes bi big keys is is good thing I think .
A :  You see ?
D :  I agree yeah , and not too m too many keys of course yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  No no .
A :  Mm well one I've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm mm mm .
B :  Mm w but then you have still have uh when you don't use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control which you don't use . So maybe it's possible uh , I don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Um yeah I've seen that before too . Anoth another like b it flips up and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yeah so it's something like this , the model here s you can put the keys
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  But I've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well .
D :  That's what you mean ?
B :  Yes I I th that's what I mean so I mean something
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  like like a book .
A :  I like this one . I like the shape of this one .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Can we have can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box that's a maybe curved or something .
D :  Yeah I like also this one .
D :  Yeah , the point is w maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or
C :  Yeah , mm .
A :  Mm mm 'kay . Is this for the next meeting though ? I think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting .
C :  We should make a
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah that yeah next meeting we should be
D :  Okay .
B :  Ju just make two designs ,
C :  Yeah that would depend upon us actually .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah .
B :  and the we we can decide decide between th those designs .
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah okay .
B :  I think that would be a good idea . So anyone uh any questions for now ?
D :  Perfect .
C :  No no .
A :  No .
C :  I don't have .
A :  So is this is there anything else I need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ?
B :  Um yes I come to that uh uh
C :  Maybe it would be interesting if you could look um
C :  for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that .
B :  Yes well m maybe uh , I don't know whether that's possible , maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay well is this me designing a way to evaluate it so
A :  Thinking about how to set up test groups and things ?
B :  I don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time but a as far as possible .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yep .
B :  So uh you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes
D :  Exactly .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email .
D :  Two or three prototypes ? Two ?
C :  Two .
B :  Two .
C :  One for like cost and the one with like higher-end so that then we can be easily comparing them or you know find a compromise between both of them , yeah that's how it is .
B :  I
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm and then
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah and find maybe a compromise .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yes okay .
D :  Perfect yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay let's call this to an end .
C :  Yep .
C :  Okay .
A :  Mm 'kay . Thanks guys .
D :  Thanks .
C :  So we are done
C :  for now .
C :  .
A :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So we are here for the concept design meeting .
A :  So , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken .
A :  Uh I will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards .
A :  So each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours .
A :  We'll then t take decision in concert and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting .
A :  So , last time we decided to have a simple interface .
A :  We also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . Channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple .
A :  We have also button for volume , and to switch on off the T_V_ .
A :  We have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no L_C_D_ no voice features .
A :  So now uh we will have three presentations . So the conceptual specification by Industrial Designer , the specification of the U_I_ by or U_I_ okay . And uh the last point is uh trend watching by Market Expert .
C :  Abdul al-Hasred is my name .
A :  So maybe we can start with uh industrial design .
A :  So this is the presentation .
B :  Uh , I_D_ you want ?
A :  Maybe I can switch slide uh on your request .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I only v have three slides , so . I just look at the mm
B :  um just this .
B :  On some web pages to find some documentation and I think a remote control is , as I s mentioned previously ,
A :  Yeah .
B :  you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button
B :  and in our case we are using a um a wheel control .
B :  So uh uh I was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh I just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button .
B :  And um yeah we can change directly . In fact I have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . The push button are usually extremely cheap , but I just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And I think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button .
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? Because we can afford up to twelve Euros for the price of the remote control .
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah I I th
A :  So will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve Euros to produce ?
B :  But I don't think that uh we should
B :  We should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . But
C :  Yeah .
C :  Also have to say Did you receive the email about the voice recognition ?
B :  Um that's all yeah . I haven't chec
C :  No ?
A :  You received something
C :  Yeah . You we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Says
C :  Yeah . It says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . But I guess it could be
A :  And could it be adapted ?
C :  I guess it's possible . I mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command .
A :  Okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ?
C :  Yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , so if they already have it as uh as a chip
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  then we we could use it .
A :  Okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news .
C :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm . Yeah but I think it's yeah Sorry , I haven't written my personal references . Um the I I just want to mention the the problem of the the r
B :  wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , and if we could reduce that .
A :  Okay .
B :  We we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I have a question about that actually . Um , what is the purpose of the light ?
B :  Just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber
C :  Is
A :  You can easily find the button in the dark or so ?
C :  But
C :  But in th in the dark uh
C :  Yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ?
A :  It will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control I think , no ?
C :  But if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it .
A :  Hmm .
C :  You can see the buttons better , of course . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . True .
B :  Yeah . Actually .
C :  But if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement .
B :  As soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light .
C :  Yeah , but you need another sensor for that , right ?
B :  Yeah . Again .
C :  Yeah no it's too expensive .
B :  I don't think that this is really expensive , but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
C :  Extra . Yeah , okay .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , but I expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , yeah .
B :  First of all I was thinking to have a a continuous light and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But it can be uh battery consuming , no ?
A :  To have the light always on ?
B :  Yeah , a little bit .
B :  A little bit .
C :  Mm .
A :  Well we will discuss that after maybe
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . So uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder .
A :  the other presentations .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So .
C :  It was last time I saw it .
A :  And it is .
C :  Okay .
C :  So , just move to the next slide .
A :  Okay .
C :  So basically want very simple , right ? That's the major idea , as simple as possible .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  So I just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . And let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . And in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Um . So .
A :  And also does it uh fit well in hand ? Because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage .
C :  Yeah . Well this these uh these remotes are quite big , so go to the next page , so .
C :  We have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part , and on the left one is exactly the same . So it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , yeah ? These are the basic thing .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So it's only the central part .
C :  So basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two .
A :  Yeah . With a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part .
C :  Yeah , if you have , for example I think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . It could be on the right side , for example . Yeah . Because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  And I think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because
A :  Okay .
C :  you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . Uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way .
A :  Okay . S
A :  Okay . Will be down or Okay .
C :  So that they're separate a bit , yeah . Uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either .
C :  Mm . Yeah , I think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user .
A :  Okay .
C :  Alright , you won't yeah . Usually what I have noticed that people put the plastic cover on things that you normally don't mess with , like buttons for t uh tuning the channels and stuff like that . Yeah . That you want to protect a bit .
A :  Okay .
C :  And I think it's uh it's reasonable .
A :  Okay .
C :  So , I don't think
C :  Yeah , this is just the the wheel . We could use the some wheels can be pushed down , could use the push down of the wheel for the record if we want .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh so we could just basically use one just wheel and uh user could use just the wheel to do everything with the channels in that case .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe the wheel will be a good advantage over our competitors .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Because otherwise it's pretty standard apart the fact that it's very simple .
A :  So maybe it's worse to uh to have more expense on that's that aspect .
B :  To s
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , I guess the market researcher will tell us all about that .
A :  Okay .
A :  So we can move to the Is there any question ? For
A :  designer of user interface ? or we can move to the next part , maybe , and discuss afterwards ?
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay , I can go ?
D :  Can I ?
A :  Yeah .
D :  So now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um .
D :  So , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . And um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative .
D :  And the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use .
A :  Okay .
D :  So , are things we are we have uh speak about before . Yeah . And um so you you can go
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  after .
D :  And there is a fashion watchers in Paris and Milan that have detected the following trends , uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures .
D :  So , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form something like that , or
A :  Okay .
B :  I support an apple .
D :  And the mm the material is expected to be spongy .
D :  Uh I don't know which material can be spongy , and if you
A :  Yeah .
A :  This is good also for
C :  Well , wou wou I think we can certainly just put the electronics in a spongy thing , it it would work , right ? Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think it is good also f to have a spongy material , yeah . Yeah , because it's robust .
C :  You can throw it to the television .
D :  Okay It's robust , yeah .
B :  Yeah . Me too .
C :  Hey that's a cool one . We could say that if you throw it , you have a sensor , and you throw it and hits the television and turns it off .
C :  When it d uh takes a shock .
D :  Not good .
A :  Yeah uh sorry ?
B :  Ah it's okay . I know that they do that for alarm clock also .
D :  An and and uh this uh you can yeah you can say that . You ca uh you can go uh before , before , yes . And you know here the more iz important aspect is the fancy look and feel , after is uh technological innovative , and after the easy to use .
C :  Yeah .
A :  No .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Before ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because I think no one else has . Has it ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah that's why Yeah that's why I think we have to keep that if it's possible .
A :  Yeah . I think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . So I think it's a good aspect and it should be kept .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Innovative . Mm .
C :  How do we make it look cool is the question .
A :  Cool , fancy ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  We have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable .
D :  Yeah . Mm .
B :  What about um
A :  Maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that .
D :  Oh , colour , yeah .
C :  Well the obvious thing is a banana , I guess .
D :  Oh i i
A :  Maybe yeah .
D :  I thought about a a pear , for example . You know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand and uh
A :  Yeah , and it's ergonomic as well .
D :  Yeah .
A :  A pear .
C :  The banana is also ergonomic .
A :  Yeah . Maybe pear yeah or something like that .
D :  Or a fruit like that . I dunno .
A :  Yeah . We can discuss that uh . D D Is is there anything you want to add ?
C :  Is there any fruit that is spongy ?
D : 
A :  I don't think so . I think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Something like that .
B :  And for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice ,
B :  with blue L_E_D_ inside ?
A :  But that's not in the trend . . The trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits .
C :  You can make it um
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  It's not hard , the metal .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well .
C :  Plastic .
B :  Yep .
A :  So , I think we can keep the wheel
A :  because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana wit uh any others idea you have .
B :  Yeah .
A :  What kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your T_V_ with ?
C :  Mm .
B :  Banana I think , it's a nice idea .
A :  Banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then .
B :  Because
B :  But
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  You y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , and here you have a a push button to
C :  Two of the button , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  But you don't have
A :  I think it's a good idea , yeah .
C :  Yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , yeah , and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side . So you can have it on on two sides and it'll be cool , no ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . Maybe we can keep the banana . And it will be very easy to find .
C :  You can put also vibrator inside .
B :  And everybody knows what is a banana . Basically . If you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha
D :  Yeah .
C :  Ah-ha . You can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . Yeah .
B :  Oh , yeah
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah it's really uh really a good point .
C :  I hope the students of management die , but anyway .
C :  Now who are recording this meeting ?
A :  I think it So
A :  One second .
A :  So we have to take some decision on this aspect . So , uh so for
A :  sorry , for uh component , so
B :  So
A :  we have to think about those aspects , sorry .
B :  So we will just use a a standard battery ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  And uh the chip we chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . Uh what do you mean by case ?
A :  I think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh I mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter . I just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it .
C :  The only th
C :  Yeah .
C :  Y Yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . But uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be I mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to I mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , right ? So , it's going to be bend a lot .
B :  Yeah yeah . Yeah .
B :  Spongy also .
C :  So if we try to push the buttons , it You think it's possible ?
A :  But
B :  Oh no I think it's possible .
A :  No the button would be In fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . This is uh like the
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay odd shape with spongy
A :  cover . And standard battery okay , a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . So we agree to put the wheel
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Wheel on the top . Button , where do we want some buttons ?
C :  Well , usually hold 'Kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , right ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  So it have to it has to be symmetrical .
C :  Uh
C :  Yeah but okay . Sa let's say that th o It has to be basically you can only take two sides , one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . Basically . Or you could use use this one , but I don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel .
B :  Yep . Yep .
A :  Yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable .
C :  This for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? Should have the two sides .
A :  Yeah I think it's okay for both right and left . Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So if the left , we have
C :  the op
A :  I think you can turn it this way also .
A :  You can do both with both hands .
C :  Wheel Wheel buttons . Yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side .
A :  I think it's okay .
C :  So you cannot see them .
A :  Well , you you will get used to it . And moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be
C :  Yeah I know , but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side .
A :  Yeah .
A :  No you you I think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty .
A :  I think for lefty it's okay . I can do this movement , and for righty as well .
A :  I think this doesn't change that much .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah ?
C :  Okay . Maybe .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So , for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side .
A :  And
A :  and uh a wheel on the top .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So the colour is yellow .
A :  I think it's uh we defined everything according to
A :  what we should what the decision we should take , yeah .
A :  So maybe we can um
A :  we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . So have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision .
A :  And have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product .
A :  That is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . It seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So
A :  so
A :  to prepare the prototype I would suggest that the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer uh work together . That would uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  be better , I think .
A :  And uh
A :  And so uh
A :  you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual .
C :  Mm-hmm . Yes master .
A :  So do you need to add anything ?
C :  No .
A :  You feel okay ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  You feel uh free to express what you want to say ? You don't feel too constrained ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  You don't feel free to answer this ?
C :  No .
C :  Maybe you can make uh uh mm okay .
A :  Okay , so
B :  Thank you .
A :  See you .
A :  Uh 'kay .
A :  So
D :  So so so .
B :  Put on your mic .
C :  So you forgot how this works again ?
B :  Boss .
A :  Yep .
C :  Boss .
D :  Maybe . Maybe maybe maybe .
A :  Okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , 'kay ?
B :  Yep .
A :  And here's the agenda for this meeting . Uh I'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . You guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product that I can see some demonstrations of over there . Looks cool .
A :  And then we're gonna evaluate it . Then we're gonna talk about finance , and I've got a lovely Excel spreadsheet that I knocked up in the last five minutes for this . And uh yep . And we're gonna evaluate the product and close . Got forty minutes to do this in . We should be fine . Let's try and keep this one on schedule . So
D :  Bra
C :  Hmm you knocked it up ?
B :  Alright .
A :  thing is in where is it ? Is it in
C :  Thi third third third .
B :  Three , three .
C :  The end product thingy .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Who wants it ?
B :  Pedro can have it .
C :  .
B :  I like I'll help talk .
C :  Um yeah so what we ended up with .
C :  Production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight Euros , someone forgot the units there yeah , uh unit price unit production price cost thing . Um
B :  Unit price .
C :  we implemented the basic functions , which is just T_V_ functions plus the locator , which was one of the marketing things , cradle , scroll wheel for uh the the channels , and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll .
A :  Zapping your favourite channels , eh ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Scrolling through your favourites list .
A :  Oh okay okay .
C :  Zapping you know zapping .
A :  Ah 'kay okay , that's favourites .
C :  Maybe it's just a Portuguese thing . And um yeah that was the result .
A :  Ah 'kay . I like the the the the logo on there as well .
B :  It's very prominent .
A :  It is very prominent . So this is the
B :  So here I'll give you the so this is the cradle unit , and this is the actual remote itself . Um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , um and then the volume controls are here and here . Uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . This is the power button . Uh we have our um we have the enter button and uh what was the other button here ?
A :  Okay .
B :  This is the teletext .
C :  Start s the the start uh to to to programme yeah .
B :  The programme button , yeah the programme button . So this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . So um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , and the red area is like a rubber covering . So you can see that when it lays like this or like this and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um
A :  Ah , okay I see .
A :  It's pretty cool .
A :  Is that could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ?
B :  Yeah that might be a possible
B :  a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it yeah .
C :  Not helping .
A :  Oh well I guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it .
B :  Yeah and it depends on if it's sliding , but I think it's pretty ergonomic . You can feel it .
A :  Mm . Feels good . I take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well .
B :  Yeah of course . Well this is clay .
A :  Yeah it's kinda cool . You have to reach a little bit don't you .
B :  Yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , but I think we might scale down the final model a bit . These this is a bit larger than it would be , but
A :  Ah yeah that wouldn't make sense .
A :  It's cool . I'm impressed .
C :  Don't have no one to handle that .
D :  Mm that's oh that's oh I like it . I mean you guys gave me more than I was asking for , so I'm happy because we've got some really marketable features in this .
A :  And hold it so wh what's the marketing perspective ?
D :  Yeah I think it's good . Good good good job .
B :  Mm Pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote .
B :  Beep beep beep .
D :  Uh pla
C :  The locator function .
D :  I'm ha
A :  Okay .
D :  It's great . That's great . It's a great feature .
B :  Um beep beep beep so beep beep beep beep beep beep be shut up . Beep beep beep okay . Um no no no tha that's alri
A :  Mm it's impressing . So let me get it , if I press this button
C :  Wicked isn't it ?
A :  I see . That's pretty cool . Hang on .
D :  So you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town
A :  I plan to do that as well . So the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in ?
B :  Exactly that's exactly what those are for . And um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , is um you could beep beep beep we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . And we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so
A :  Ah okay okay .
A :  Yeah it's the right shape isn't it ?
A :  But maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides .
B :  Mm .
B :  Right .
B :  So maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , but
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh , I can see that .
A :  But it's definitely got options for like different types of models and things as well based on that , hasn't it ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yep I like . Good job .
A :  So is that the the final colour scheme as well or ?
D :  No no .
B :  Oh no this is just what we had to work with at the time .
A :  Okay .
B :  So we'll leave the colour scheme up to the marketing people .
A :  The hmm .
B :  Careful .
A :  It came off . The scroll wheels , a problem with them not being sort of
D :  Well I mean of course , I mean
A :  I don't think the user interface guy wants to touch it anymore .
D :  My my s my suggestion is we're gonna go go to the silvers and blacks like most of the televisions .
A :  Mm .
D :  You know some blend of silvers and blacks .
B :  Beep beep beep .
A :  Okay enough of that . Well i it's cool guys .
A :  'Kay so are we done with the this presentation ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Ja .
A :  Okay .
A :  Now now .
D :  So you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there I gotta do mine up at the board .
A :  Have you ? Okay .
D :  Yeah yeah .
D :  So
A :  Can I not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ?
D :  No it's not in there because I had the computer problem and I I I cou I couldn't create it . I couldn't create it in the PowerPoint , and I think I've got this really strange cable . So what I had , basically going from the PowerPoint format , is that uh yeah yeah I like this a lot .
A :  Oh I see I see .
D :  Is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ?
C :  Nah .
D :  So what we had is we had the method .
D :  That's not how you spell method , is it ?
B :  No way .
D :  No A_ .
D :  .
D :  So this doesn't go so fast this way .
D :  And when I speak about method I speak about the marketing of the product huh .
D :  And uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . We've got the features ,
D :  we have the uh characteristics ,
D :  and we have the I I don't know what we would call the other part what we call you know the the the
D :  corp corporate
D :  Help me .
D :  The the corporation stands behind the product , okay . So the features I think we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . Um
C :  It fell off .
B :  Beep beep beep .
D :  the characteristics I talk about , we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . Uh and the corporation , we're talking about we're we're a new we're a new company . We're wanting to make a name for ourself . We're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price .
D :  One thing I would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? That was something I would be interested in . Um so yeah without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , I believe , to make it marketable I believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty Euros . We're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . Um w
A :  Do you would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ?
D :  That that would be uh that would be I think a decision best made by corporate um I I m for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , I th I think that that we can go after this and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm 'kay .
D :  But I'm sh I'm sure open to to market this in either direction .
D :  But you guys came up with a great product , and at that cost I think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . The only limitations I see to this is that we're focused on television only .
D :  Uh that's the only that's the only drawback I see to this . But with all of these other features I think people c one thing I'm I'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . There's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my D_V_D_ and my but I like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back .
A :  And we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? Th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that .
D :  Well one of one of the thoughts that I had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ?
D :  You know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . You know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after
A :  Hmm .
C :  W we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm , but you follow what I'm s I'm s
C :  We we w yeah we could get another version of it that actually works . But uh
D :  Yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , but that's that was just an idea I had . Uh to me the only additions
A :  Yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yep .
A :  Mm there's a risk of that .
D :  But anyway that's uh
A :  Okay so we can talk about finance now .
A :  So I have a little spreadsheet for us where I I was wondering , you when you talked about the fifteen point eight Euros , I was wondering how you came up with that figure ?
B :  Well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units .
A :  Okay so I have bit of a spreadsheet here for this .
C :  Very co very colf colourful .
A :  Now
B :  Oh .
A :  I've made a f few assumptions here in that I'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four Euros , equivalent to solar cells , which I think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . Uh and I'm assuming that the locator beacon , the you know the
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Uh-huh .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  beep beep beep .
A :  Can be made for it sounded different that time uh can be made for a similar price to uh an L_C_ display , uh an uh
B :  Oh , sorry .
A :  Uh do you think that's fair coming from a m the manufacturing ?
B :  Yeah um I do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , so there may have been a m miscalculation in there .
A :  .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay .
A :  So we're down to sixteen point four , yeah .
B :  And we and we have a single-curved uh
A :  Is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ?
B :  Uh I think that
A :  We're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur
D :  We've got a we've got a curve and a droop . I don't know whether that .
B :  It's single-curved , yeah .
A :  You think ? Okay I'm convinced .
A :  But we save one Euro that way , yeah ? So we come bring it down to
A :  Fifteen point four .
B :  See it's a little bit more than f single-curved . So yeah it's fifteen point eight , that's where we came up with it .
A :  Well hang on . Do don't speak so it's in here , in that w do we have any we have special form don't we ? So that's yeah . But the the the we haven't talked about any special colour though uh I don't th if we're going for greys and silvers then I don't think we're
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah we do .
B :  Ah . What do you know .
B :  Oh it's a that's not very special , it's pretty
A :  O okay so we're
B :  If th .
A :  Push-button , scroll wheel , we're basically we have uh th is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? Just a scroll ? It's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ?
C :  We don't
C :  It's a scroll .
B :  That's a scroll .
B :  Uh no we just use it as a scroll .
D :  Ooh .
A :  Okay then we have fifteen point eight Euros .
B :  It was a pretty accurate estimate I would say .
A :  It wasn't bad .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
C :  We're wicked . Awesome .
A :  Okay so
A :  we're on to the
B :  S 's kind of s frighteningly accurate .
C :  Yeah .
A :  We're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the
A :  presentation , where we have a look at the criterias th that Paul the criterion criteria that Paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell
A :  How's it going ?
A :  Anyone got any thoughts ? How how have we done today ?
B :  What ?
B :  I think we did pretty well .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I think we did pretty well too . That looks pretty spectacular .
D :  No , I think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept .
A :  Any other chang uh thoughts ?
A :  Okay so th th what about um room for creativity ?
C :  That was mm-hmm
A :  Is it the .
B :  Sh I think there was plenty of room . We got a couple innovative i
C :  Yeah .
A :  I I think we we ended up being quite creative there .
D :  Yeah well we we we kinda broke we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , we raised the price of it , we've added two t new technology to it . So you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us .
B :  Couple innovative ideas .
A :  Mm .
C :  No .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Not every idea necessarily , it's still a remote control . Uh no yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit I guess , but the uh
C :  Basically .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
D :  But I like I mean when I say we have we had I believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it .
A :  'Kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? No th th I think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing .
C :  It was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was
B :  Yep .
A :  I agree .
C :  Teamwork .
D :  Cohesive yeah . Yes synergistic yeah .
A :  Synergy .
B :  There was a lot of synergy .
A :  Teamwork , yeah he is uh .
D :  Yeah .
A :  What did we think of the meeting room , I guess is an important thing here .
B :  These cables suck .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , this falls off and uh the white board worked really well without any pro
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
C :  And that's
B :  Yeah .
C :  D you must have very long shirts . That's way far down lapel mic .
A :  Mm-mm , lapel . Wha okay , oh , alright .
C :  Lapel lapel lapel . That's almost a crotch mi cr
B :  Lapel .
A :  That's it's down , it's quite close .
D :  You know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th
A :  Keep it , keep it calm .
C :  Oh dear oh dear .
A :  Oh dear . No more pizza for me . So yeah the the pen came in alright and it's a little uncomfortable to use but I guess it works .
C :  'Cause this is you were using it o upside down . Still that
B :  That's our boss .
A :  Nah , I'm I'm not convinced of that at all . I've been wor I've been wondering about that all day , but see these look like they're that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . I don't care . Uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . What new ideas have we found ?
C :  Use them like that .
B :  Pedro's right .
B :  Pedro's right .
B :  Oh wel
D :  New ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or what are we ta
A :  Well let's do both then . Uh for the product ?
B :  Well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle ,
B :  and the r uh remote call feature .
D :  Oh .
A :  Yeah we came up with quite a bit .
C :  Bunch of new ideas .
A :  And for the meeting room , Has anyone got any more
C :  Yeah comfortable headsets would be nice .
A :  Yeah less sore on the ears .
D :  Well I I mean clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , but I'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that I don't know about . And of course I did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . It's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well , but I don't think that's the
C :  Mm .
D :  that's avoidable .
C :  Coulda been worse .
A :  Okay so
A :  Are the costs within the budget ?
C :  Mm n no .
D :  No .
A :  Nope . Oh hang on it really that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty Euros . No requirements are changed . We're still under twenty Euros to build , so we're good .
A :  And the costs within the budget ? Not the original budget , but they are now . Is the project evaluated ? Mm I think so yeah , then celebration as it says .
C :  Hooray . Free coke provided at the cafeteria .
D :  Okay .
B :  All right .
A :  Oh I don't know how that got there . Uh anyway .
C :  Who wrote that one ?
A :  Thank
D :  So we need to close this meeting , yeah bravo . Congratulations .
A :  Thanks guys .
B :  Good job guys .
C :  Cool .
D :  S I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on so let's close this and come back and 'kay .
A :  Yeah , I've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too .
A :  Oh .
A :  So let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . So , as the previous meeting I will be the secretary and we will have three presentations and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept and finally we'll close the decision . So I will first uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  No y you do the minutes first , or ?
A :  What ?
D :  No ?
A :  I I think I will let uh our User Interface Designer speak first , Mister David Jordan .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yep .
A :  So , we'll
A :  S technical accessoire ? Interface ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  No no no . Yeah .
A :  This .
C :  Mm .
C :  So uh first I will present the concept of user interface . Um there's three concepts in the user interface . So first one it's a Google controller .
C :  The second is a fancy controller . The last one is uh intelligent controller . So there are three concepts in our controller .
C :  Um n next I will explain one by one , the first is Google controller . Um , so I want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . So it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions .
C :  Uh this is a first concept of our controller . The second concept is a fancy controller , um so we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , so so the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
B :  A nice one .
C :  attractive . Such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides .
A :  I'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive . It's very big , yeah .
C :  Yeah , it's very , you know if you're
C :  Yeah . It's hard f i it's easy for you to remember it . Or to recognise it , yeah .
A :  Okay . Yeah , why not . We'll have big discussion I suppose after that , so .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . So the last uh concept is intelligent . We want uh we want our controller to be smart , so maybe we should uh use um uh
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . Um
C :  With this advanced features we I think we can attract a lot of user .
A :  Okay . Something else ?
C :  Okay . No . There this is the three concepts of our controller . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I just have one question , because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . Do you think they will be able to use gestures ? Because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , I think they will be bored after a while . You don't think so ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , so
B :  Yeah . Maybe .
C :  Uh I think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . For example , if you cannot find your uh controller , you can just uh just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two .
A :  Yeah , sure .
A :  I That's true .
B :  Oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so .
B :  One and
A :  Yeah , but suppose you got a cold . You have a mute remote controller .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  So you can use your gesture . That's no problem .
D :  Yeah but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ?
A :  Broken arm ?
C :  For limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very
D :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Yeah , but suppose you have a family watching T_V_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? Everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
D :  But this this but this would never happen anyway .
C :  Yeah , they cannot speak at the same time .
A :  Why ?
D :  Yeah
A :  If you have one brother and one sister and they want to watch their favourite uh T_V_ programme , so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , so .
D :  Yeah , but the
B :  Yeah but Yeah but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control because the
C :  Yeah , it's very interesting .
D :  Yeah but this
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I don't think it
A :  Yeah , but you have the remote control , so maybe you can keep it f with you . You're not you're not obliged to share it .
B :  That's right .
D :  Oh , okay , okay , you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff .
A :  Yeah , we can yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . Even you h you have the controller , I can I can say channel three , so it's c come to channel three , I don't have to
D :  No .
B :  It's it's
D :  No , but this is disadvant disadvantage .
A :  Yeah , I think it's a disadvantage .
C :  It's advantage .
D :  Yeah .
B :  And mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to
A :  Yeah , but one other question . How how much will it cost ?
B :  manual controllers , eh .
B :  No , more expensive maybe .
C :  How much ?
A :  Yeah . Because I suppose we need to do research to have something working .
C :  No no we we d we we just are use um
D :  Uh if you if if you use the basic
A :  Some some efficient .
C :  No no we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , we don't have to do some basic research on this field .
A :  So you think it won't cost an
A :  Not a lot for us ?
A :  Or ?
C :  Yeah , I think it's uh because uh this technology is uh
C :  um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , it's very
A :  Yeah , but uh uh
C :  it's uh yeah .
D :  But it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . Because then you need uh
C :  It's
D :  I mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example .
B :  Well y y you have also the language problem , you know when you
C :  No it's uh
C :  Even for the f um because the the vocabulary the
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  'Cause it it have to be universal , so .
A :  Yeah . I agree with uh
C :  The vocabulary is very small , so that's not a problem .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but there is one problem that uh Baba talked about is the international
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  remote control . We need something that is international . Suppose we're we want to sell it in France .
C :  Yeah .
A :  The recognition system will be able to understand French . If you want to go to England , it will be able to understand English , so .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation
D :  Yeah , this could be downloaded by the web maybe , or
C :  mechanism . It's It's it means when you when you sell this controller in China it's can recognise Chinese . It's r if you sell this controller in France it can recognise French .
B :  Yeah but you know . The product The pro
B :  It's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm , okay .
C :  Yeah , it's
A :  And with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ?
B :  Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah .
B :  But
C :  Because of this product uh this technology has already been developed . So
A :  Yeah , but how will you
B :  Yeah but the problem is how to s you know if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . If you have the language , you have to develop for each country .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  Oh n Yeah , yeah tha that's why we have to do language adaptation .
B :  Yeah , but for each country you have to do one , because uh the for example for Se
C :  Yeah .
C :  Even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to
B :  Oh really ? That's
A :  Oh . Seems to be quite complex .
D :  Yeah , but then w
D :  Yeah , we have to take care of the twelve Euros
C :  No , it's not so complex .
D :  problem .
A :  And what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? And where will be they ? Do you think if we're far from television it will work ?
C :  No no no it's not
C :  I think that's n that's not a problem because you you don't have to wear a microphone . It it just the microphone is embedded in the controller .
A :  Yeah , but where is the controller ?
D :  Okay .
C :  Where is the controller ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  It's in your family , in your home .
D :  No , but then it's it's like this uh
A :  Yeah , but we're here it's uh an object . But here you say you want to use i uh s technology .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah you can you can embed it uh microphone here .
B :  A microphone maybe .
A :  Yeah , but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . If you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . You just want to interact with television .
B :  To talk to the to the T_V_ maybe .
C :  Yeah yeah just you just put the controller here , then you
B :  I if you say one , he switch to channel , yeah .
C :  you use your command and you do s your gesture .
A :  Yeah , but you can lose it .
C :  No no it's n y if you lose it
B :  So well for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the T_V_ to switch to channel one .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay you so you can build a kind of black box and put it on T_V_ and just to recognize gestures and voice .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Ah .
D :  But you would still have the buttons . Or is it do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? Or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ?
C :  I think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user and we think yeah . You can see they can switch form one modality to another .
D :  Okay , so you yeah .
A :  Yeah , but
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , I dunno . It's a bit risky risky .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I think so . And maybe it will be quite
C :  No , that's quite inter quite attractive .
B :  But I think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , so although y y
C :  Well , if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem .
D :  Yeah , I dunno .
B :  Yeah but i i
A :  Okay .
C :  We should have confidence in technology .
B :  Yeah , we should .
B :  Uh .
A :  Hmm . So , what do you think ? We'll try the controllers you'd prefer .
B :  Mm .
D :  What ?
A :  Which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ?
D :  If if
D :  I mean , uh I'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . But if if if it like doubles uh
C :  More features , yeah .
B :  Yeah , but
B :  I think he need a control that is very reliable , so .
D :  no one would would be interested .
A :  So I think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller and to stay with the Google controller or a fancy controller .
A :  Maybe try to mix the Google controller and the fancy controller ? Hmm ?
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy .
C :  Yeah but if if you stick to um
A :  You think it's possible ?
C :  stick to the first two parts . So what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? There's no k features of our controller , so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  No , I mean
C :  Would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that
B :  It's not really the we we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . But uh I think a user need
C :  Yeah , you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , that's a function of T_V_ . You can replace your T_V_ with a new T_V_ with internet browsing function , but
D :  No , but you need you need new remote controller then . Because if you wanna browse internet or , I don't know , if you wanna type something , or
B :  Don't have a the the
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah if we can send email from it .
C :  But it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the T_V_ .
D :  No . No .
B :  Because the p the problem I can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if
D :  Cause for example yeah .
C :  Yeah , but we do we do we we we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . That's the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but uh we want so
D :  Yeah , you wou you would
D :  True .
A :  Yeah , but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone .
B :  Yeah
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , uh
B :  And for all the person of the family maybe , so , yeah .
C :  Yeah , if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ?
A :  You don't need to tune it .
A :  Yeah , why not ? If it's
D :  I mean , for example the goo y you say we would we would to have a Google-like controller .
B :  Because you have new
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  I don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like Google .
D :  Google is is simple , works fine , so I I guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Oh yes , but there's no big difference between the traditional controller .
D :  Uh thi this
D :  I mean , the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition or if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use .
C :  The then nn no . Tha
A :  Not too expensive too .
C :  But the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . That's the same yeah .
D :  See
D :  That's the problem , yeah . I mean , I I know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . But you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product and so .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Ye
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . So let's go to the Industrial Designer . Maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , so .
D :  I mean , that's the point .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Two ?
B :  Yeah , participant two um
A :  Working ?
B :  Yeah , working design , so .
B :  I think
A :  I can
B :  Can you go to the next one ? I uh it's not this one . It's uh oth the oth so I It's the working design . Sorry .
A :  Okay .
B :  Component design . So this yeah so this is the described use What ?
A :  It's okay
B :  Are you inst
A :  Uh I think there's something wrong with your
C :  It did didn't r receive it . Didn't receive it .
A :  Maybe you you record it somewhere else .
B :  I don't think so .
C :  Participant one .
C :  Participant one .
A :  Interface concept .
A :  No .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Mm mm .
B :  Oh .
B :  Maybe I record recorded directly on the
B :  Computer .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh .
D :  Dunno .
A :  Nope . It seems that we have a problem with the
B :  Okay , okay . Yes .
D :  I dunno if you remember what you had to say or
B :  I can say it to you without .
A :  Yeah , so
C :  Yeah , maybe we can first come to
A :  No , I think it will be more interesting to start with uh
C :  uh to Frahan . With Frahan , then you can prepare your slides , then present it later .
D :  I think it's more interesting what he says , okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , exac
A :  You will had s some more information in I think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um Baba's presentation .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , true .
B :  Yeah . In fact , I don't know , I s because i in my presentation I don't have here with so It was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r
C :  Okay .
A :  So .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , never mind .
C :  Okay .
B :  of the remote control . So it will be interesting so I could show you some some picture of what is inside and so .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  So I in fact the the f something I want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , so will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control or a a plastic remote control like this one . So and in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , so it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , or you have also some button like L_C_D_ where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . And
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  the other thing I want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation or will it be a battery like the classical battery so . And I think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  uh both of them , so so for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in S Senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con It can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , I think it's an added value to the remote control and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers and but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , no ?
B :  Yeah , yeah mm .
B :  Ecologists , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  In fact , having them both will if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , but it will be an added value also that will be compensated , so hmm .
A :  So .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  And what tha what about the uh
A :  materials ?
B :  And the materials , it depends for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more the plastic material is more common it's very resistant but , you know , something wooden will be like , I don't know high cl so a special high class , or you know , you can have some
A :  Impersonal , mm-hmm .
D :  Special for
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood and it can be interesting .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm okay , seems to be interesting , mm .
B :  And so the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap
B :  integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , it depends , but I think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module .
A :  Yeah , we want something easy to use and so I think maybe something very low level wou would be enough .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
A :  And you think that we will be
B :  Yeah , I think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve Euros , so .
A :  Okay .
A :  So wood . And what about the buttons ?
B :  I think the buttons I pr I prefer , you know , the L_C_D_ you know lighted buttons because , you know , it's I don't know um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion and it's related to how beautiful it is or uh if you want to watch T_V_ in the darkness or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness it's very easy so , right .
A :  No it's fashion , yeah .
D :  What about the touch scr touch screen ? For example . It's it's expensive I I guess .
B :  I think a touch screen
B :  will be t as expensive as the L_C_D_ buttons so . But And it is a kind of other design , I mean . It can also be interesting to have this kind of
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  So you got email ?
A :  I dunno . I think we have only uh five minutes left . Participant four ? Functional requirements ?
D :  Okay .
D :  Uh no , trend watching .
D :  The other one .
A :  This one ?
D :  Yeah . Uh , I think so , just
D :  Yeah , so just to meet the user requirements I would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market and to kind of um
D :  have a better overview of what's the fashion in general I've checked more than only the remote control market , so next .
D :  So again , it's pretty much similar to what I've said in the previous meeting . Um user really really want a fancy look and feel . They're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , okay . Like the one you've shown , David , with all the buttons and I mean i i it sounds good technically but it's it's not what they want and uh
C :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
D :  So , second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on .
A :  Okay .
D :  At the same time , it's important that it's easy to use .
D :  So that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . Now i if we look at fashion in general um
D :  Okay .
D :  Wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , okay , so I think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing .
B :  Ah yes .
B :  Yeah , yeah . Okay , yeah .
D :  'Cause it's it's really what people want . Even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control .
D :  And then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . Uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . Then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . So we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from Milan and Paris
B :  Okay .
B :  And fruit and vegetables yeah .
D :  we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . And the other point I haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , okay so this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design .
B :  Spongy 'Kay .
B :  Okay , yeah , yeah .
D :  I dunno .
B :  Yeah , but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ?
D :  Yeah thi this is this would be like um
D :  plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh
B :  Very stuff Okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . Yeah .
D :  device , so um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , tha tha that was the main point , I think , from the trend
D :  in fashion .
B :  Okay .
A :  So we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . So , as you say you want something technologically innovative , maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , maybe will attract
B :  Yeah .
B :  Solar .
D :  Yeah , so when I think it's
B :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  It will be a
A :  pro-ecology consumers . Uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I think
B :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
A :  Case .
C :  Later ?
A :  So you think case .
A :  Something spongy . Someth no wood .
B :  No wood but Plastic ?
D :  Maybe not no wood , but I mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know .
B :  Would some
A :  Maybe you
B :  I think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . It depends on the design we want , so .
D :  Yeah , maybe the base .
D :  But still y
A :  It's it's natural .
B :  Yeah , it's natural and i
D :  Yeah .
A :  Th The feeling is natural , so maybe we can stay with wood .
B :  And it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , you know , saying that it's ecol
D :  Yeah , I mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view .
B :  Mm , yeah , it's not right , so .
A :  But it's still fashion .
D :  But we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , or I dunno .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , something that you can into it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh and what about the user interface concept ?
B :  Google and
A :  Google and fancy ?
B :  and fancy , f how about the the voice ? And
A :  Because I think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some
A :  disadvantages with this .
C :  Uh yes .
B :  Uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested and how
B :  It It is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . The smart controller .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah . But and the problem is I I'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the T_V_ , so speak directly to the T_V_ and you don't need a remote control actually , so .
A :  Yeah , but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice .
B :  But it will be embedded on the T_V_ and not on the remote control , so .
A :  That's true .
D :  Yeah d
C :  Okay .
D :  I dunno .
A :  So maybe we'll just focus on the Google controller plus the fancy controller , maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  It's good .
A :  And L_C_D_ buttons .
B :  Yeah , L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah , I think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add .
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
B :  And pf what can we think a supplement to
D :  What interface ?
A :  Yeah , for the interface something added value .
B :  I think the supplement can be the voice . It is just , you know , it is not the most important , but
B :  it can be a part of
A :  With a module ? You mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use
B :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers .
B :  Yeah . Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  To push button , yeah , yeah . Even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . Yeah , turning yeah , yeah . Not very complex commands , but easy commands , so .
A :  Turning the T_V_ o on o or off .
A :  So , adding some vocal commands .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Simple ones ?
B :  Yeah , simple ones for
A :  Okay .
A :  So the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes so we'll you will all have to work in
A :  in your direction . So you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . Uh you will have to work more , Baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
B :  expensive buttons Yeah , to make some new
B :  Yeah .
A :  And I sup I think we'll have to evaluate th the product too .
D :  Yeah , no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , fruits .
A :  Yeah .
D :  If possible .
B :  Okay .
A :  And remember as as I said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . So you will have Baba and David Jordan you will have to work together on the prototype and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , so you will have to model model something .
B :  Need it to be , okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay . Yep
A :  And I think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  So , no more questions , we can close the session .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Sounds good , mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Okay , cool .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay ? Good afternoon . Hope you have good lunch .
C :  Afternoon . Yeah , we had falafel .
B :  Hi .
A :  Oh . Nice .
A :  And you ?
B :  Uh , yes , I had something similar
B :  but non-vegetarian .
A :  Okay . So today is um
A :  our third meeting . It will be about the conceptual design uh . If I come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings
A :  um . We decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons and we are not decided about u the use of L_C_D_ screen on on the remote control because of costs . So maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . Uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point .
A :  So I hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us . So each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform um who starts ?
D :  Okay , .
A :  So marketing .
D : 
A :  So you are you saved your y your presentation somewhere ?
D :  Yep .
A :  So you're four ?
D :  Four , yeah .
A :  Which is trend watch .
A :  Okay . Mr Marketing Experts .
D :  Yeah that's me . Uh . Well I investigate the preference more d I investigate deeper the preference of the users . Uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh sorry the current
A :  So
D :  the n
D :  current trends ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah ? Okay . Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well wha what I found um can you
A :  Next slide ? Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Thank you . What I found in order of importance from less to more important is that
D :  people want an easy to use device .
D :  After they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , but the most what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current
D :  the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . So now more more cool aspect , ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh also
D :  Well in in Euro in in Paris and and Milan the in Paris and in Paris and Milan the the current trend of uh of clothes , furniture and all this
D :  all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables .
A :  Mm .
D :  And also in the in the U_S_A_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy .
D :  Spongy means eponge ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so
B :  What what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ? What you mean clothe
C :  Spongy means it it's like sp
D :  Fruit vegetables is the the new have you seen the last exposition of clothes in Milan ?
B :  No , I missed that one .
D :  Yeah , I I didn't miss an I didn't miss and I saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes .
B :  Oh , they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay . So we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana , just maybe
D :  No no , not not yet , not yet .
D :  Yeah , yeah . So te textu textures , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Vegetable textures and all this kind .
A :  Drawings of bananas .
D :  Uh yeah , yeah .
B :  Okay and
A :  Uh-huh .
C :  But what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ?
A :  Well so this is in the next slide certainly .
D :  Uh no no , it's not . It's
A :  It's not ?
B :  So which fruit are you thinking of ?
D :  And
D :  Um .
D :  I ha I haven't thought of any particular fruit , but the general aspect of the of the remote control
D :  may may could remind some kind of vegetable , some kind of
D :  instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But yeah it it depends on the
A :  So maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the L_C_D_ .
B :  Oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit , or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the
A : 
C :  Means buttons are in the shape of fruits , buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that .
D :  Yeah maybe the shape the shape
D :  No , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . So we shouldn't be at re really attached
A :  Apple for channel one .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  to to the trend but
B :  So something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant .
D :  For instance , yeah . African or as an elephant ?
C :  That we can discuss afterwards .
B :  But okay , I'm not , I'm not really sure
A :  Okay .
B :  if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , maybe just to fashion gurus , like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , but I don't know about uh I dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is .
D :  Well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing .
D :  I think in my opinion we should focus on on young people because they are more open to new devi new devices and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was
B :  To fruit ?
D :  was was able to
D :  to buy a a n a cooler remote control .
B :  But is it uh is fruit cool ?
A :  That's a question .
D :  What ?
D :  What ?
B :  Is fruit cool ?
D :  Yeah ? Uh
D :  Is the new trend
D :  of the
B :  Well I guess , you know , Apple has the iPod so , imagi just 'cause they have an apple on their
B :  on their product , doesn't mean fruit is cool .
D :  No I think we we should think about a a shape with it a device with a shape of some
B :  Okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know , you don't wanna pear or a watermelon .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ?
B :  Well , probably the only thing is a banana that I can think of , a cucumber .
C :  Banana .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I dunno .
D :  Or m
A :  Maybe too long .
B :  Maybe . Too green .
D :  Maybe .
B :  So , but I mean you also have to you have to also have , fit r all the buttons and you know .
A :  A banana .
D :  Um
B :  It's , it
D :  Yeah .
B :  The thing is you have t normally with um with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build .
A : 
D :  Yeah but I li I like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so
C :  I don't th it will be rolling a lot .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a L_C_D_ on a banana also .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh do you want a an L_C_D_ with twenty five Euros ?
A :  Well , you're the Marketing Expert you should tell us if it is too much or not .
B :  Well , this is
D :  I think
D :  Well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , so , I will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the
A :  So
A :  So you you you suggest to go f
D :  new inputs and also it's I'm not convinced about this L_C_D_ because you need uh internet connection , you need more things , it's not just buying a new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying uh
A :  Okay .
A :  S so you're simply you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons .
D :  more things . It's not so simple .
D :  For instance , yeah . Yeah for for for given an an example yeah .
A :  Okay good . So maybe you can go ahead ?
D :  Yeah no , it's what I already said .
A :  Okay .
A :  Thanks . Um .
A :  Okay , I'll give the floor .
A :  So you are User Interface guy .
B :  Okay .
A :  So you're three ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  And it's this one .
B :  Yep .
A :  Go for it .
B :  Yep . Okay . So .
B :  S next uh slide .
B :  Okay . So I received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control .
C :  But it's just a speaker right ?
B :  It's no , what it is , it's it's very
C :  It's not a microphone .
B :  It has a has a microphone , has a speaker , it's got a little chip and it allows you t
C :  Mm-hmm . Actually I'm not reading microphone there , so that's why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you .
B :  Well , it's a sample sensor sample speaker .
B :  Sample sensor sample speaker . It means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . But uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase . So , I mean , you know , I guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control . But basically the thing is , we have this technology available
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
C :  In-house .
B :  in-house . So , um but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components , so um it it but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B :  Whilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it ,
A :  I there's something that I
A :  unclear really understanding . Is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ?
B :  It's it it's no , well , it's it'll recognize uh I guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . You train it for a certain uh , for a certain phrase , you say the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is , you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ?
A :  And it's just to , it's just to playback something ?
B :  Yeah . So actually that was a bad example , 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so .
A :  Yeah yeah . So this is not s really to do to to do control .
B :  Only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an
A :  Yeah . This is just more like a poi pois yeah .
B :  It's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing , but I guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh
A :  Yeah yeah .
A :  So it it's c uh it it it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view .
D :  Yeah but you can u
B :  Completely pointless yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , unless you know , you like having conversation with your remote control .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah but the can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ?
B :  Well yeah , that's the thing , if you can but you have to pro though I think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that kind of logic in it . So
A :  Yeah yeah . So this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it . So this is out of discussion . So if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , that would be some development work .
B :  Yeah .
D :  M Mando .
B :  Banana-mando . Banana-man
A :  No this is mm banana-bando , yeah . Uh then it could be cool yeah .
D :  Banana-mando yeah .
C :  Yeah okay , let's go ahead .
A :  Okay .
B :  I uh I I I don't think it's worth it though , I think it doesn't really add much to the functional
B :  design and it's it's it's not mature enough
B :  to use as a speech recognition engine , so
A :  Okay .
B :  Um , yeah . So if we can just move on to the next slide , I've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control
A :  It doesn't look like a banana at all .
B :  Well , you see , I was I was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus , um , so at the moment it's more of a box focus .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit .
A :  But you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to
B :  Yeah , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But um , I've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , 'cause I think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know , I think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing , so .
C :  Stable thing , that's right . To have , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B :  But I think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , because it's it's the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B :  But um , I've also included this turbo button because I think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , and well so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the T_V_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh
D :  What's a turbo button ?
B :  Might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . Or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing .
D :  It con it controls the speed ?
B :  Yeah , so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if I'm if I'm going if I'm scrolling past them and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever .
A : 
B :  So yeah , that's um , those are the two important uh features I think we need on the remote , but I mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  You know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , I mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of
B :  thing that doesn't have that much functionality , it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana and it's still very it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , so , um you know , what other buttons do we want ?
A :  It's enough .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I mean we could have well , I guess you need an on and off switch , but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing .
A :  Switch on . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . So sounds crazy . I like crazy ideas .
B :  That's why you're a marketing guru .
A :  Okay . So i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the L_C_D_ thing .
D :  Yeah , of course .
B :  Well , that's the thing , as have we decided that we can only spend , uh , twenty five Euro ?
A :  I think that
B :  Well not spend , but you know , charge twenty five Euro .
D :  I I think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so .
A :  No we can we can't use that .
D :  You we can ? We can't .
A :  We can't use that to
C :  Communicate .
A :  to comman co communicate , it's just a thing
D :  Yeah , but we can say channel twenty five . No ?
C :  It's one way .
A :  No .
B :  But then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels , you have to be able to to recognize
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  It's not a lot one hundred templates , it's not
B :  Mm .
B :  Well , I f I think it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Ah , it's designed for a cof okay . Is it design for a coffee machine ?
B :  Well that's its current application , I would presume that it's kind of , they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . Maybe you could ask your the you could ask the engineering department if we can
A :  Yeah . A good good good thing . You want to g to move to your slides ? You're finished ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  But uh
C :  Yeah , that's right , yeah .
B :  Well I just I just made the point , I don't I don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , I think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment .
A :  Yeah I think so .
B :  But um I did have one thing from a previous meeting , you were talking about um being able to find the remote control and I was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well . It might be useful to have some kind of base station , even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say I'm here but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping
A :  Mm .
A :  Exactly yeah .
C :  So it's a speech synthesis kind of thing , something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out .
B :  It's speech
B :  It's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of , not really speech recognition , but kind of pattern matching , yeah yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . That's right .
A :  Oh , good idea . Very good . Okay , let's move on .
A :  So you're two ?
C :  That's right .
A :  Okay .
C :  So this is going to be about the component design . So first thing is we need power source for the remote control . So I was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , one is the usual batteries which are there , they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing and on top of that we can have solar cells , when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , there should be some flexibility in t
B :  I guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . So there should we should think of something like that and then it should be double curve .
C :  The s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . Then controls for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them .
B :  So , just one second , when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? You reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard 'cause I'm not sure
C :  Double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if I'm right .
C :  So it's symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is .
B :  Okay , but like , kind of convex or concave ?
C :  So , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want .
B :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
C :  So there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . These are the three things , and there are different materials , with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve .
B :  Okay .
C :  So there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , but plastic is I think is the most appropriate one , it'll bring the cost down and anyway it's
A :  Yeah .
B :  Although , you know , wood
B :  could be uh quite a stylish uh option , if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on .
A :  Mm but i but there is no elasticity which could be
C :  Wooden cases
B :  Well it depends , I mean , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken , it's the inside . Yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user .
A :  Yeah but the components inside .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Very too expensive to do .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  And also uh
B :  And I mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well .
A :  Yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood .
B :  That's true , but are we set on the banana
B :  idea ?
A :  Well it look like it looks like you are all targeting that yeah ?
D :  I was thinking that the
D :  the shape of a banana is not
D :  it's not really handy .
A :  Yes it is .
D :  Uh I don't know the name o o in English uh
D :  This it's not a fruit it's a vegetable .
C :  Is it an e apple which has
B :  It's like a pumpkin or
A :  Yeah ? Pumpkin .
D :  Green .
B :  Green .
A :  Green . Um um um , yes I see .
B :  What does it taste like ?
A :  Pep pepperoni .
D :  And you put in the salad .
B :  Ah yeah , is it what's it in French ?
A :  Poivron .
D :  Oui c'est ca
B :  Yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . Yeah .
A :  Uh pepper .
D :  Pepper .
A :  But um they do d
D :  And it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of
A :  Yeah .
B :  I don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like
D :  No , I mean in a
A :  Yeah .
A :  It's not re it you you think it's really fancy and fun ? You think that young people that are
B :  like with a banana you can have
D :  I'm sure it's fun .
A :  Yeah . More than a banana ?
D :  But banana is not so handy , I think that's handier .
C :  Banana is more handier as compared to this I think , and to capsicum .
B :  Well
B :  But like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top and just
A :  Yeah .
B :  roll it back and forth like that , but with uh I don't know how you would hold a capsicum and
A :  It's kind it's kind of it's more uh it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls . Okay let's move on . So time is running , let's move on .
D :  Yeah you're right .
C :  Okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , just and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . These are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company and we we can go ahead with that .
C :  Yeah , we can go to the next slide . Then uh there are different kind of chips , one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . So we can have regular chip for control . Pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip .
A :  Okay .
C :  And uh regular chip supports speaker support , so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced .
B :  So is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of
C :  It could be a beep kind of thing .
B :  Okay , but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ? Okay .
C :  Yes , yes , that's right , it's it's onto the chip , most most probably , not not hundred per cent sure about that .
B :  Okay .
B :  So are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ?
C :  That will be the volume control I think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined . It should be whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better . As or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , so that
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . So that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside .
C :  That's right .
C :  Okay . Yeah . So these these were the component selection and these things . We can go to the next slide .
C :  And uh these were the findings which I I saw with the web web , that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , so our T_V_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like V_C_R_ D_V_D_ players which are usually attached with the T_V_ , because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us .
B :  Although , if
B :  It depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device . Cause that , you know , that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type .
C :  Mm .
C :  Of fruits .
C :  Mm-hmm . Remotes objects , okay .
A :  S objects .
A :  Crazy objects .
D :  I think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits .
B :  Well , you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place .
D :  No but I think just one fruit to control everything .
B :  Like a power fruit .
D :  A power fr a power M a Mando , a Supermando fruit .
C :  And uh as well as I could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s and we should have it on the remote .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , good .
D :  Actually I I didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control .
B :  Well
C :  So you're having a basis station .
C :  Okay . Your usually your remote sits on that . So you and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries . Now let's say
D :  So you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station .
A :  Bu it's it's . You s you you thing .
C :  Basis station is with the thing .
C :  It's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . So now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost .
C :  So you're having the basis station and there is a button , if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . Uh
B :  I think that's a pretty handy feature .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , you know .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
B :  So
D :  Yeah but I'm a bit worried about the budget .
C :  Uh this is basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Although you do need to include R_F_ kind of circuitry in the remote .
C :  That's right . But all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems . So component cost is going to be the least . Anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , L_C_D_ has already been ruled out , A_S_R_ has been ruled out . So it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly .
B :  Okay . I'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , I this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? You know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver .
C :  And
B :  And um , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely
B :  kitsch . For better want of a better word you know ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  You think that yellow it's kitsch .
B :  Well , you know , I don I don't know how many peop
A :  If you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana .
D :  Yeah .
D :  No , I I
C :  A yeah , otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then . It's neither a banana nor a
B :  Well they
A :  O otherwise
D :  Maybe li like that .
B :  Yeah , like this colour this colour
B :  Maybe , you know , maybe like still in the shape of a banana .
A :  Roughly .
B :  No , exactly . Exactly . Um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana and just kind of , you know because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . I think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Let's move on . Uh uh yeah . Before before st before ending the meeting I'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype . Go for it .
C :  And uh going to the last slide .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  Well no , not not you , you can finish your slides before
C :  Okay . Okay , so . Anyway , users'll be so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes . So that was very I thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody . That's it . Yep .
A :  Mm okay .
A :  Okay . That's all ? Okay , so mm so well done for the presentations . So we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do . So I I propose that you go to the whiteboard and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product and uh where Superman go banana and uh uh extra func functionalities such as wheels , um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device , I do I don't remember you call it ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That's right . The basis station . That's right .
A :  Basis station , yeah . Uh so um so we're going for a stylish
A :  banana shape .
B :  Yeah , so , I guess you wanna hold like the way the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor .
A :  Yeah , right .
B :  you know , so if you have like
D :  What about what about this shape ?
D :  More or less .
C :  There's less space on this to put with the buttons .
A :  I if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . If you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult if you don't have to do it in fact , it's better . So ti time is running , we have to we have to we have to to move forward . So let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but how many buttons do we need ?
C :  Uh what about a
B :  Okay , so
A :  So we have this . We have a a basis um , how do you call it ?
B :  So
C :  The base station .
A :  A base station . We'll have a base station extra uh on the side .
C :  Right .
B :  okay , so I guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana
B :  shaped object .
A :  Yeah . Uh , we have a R_F_ for um for beeping for beeping . We need b R_F_ to beep . So we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis .
C :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
C :  That's right , yeah , we need that , yeah .
B :  Okay , so it's uh
B :  Yeah .
C :  Basis station . Yeah , yeah .
A :  Basis station , thank you .
B :  Alright , so we need uh okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Can you go quickly please ? Okay . So we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels and your tur turbo turbo uh button .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , which I think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device , so you have
C :  Turbo button .
A :  Yeah , on the th yeah , maybe here . And the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance .
B :  Yes .
B :  Yeah , so you have the thumb kind of here . So yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel . And , uh
A :  And and you have two wheels .
A :  Okay right .
A :  Good .
A :  So no L_C_D_ .
B :  No L_C_D_ .
A :  Okay great . Um .
A :  Very good .
C :  Okay .
B :  Oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Uh for the remote ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Oh , just the switch , no f not for the T_V_ for the T_V_ . Uh so you
C :  Remotes don't have power on off switch .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . S no , that'll be controlled by the those buttons'll be there already , yeah .
D :  What a
B :  Where ?
C :  Means on the remote .
A :  On the side .
C :  Because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons . They are not going to cost you much , everything is in-house and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this .
B :  Okay .
B :  Well , I dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote
C :  Oh , yeah . That's that's another issue which I didn't think of .
B :  in the first place , you know .
B :  Y I mean you need to kind of keep it um
C :  But you know our targets are very high , means fifty million Euros is the profit which we want make .
D :  What about
B :  Yeah , how many of these did we wanna sell ? I can't remember , what was
C :  Twenty five . Twelve point five is the profit on one .
A :  Twenty five .
B :  Yeah , but how many units did we need to to sell ?
C :  Uh forty th four .
D :  Four millions ?
C :  Point point four million ?
B :  Four point four million .
C :  Point four million .
B :  That's a lot of fruit .
C :  In the market .
D :  What about a
A :  Yeah .
A :  So . Well . No . Time is running , we have to close the meeting in a few minutes . So , okay , the next step , you can come back to your seat . The next step is to go for to f is to go to uh
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
A :  to building a prototype , based on this , okay ? So next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things . You have to uh work on the look and feel uh design and you have to work on the user interface , in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype .
B :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh Marketing Expert uh have to go to product evaluation .
D :  I wo what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ?
A :  Okay ?
A :  It's too difficult .
D :  It's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative and I don't know if it would cost a lot , just a few five words .
A :  It's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , so t it's in the next prototype so let's skip it .
B :  Uh .
D :  Okay .
C :  For the future prototypes .
A :  Yeah , maybe , for the n if if if it it works well , we'll go for uh an orange one . Yeah yeah , honour the fruit .
B :  That can be the t
B :  That can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando .
D :  Plus plus , okay . Maybe objective banana ?
A :  Okay . Thanks very much . We'll see n next meeting . Bye .
B :  Okay . Yep . We have to go design the prototype .
C :  So meeting's over ?
C :  Okay . Okay . Okay . Thank you .
D :  Thank you .
A :  Thank you .
C :  The problem is after all this meeting there is
A :  Hello , uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control .
D :  Hello .
C :  Hello .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept and I think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision .
A :  So , uh
A :  we will have again three presentation , from all of you , and uh I hope it will be fast because I would like to have time to
A :  for long discussion and
A :  and decisions . So , who wants to start ?
C :  I s
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
C :  No , no , you you can start .
A :  So start , uh
D :  Okay , I'll start . Can you open my presentation , please .
A :  Uh .
D :  I'm number four .
D :  Trend . Yep .
A :  This one ?
D :  Can you pass the mouse , please . Oh okay , that's fine . Okay . Um so basically I just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . Um
A :  Turn .
D :  the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in Paris and Milan . Um so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . Um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority . Secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . Um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . Um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well , but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  From our f fashion people in Paris and Milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . So , I'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . And also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy .
A :  Okay .
D :  Um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way .
B :  What does it mean , spongy ?
D :  Uh sort of um squishy . Um . Yeah soft , like a uh like a sponge . I don't know . Yeah . Um so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , um has lots of technolog tech technology in it . Um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel . And that it's easy to use and from our last meeting our you know Fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the Real Reaction company . Um .
B :  Like soft , or something ?
A :  Like a sponge . Yeah .
B :  Okay . I will see .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , uh yeah . Easy to use , is it uh
D :  That's it .
A :  a as much as important than technology or fancy thing . It's less important , right ?
D :  Less important . So um fanciness first and then two ti you know , half as important as that is technology technology , and half important as technology is easy to use . So .
A :  Yeah yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  So , Hamed , can you .
C :  Yeah . The second one . Could you please show the presentation number three .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I think the biggest struggle will be the easy to use feature . We'll see .
A :  Um . Number ? Three .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Three .
A :  This one ?
C :  Yes .
C :  Just Could you please check if it is the first one or the second .
C :  Uh , n n no , it's the first one . The second one .
A :  So it's not this one .
C :  Uh yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay . So I am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . I think uh I think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . Um generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . So , the more frequent buttons should be larger , they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . And uh s uh I can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . It should be we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control .
C :  Okay . So what I found out that uh as I said uh I think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . Uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand . It should not be completely like uh a cube . It should be it should have round edge , so uh then it's easier . And maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . And uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy .
B :  Exactly .
C :  Okay . And my personal p uh preference is uh , as I said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . Usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . And if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this .
C :  Uh . And also uh I think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . Not on remote control . I dunno if I can explain well . But uh just inside . For example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . So it can be another uh preference . And uh I dunno but uh I think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . I know that it consumes lots of energy , but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . And I think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . So it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it .
C :  Uh I personally think there should be a big difference between uh between something . Otherwise they prefer to buy something which is coming from a famous company , or .
C :  Okay . That's mine .
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh okay , so good news from me uh uh for me from Hamed , but bad news from Bob obviously , because spongy design , I don't like it as Okay , so could you please , Fabien , open it .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I'm person two .
B :  And which one , uh probably the first one . I'm not sure but check the first one .
B :  I Most of the things I have to write myself on the board , but Yeah , that's it . Just
A :  This one , yeah .
B :  It's only this slide ? Yeah . This this is just uh one thing I wanted to mention and show you that I just uh I just found this , that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers or I'll just Yeah , seven seven inch T_ T_F_T_ screen , which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . Uh so I I probably draw it down raw scheme . This is this is the stuff that I can use to Okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view .
D :  Inch .
A :  Oh , .
A :  Oops .
B :  Uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , no uh I'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . So there will be some circuit uh for the power .
B :  So , say power circuit here . Uh the main energy will be taken from batteries that we can uh uh And if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , which I found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . I was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . So no problem . There can be also solar cell . Uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . So at least seven to seven .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It depends where you put your screen , because the screen is uh seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . It doesn't matter . Um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . So this will be T_F_T_ . And on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere ,
B :  say here . Interface to the microphone . Then the graphical card uh for the T_F_T_ and the third unit is the I_R_ . The good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , so it will be very cheap for us . So infra-red here . So the once again the overall requirements , seven to seven centimetres for the board , which has to be which can be spongy but has to be this size , and the T_F_T_ which is seven inches . Um I have to check what I wanted to
B :  Uh from my point of view I don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device .
A :  Can you fit any uh for example a T_F_T_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? For example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , I can I can imagine it could be a problem .
B :  A all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . But we have to take care of the T_F_T_ . Well , sponginess . Maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the T_F_T_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , I dunno .
A :  Yep .
A :  Okay . So
C :  Well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside .
A :  Okay . Maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around . maybe after .
B :  Well , it's maybe related to the U_I_ . A Yeah , that's all from me .
D :  So
A :  Yeah .
D :  Can I ask a question .
D :  This seven inch T_F_T_ screen , how big is it in reality ?
B :  Yeah ?
B :  Well , seven to seven inches .
D :  So like that .
B :  Yes .
D :  That's quite big .
D :  Uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this T_F_T_ screen ?
A :  No , I don't think it's seven by seven , I think it's seven the diagonal is seven . Usually when they say seven inch I think it's the diagonal . Yeah . I dunno I dun I dun One each . But , yeah , .
B :  Yeah but
B :  To be honest , I was
D :  But I mean even even that is like this big .
C :  Yeah yes .
C : 
B :  Yeah , honestly speaking I was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , but it's seven inches . But I I think we can we can cut it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  You can cut the T_F_T_ screen .
A :  Let's go .
B :  Yeah , no no problem , because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . So
A :  So let's cut the T_F_T_ .
B :  Yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen .
C :  Mm .
D :  Okay , so
B :  So so for the same price we have four screens now .
A :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
A :  These technical engineers , huh .
D :  So , what's the size of the device ?
B :  Ah well this is like this is almost nothing . Seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something .
D :  Even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still
B :  Yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know .
D :  Is it Can you hold that , or ?
B :  Because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know .
A :  What user wants . He wants a small remote control , or ? Uh uh with big buttons . It's difficult . A sm
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah , a small c control that they can hold in hand .
B :  I thought that it it should fit in the hand or something .
C :  Yes .
D :  But is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ?
B :  W I I think so . I if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow Well , that's that's no task for me , but well seven to seven at least yeah , but
A :  So maybe you can finish your presentation , and afterwards we will discuss about all this .
B :  Oh , okay . Okay thanks .
C :  Maybe this .
D :  Okay .
A :  That's it . Okay . So .
A :  No .
A :  Uh , so I think we have a lot We have to take decision today , so I think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . Uh first I think energy it's a key problem because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . Because can we have L_C_D_ and speech recognition with battery , and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ?
B :  Not
B :  J uh just a point to the energy th things . If we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for L_ uh speech recognition and L_C_D_ , so no problem in energy , I think .
A :  Okay . So Okay .
C :  So but
B :  But we have to use the solar cell . Otherwise not .
A :  Uh like but using how many batteries , for example ? Are are what Maybe what is the size of the battery
B :  Yeah I was thinking just common A_A_ cells .
A :  Okay . Uh one two
B :  So like three to five centimetres , I dunno exactly , but .
A :  Okay .
D :  So if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching T_V_ inside ?
B :  Uh d doesn't need to be sun . It it's just the daylight , you know .
D :  Okay .
A :  The television lights .
B :  Yeah well I I suppose that I suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  At least when there is T_V_ you can get light from the T_V_ . I dunno .
B :  Yeah from the T_ I don't think it's enough , uh .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Mm .
B :  Ah it's a it's a compromise , no ?
A :  At least it's new and maybe technology New technology . Yeah .
D :  It's it's quite innovative , yes .
B :  Yeah , that's why I wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Um .
D :  And if you watch T_V_ outside it's very useful .
A :  So I think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . Uh what what are gonna be the size , because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . For example for the for the L_C_D_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this um a such a a a screen .
B :  Uh the s the screen is okay , but the board , uh that's the problem .
B :  Well what what would you guess as a shape ? Or what what would be the shape ?
C :  Mm .
C :  I think I think their being uh large or small is not important . The only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . So let's say an average size , okay , and it should not be very heavy also . And I prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . So we c it's like like some joysticks . You can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . So the general shape should be like this . I think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . So uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's I think it's that's my opinion . It's easier .
B :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Which is the same area .
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Could you re could you redesign your board ?
B :  Five to ten . Well that
D :  Oh , five five centimetres by ten centimetres .
B :  Yeah , right . Yeah , I think it's feasib Well one um um How could we do it ? We could put the board next to , well , under the L_C_D_ and for example make the L_C_D_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . Like holding something , and the L_C_D_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . Well But maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . Well fi five to ten it would be feasible .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Oh .
A :  I've I s I think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller L_C_D_ , if it's possible .
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay , so five to ten , I I think it's it's feasible . I'll make it .
A :  Okay . So we are agree with a small
C :  Or uh or I don't know but I don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . So using some L_C_D_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , I dunno the name , L_C_D_ responding to fingers . Touching the screen . Something like Mm like tactile .
B :  Fo Five by ten .
A :  L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Tactile or something , yeah . Touch screen , yeah .
D :  Mm , touch screen .
C :  So But for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens I I think we using a a smaller screen is better , because
A :  Yeah .
A :  The problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So
A :  So let's go for a small L_C_D_ .
B :  Okay , so
C :  A smaller s
B :  Yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me and I will work it out .
A :  Yeah okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  So , five by s ten .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Um so what about , so the case we talked about . Um something easy to use , you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ?
A :  My first idea is because
A :  our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , I thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and
B :  Seven to ten banana .
A :  A big banana .
B :  Okay . Rather mango or something or .
A :  Um .
D :  Well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . I mean what other what other fruit and vegetables Do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ?
A :  Yeah . Yeah . But it's just an idea . I dunno what you think about , but
A :  Yeah .
A :  I dunno if it can fit with the technology . You are the specialists of that .
B :  You mean banana .
B :  Well , but
B :  If it's If it If the banana is big enough .
A :  So
B :  Then , yes .
B :  But if you want to look at the screen , no . Well
A :  Yeah , and
C :  I think this is not good .
A :  The screen has to be square ? Or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves .
B :  Well , it can be whatever you want . But if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . But if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so .
A :  It could .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  It's like more more expensive to have shape like that . But I don't care . You know , if we fit this requirement .
D :  Well
D :  I'd like a shaped screen . I think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the T_F_T_ screen .
B :  Okay
A :  Okay okay .
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one . But
A :  Yeah . Yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana .
B :  Like modified banana , okay .
B :  Well it we'll stick to banana , or ?
A :  So we are agree with the banana thing ? Okay .
C :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , banana's good . Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-mm .
A :  So , the last point we decided it's infra-red , I guess . Everybody's agreed .
C :  Yeah , I think infra-red .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Sure .
A :  Uh , so that's it I think about the concepts . You have other thing to add to this point , or uh no ? So , uh about the user interface , so we are going to use L_C_D_ . In the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons .
A :  I don't know what we are going to do with that . You talked about the buttons on the side
B :  Like like peeling of the banana you s
C :  Yeah , peeling of the banana .
B :  It would be cool , yeah . Peeling of the banana , you know , should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden .
A :  Mm what ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Okay . And you mean the first layer would be spongy . So Is it is it possible to do that ? It would be a great idea , but is it possible technically ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  First layer obviously spo Yeah , w It's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah I think .
C :  Uh
A :  Like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it .
D :  I think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , some
A :  Yeah .
C :  Something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , U_S_B_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . If you see it's like peeling . You open a plastic cover and you see some U_S_B_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . So keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . So , something like this .
A :  Yeah , but do you see that as a
A :  rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or .
B :  Well is it possible to make it soft ?
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So I think if it's so then it's cool ?
A :  So , I dunno what you think , Bob , but it would be great for users I think , and very good for marketing .
D :  I think for sure . Definitely . The softer the better .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Cool .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Honestly speaking , I cannot imagine it , so far , but it will be terrible .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
B :  Mm .
A :  And setting buttons
A :  hidden in .
A :  Mm , other remarks , or something , or .
A :  Something we didn't talk about yes yet , or .
A :  I think
A :  we are almost there . Uh maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing ,
A :  like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , I dunno how to do that technically , or .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And how
B :  Pof .
D :  We could use Velcro .
A :  Yeah , maybe .
D :  Or uh ma maybe a magnetic
C :  Yes , yeah it's a good idea .
D :  thing .
A :  Ma magnetic oh .
C :  Magnetic .
C :  Mm . Yeah or a Yeah it can is it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely .
A :  Okay .
C :  And when you try to open it , it will be opened easily . So you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana .
A :  Okay .
A :  And what would be the matter here of the first layer I mean ?
A :  Mm . Likes .
A :  Soft plastic , or
D :  Yeah , I imagine some sort of vinyl thing .
A :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
D :  In a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel .
D :  Maybe .
B :  Well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept
B :  kept in the shape , we cannot b uh So we need that the that the peeling
B :  I dunno but we should we should take care of these two two things . So , if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . So that we can reach the energy out of it out of that .
D :  Mm . So you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and
C :  Mm .
B :  It is possible , but , well if it
D :  And a and a banana .
C :  Mm .
B :  I dunno . I dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . But then it must be some window there , you know .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
A :  And something we forgot , maybe , uh about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ?
C :  Yes , I think . I think so .
D :  I think it's important . I think One of our p priorities is tech technology . And
A :  It i Yeah , it seems feasible , and it would be something very great . So we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , and we have also the technology thing w will be . And even the easy to use thing , so it will be perfect . So we add also the speech recognition device .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I agree .
A :  So , that great . We have decided everything . And think we are on a good way .
A :  So , um
A :  uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes .
A :  Um , so uh the the Industrial Manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . The User Interface uh uh Mana uh Manager will work on the user interface device . And the the Marketing Expert will do the first project evaluation .
D :  Okay .
A :  So , I hope you can do that in thirty minutes . And uh , yeah , I
A :  uh I think you should work together , s you uh Hamed and Peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype , and uh
A :  more about the shape and so on and how you can manage to put everything together . And um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on . So thank you all everybody , and see you in thirty minutes .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay . Thank you .
B :  Okay .
C :  Thank you .
A :  Okay , so now we are on the conceptual design meeting .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh y getting close to the last is the penultim meeting .
B :  How was lunch ?
D :  Thanks Don't be sarcastic . Mark .
A :  Mm great .
A :  So um I will again do the secretary part uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first Rama then Mark and then Sammy . Um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts and we have forty minutes .
D :  Uh Rama .
C :  Ramaro .
B :  Mm .
A :  So what we want to the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . And also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . And at the end um Sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing . It's
A :  So , let's go . First
A :  with Rama .
A :  Participant two .
C :  Yeah , participant two .
C :  Component .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yep .
C :  So we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . For energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . First one , we can use simple battery , or we can use traditional solar cells or mm and the material we can have plastic , rubber which is good for this R_S_A_ and then uh titanium , which can be which have very good look an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d L_C_D_ display . And we can use some , moving kind of thing .
D :  Ah .
C :  So , as we discussed before , we need to we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control .
C :  So this can be simple kind of programmable chip and which can use microphone sensors . And we also want to look at our remote control , so . Still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve Euros or around that . So we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house .
A :  Mm-hmm , okay .
C :  So uh we discussed an
C :  Excuse me .
C :  So we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells and so we would like to just use simple battery . And also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or and well the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  What is a double-curved shape ?
C :  Like you can have two curves .
D :  Uh-huh .
B :  Why ?
C :  Uh it's I think in manufacturing I guess it's problematic .
C :  So , we want to go for simple push buttons because it need a simple chip and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to L_C_D_ which are uh which needs advanced chip technology and it's more expensive , since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition we want to reduce uh cost .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um I want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light .
D :  The cost .
C :  Uh
C :  Uh
C :  And also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things and
A :  Okay . You m titanium it's more uh
C :  Yeah .
B :  W we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium but there are some rubber or I dunno some rubber parts like to make it feel better and to you know
D :  Mm like this ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yes so mm
C :  Like in cell phones recently these you can with the rubber in four directions and yeah . But full assembly
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay .
C :  We'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . And this push buttons we we would like to use push buttons instead of L_C_D_s and so we want to mo I mean we're we want to put speech recognition so we want to reduce price on this technology and so that we can have enough space or enough money for
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh yeah so
A :  Okay , s so simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated .
C :  S S
D :  Speech
C :  Y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , so
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay , and still we have mm can we still include the L_ L_S_D_ display ? L_C_D_ yeah L_C_D_ .
D :  L_C_D_ .
C :  Uh l
D :  Seems not , it's either L_C_D_ or push-button .
C :  So uh it's like a
B :  No , it's not gonna be a t no touchable but still like a source of information or source for menus .
D :  Ah .
C :  Yeah maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design then if we have enough money or like for and because the speech recognition technology will take at least five Euros or or something so we want to reduce the cost on display or this inter
B :  Okay , so let's try it , let's t
D :  The L_C_D_ would
D :  The display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . Just uh for output , yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah , it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that can we we can consider , because like it won't take much money I guess , because
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  Okay , yep . You have any further questions or ?
A :  Mm .
D :  I guess no um . So the batteries uh are going to be very light .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , we're to go for li and now I think we have many options in the market so we can go for small nickel or alkaline batteries for
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
C :  really light batteries and with uh good price .
D :  So this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , instead of clapping why not just be ask .
C :  Yeah , that's then the the one thing we want to know is like because remote control is used for like in the household so it it it will be it m maybe at least five , six people want to use it so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . If we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome and we need really m more technology and so
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , for the location .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah , if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  So let's now go to the you don't have more question ? Um mm thank you mm .
D :  No , it's okay . Puts less of constraint on what we can do but
B :  No more questions .
C :  Yep . Thank you .
B :  Mm yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  it's always like that . We have dreams and the in the end we find out that it's not feasible .
A :  Yeah , but mm .
C :  Oh . We have uh some limitations .
D :  Anyway .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But still uh L_S_D_'s already quite nice , L_C_ I'm an artist , sorry . So uh , that's not I hope that's not too much . Okay . Uh participant number three .
D :  L_C_D_ . L_S_D_ is something else , and it's quite nice as well . So , go on uh artist .
A :  Okay . Um yeah . Now let's talk about uh interface .
A :  Three .
C :  Three .
B :  Uh
A :  Which one ?
D :  Hmm .
B :  mm uh have a look at this no it's yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh so the concept of the interface . Generally I developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for
B :  possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your T_V_ and remote controls . So let's start with this . We got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons and uh we got explanation for every button and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons and um the L_C_D_ is going to be somewhere here
D : 
B :  and uh go back button , I don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , and um power on and off mm I I don't remember so uh it it it should be maybe this button is power on and off ? Or no ? I can see nothing . So that's our concept . It's called the millennium remote control .
A :  Mm .
D :  Let's change millenniums .
C :  So maybe you can use in the end and
B :  Yeah .
D :  doesn't make sense . This is very ugly .
B :  Really ? I thought you like it . Ah okay just press the button , please uh .
D :  Oh no , too much concept .
D :  Ah .
A :  No .
D : 
C :  Uh
B :  Yeah , we will not use this . We will not use this . But instead of this I will devise That's our concept .
D :  Ah , back today .
B :  And it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already
B :  we already discussed . And uh what will people say ?
A :  Mm-hmm . 'Kay .
B :  They'll say it's perfect . Or what will say ? Uh they will say it's splendid . And uh e everyone will say I'll buy it . And everyone's gonna be satisfied .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Do you think it can come in several colours ?
D :  Or did the
B :  I would make a backlight of the L_C_D_ screen with different colours .
D :  Um but not the case .
B :  Not the case .
D :  Uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , like
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Because apparently from your survey people like colours , no ?
D :  Yeah , well they like uh something which is uh
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , so let's remember there's a Nokia phone which changeable panels .
D :  Mm yeah , okay , so that would be the option . I don't know I don't have a Nokia phone , but
B :  Do you like it ?
C :  But it's uh
D :  I don't use that but again , uh I might
B :  That's why you don't have it . That's why , 'cause it's nasty .
D :  Yeah , bu but
C :  But it would be expensive , no ? If you use colour L_C_D_ .
B :  No .
C :  Uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . Maybe we can just if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  uh the shapes and they can have different assembly .
B :  Um , I am here .
C :  So users have different I mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so
A :  Okay .
A :  So ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So we can just if they want they can just pay another
A :  Uh-huh , okay , so you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on L_C_D_ , yeah .
B :  'Kay .
C :  two Euro .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah yes . If they want like uh so that we can yeah .
D :  Kind of upgradable uh remote control . Wow , wow .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Just they'll get few more
C :  things and few more colours .
B :  Okay , what uh there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , like they can reflect different colours
C :  Lights , yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  And thermodynamic also . Mm-hmm .
B :  depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Like a chameleon .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah yeah .
B :  We can make it in fact . If if if the okay .
A :  Yeah but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah . But uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version , but
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm , so
C :  Yeah .
D :  Because uh I think there are two kinds of people . Those for which the remote control is uh
D :  is to be uh something useful uh I'm going to talk about this later but and those for which is something that that that uh is uh specific to them so it it's like a signature . My remote control is pink . Nobody else than me has a pink remote control . And that makes me special .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay and you think that we don't have to make to make them pay more because of uh o or this is
D :  I think I think they would be ready p ready to pay more for that .
A :  Okay , so
D :  Those who wanted to have it pink .
A :  so i it's not uh a s base service it's a
C :  Uh
D :  No mm no .
C :  Mm .
B :  So , be an option , yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  It might be optional , yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  But those people will be really few , no ? So like we can those
D :  The the young people the young people want to be different from their friends . Although similar but have something just slightly better . Pink
C :  Ah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So m so maybe that's if that it's a selling point maybe it has to be the base .
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . But you know if you want to be different you just take your remote control with you all the time .
D :  Mm . Yeah .
A :  And you'll be different . Uh in the train uh , hello uh no . Want to change my neighbour .
D :  Yeah , yeah . You always have your remote . Oh , you don't ? Yeah . You don't have your remo
B :  And it makes you different , you know ? Anyone has their remote controls here ? No ?
D :  Wh you you know like for instance take the iPod . It's a kind of remote control . Uh it's white and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere . It has this distinctive look and feel and look which people seems to like just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . White .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Uh-huh , uh-huh . Could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Seems important .
C :  Hmm .
B :  That they can use it in darkness , like .
D :  Mm glow in the dark , so
B :  Hand light , yeah .
C :  Yeah maybe like the infrared like we can put some
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  radium chips or something so that like at least um yeah . Yeah , that
A :  Iradium ? Ah sorry . Mm .
B :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay . S well , let's go on maybe with the presentation . And um the remote control's going to be smart but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ?
A :  So mm
D :  Yeah . Uh-huh , yeah sure .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Oh .
B :  And uh
B :  I dunno that's a question to you and to mm to
D :  Well so I heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done uh so that's the smartness of the thing . Currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition but we may have remote controls with speech recognition .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay , okay .
D :  I dunno .
A :  Mm , that's a nice world .
B :  So just just just just think about it um .
B :  Thank you .
D :  Don't touch the remote . But yeah . Are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? So for instance the young guy would not be able to use it because his father doesn't want . Like with some
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh yeah I just want to say it should be real smart .
D :  Maybe fingerprint recognition or
B :  Voice recognition is quite tough . I say don't use it , and the control just looks .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um
B :  'Cause I ordered jus
D :  Mm .
B :  To l to l lock it .
C :  Uh that mm that could be feasible I guess , like
D :  Okay .
C :  So since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use yeah .
D :  So it could be
D :  smart in that way .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  But for instance th I I'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . S since it it knows who is using it , it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that and provide you ways of using them , I dunno , somehow , I dunno , that might be expensive but
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , sure .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh it's
D :  that might also be a good sales pitch again . The remote that knows you .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  Okay , thanks .
A :  So it's yeah , Marketing Expert .
D :  My turn ?
D :  Okay , it's alright .
A :  Participant two ? Four , sorry .
C :  Four .
D :  Four , I think . Trend , yeah .
D :  No uh yes .
D :  Okay , so I'm going to talk about trends and um I hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . So , next slide please . So first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends so it's not so uh simple you might think that it's easy but uh it's not so simple . Anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , so have to
D :  to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . We can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired .
D :  Of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired because in fact they're not only watching the trends , they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . I hope I'm going to try to help you on that . This is more risky because you're not following the trend , you try to invent it , which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . So anyway uh next slide please .
D :  Uh to be to be quick there's a lot of words here but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . The first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . And uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . It has to be fancy .
D :  Strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing which we w may think that would have been the most important , which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . So as you see uh it first have to be very nice , s something that people are proud of uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours .
D :  And finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . Next slide please .
A :  Mm .
D :  Uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . If we look back and not uh look at only remote controls I think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas so currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like Paris and Milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel or so . And I think of course uh i it applies to everything . That's the thing with trends . It it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea . Fruit and vegetable . Think fruit and vegetable . And uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , yeah . Well this so so I think uh uh i
C : 
A : 
C :  Mm .
B :  What is spongy ?
C :  Yeah kind of um maybe
D :  When we were talking about rubber , I think uh the rubber aspect might be important because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess .
C :  Yeah it
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So maybe titanium it's not a good idea .
D :  Seems not , seems not .
C :  We need to think about mm mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  So
A :  Um sorry Mark . It seems to be
D :  Think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , as a even in the shape it has to be more round and uh
C :  Fruit .
C :  Even shape ?
C :  More yeah .
D :  more uh uh look natural somehow . I mean
A :  Mm-mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
D :  So that's what people seem to yeah i I know it's quite far from what you thought but that's that's fashion and
A :  Hmm . You're old-fashioned . Sorry .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay that's all I have to say .
A :  Mm you have questions ?
C :  So these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? Or it's
D :  These I'm sorry .
C :  This you you so did you
D :  Yeah , yeah we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , as you know our company is quite big and uh so I'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends that are also well .
C :  Where ?
C :  Oh . Oh , okay , mm-hmm . It's not from mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . It's more general trend it's not particular to the remote control .
D :  No , it's not it's not this this is very general , yeah . But it seems that trends travel across things . The what we
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah but some materials n they're to be
C :  uh they're to be something like solid like they can't be really spongy or yeah yeah .
D :  Sure . Yeah . We have to I think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables but we still have to put our chips inside , so of course . This is your problem . This is not mine .
C :  yeah , yeah sponge , yeah yeah at least that's
C :  Yeah yeah that yeah yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , looking yeah fruit . These things can be easily incorporated . We can have t colours or this shape or at least yeah .
D :  Yeah , I think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . If if it's something like rubber made or I think it it's also going to be good .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay ?
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  No more question ?
A :  Okay .
D :  Yep . Thanks .
A :  So
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . Um now you have to go straight on this individual action which i which are for Rama uh wil design , um Mark the user interface design , and uh Sammy uh the product evaluation . Uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay .
C :  Look and feel de
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Mm sounds interesting .
A :  Mm-hmm um
A :  and I as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Thanks .
C :  So , can we highlight the specific features of our yeah , so so we want the speech recogniser and we want some kind of buttons and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , that's we want to follow general trend .
A :  Yeah you're right , you have to
A :  So you say s
D :  Spongy .
A :  S do we agree on that ? Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  We have to .
C :  So , do you think
D :  No , we don't have to , but seems it's the trend . Again , as I said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . So there's no
B :  So we have to uh for
A :  No .
C :  Hmm . Yeah .
B :  yeah so are we confident enough on creating trends ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Well , that's you t can try to convince us .
B :  Well , we can make it smell like fruit . Yeah .
D :  Okay . that's a good idea , I
A :  Okay , that's a good idea . So titanium smell like fruit . Mm-hmm .
C :  That's
C :  So what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? Or they really like
D :  Uh
C :  They more want these fancy features like
D :  I think i yeah i it's again in this uh what I said first it has to be fancy so I think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it I think it's a good sell for us because we have it and others don't . It's fancy . Whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Feature
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I I agree with uh this uh
C :  Yeah .
A :  Now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . Do we take titanium smelling like fruit , or do we make spongy
A :  uh fruity-like
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh we will try to explore these two options and yeah yeah .
D :  Maybe you could explore the two option .
A :  Mm . Yeah , yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . Could we make a titanium shape ?
C :  Uh yeah at least like we can make banana or
B :  I mean fruit-shaped .
A :  Don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape yeah .
B :  But
B :  Doub double-curved .
D :  Mm . Seems to be .
C :  yeah it's it's yeah that's a we're to look for and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive and d
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  Okay , okay .
B :  In fact I just agreed to make uh
B :  to make the like titanium panels
B :  on a whole
B :  rubber body .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Well , okay w we'll see .
A :  Mm-mm . Okay , so you explore now that you're going to work together these these two . Or or spongy an yeah .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . Maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or
A :  Mm .
B :  We'll see . We'll see .
D :  If you have time .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah I don't think w I think we have to choose .
A :  If we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy but uh it cannot be both .
C :  Uh .
B :  We'll see . I I really don't like this modelling clay 'cause you know it makes some for for I dunno uh yeah um we'll look .
C :  Yeah .
D :  For creation .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Ah you can pretend that it's uh titanium .
C :  Even design .
D :  You can paint it afterward . No problem . We have a very large department of paint . You will do it .
B :  Okay , okay .
A :  Yeah , do don't worry , you you you speak with mm mm .
B :  Alright , alright .
A :  Okay . So explore a shape .
C :  So still we want to keep L_C_D_ ? Or
A :  Mm I think it's what we say , that we have an uh an L_C_D_ with uh information . Not uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  The thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are .
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , then we can
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  yeah , yeah , that user friendly or
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  That's the converse to having zillions of button where each button does only one thing .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  and we just stick with two batteries so it's not any solar or yeah yeah j yeah , because
D :  Yeah . Classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel . Anyway it's very in general I think people uh change T_V_ more often than batteries of their remote control . So . Because the trend goes faster than the life of the
A :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So it's very
A :  Okay .
A :  So are we mm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  We're done .
C :  Yeah , we're done .
A :  Okay . So see you in thirty minutes .
C :  Yep .
A :  So we come to the third meetings . I have
A :  good .
A :  Um so in the last meeting we have discussed the functional design and now we will talk about the conceptual design .
A :  So we
C :  Okay so I think I will do my presentation on the components concept so can you please uh open uh
A :  will talk about some
A :  specific details .
C :  I'm participant two .
C :  Components design .
A :  This
C :  Okay so uh the first thing uh I have done is to to made a review together with the uh manufactural uh department and have which components was uh available to build a remote control . So for energy sources we have we have to choose between the solar energy , hand dynamo and uh kinetic um well uh kinetic uh technique to to store the energy . We also um we also can put a regular battery in the in the remote control . Now
A :  Uh this is what we have decided in the last meeting . But if we use battery
C :  Yeah b uh f well uh I meant uh by by battery I meant uh I will not have a uh a wire between the remote control and the energy source but uh I didn't fou we didn't decide yet which kind of battery
C :  we will put inside the the remote . So uh it's a point to discuss . Then uh the case material we have uh uh also several choices , like wood , rubber , titanium or latex . But uh well
C :  it's not a a re uh well a real issue for the from the technical uh point of view .
C :  Concerning the interface uh we can we can put mm just simple buttons or scrolls or buttons uh much more complicated , but it also requires that the chip to process the button is more complicated so . And uh this is the last point , the choice of chips .
B :  Mm .
C :  So what I have f found is that I think basic battery or kinetic uh energy uh collection is the is the better way to provide energy because I think solar energy wi won't work in a cluttered uh uh environment .
B :  Mm .
C :  So um so I think we can start with these two main things . For the case uh well uh I think that uh titanium is um is a good choice because it's trendy and it's uh it's uh well it's modern and uh user are are are mm will be uh very happy to have a a a nice remote . For the interface uh I think that we can ach achieve uh all the desired functionalities by s just uh using uh rubber buttons , simple buttons and th thus this allow to use a regular chip that are uh well cheaper .
B :  Mm .
C :  And s so uh we can move to the next slide . Yeah .
B :  Sorry . What is this single curved what does it mean ?
C :  Well uh uh i i it's uh it's the the shape of the um of the remote . You you will have the well um the the curve will fit into your hand when you grab the
B :  So it's it's not
B :  Yo l yeah . When you hold on it , it is comfortable to hold .
C :  Yeah . It's more confog f comfortable that if these uh it's completely flat .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . And the battery , is it kind of a rechargeable or it doesn't matter ?
C :  Yeah the um that's the point . The kinetic one is uh y you can recharge uh by the um
B :  That that's what it means by kinetic .
C :  Yeah and by well by just by moving the ar uh your arm the mm well the remote will uh accumulate energy . But I d I don't know it's if it is feasible because I don't know if yet if if the user will move enough to provide the remote um all the necessary energy .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . We we might check with our R_ and D_ department to see if they have this product ready for market .
C :  Yeah . And yeah and so can you go to the next slide please . So and uh that's uh that summarize well what I have said .
B :  Mm mm . Wha
C :  So uh you're right we can uh see in our uh R_ and D_ uh if the kinetic metal is sufficient to provide enough energy . That's it .
B :  Ah the department .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh
B :  So I um keep in touch with the R_ and D_ department .
C :  Oh yeah I take care , it's all right .
B :  So the titanium case is the normal case that I'll show you some pictures that I have and you tell me whether they are titanium case or not . 'Cause I am not very sure , plastic , titanium or whatever . There's another point I want to make , is that the uh well you've seen them I le na my presentation that um I point out some why buttons are not the mm
C :  All right . Yeah .
B :  not the only ways you can use
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , maybe n
A :  We will , okay .
A :  Three .
B :  Yeah .
B :  So the user interface is uh
B :  i it uses the aspect uh of a computer system , a programme which can be seen or heard
B :  or otherwise perceived by the human user and the commands and mechanism
B :  the user uses to control its operation and input data . So you s this gives you the ways to input data and we have uh we are more we emphasise more on the graphical user interface here . The idea is to represent buttons as figures , diagrams , symbols and on so you you can easily when you look at the symbols you understand what it is doing . Yeah . Yeah . So .
A :  What's the function of this button .
A :  I think it makes the the interface really
B :  Ea easy to use .
B :  So next one . function five .
A :  Graphical user interface .
B :  So I can use the button , the mouse maybe .
A :  A graphical user interface emphasise the use of pictures .
B :  Yeah .
B :  So next line . So the here are some examples . So they cluster the buttons together .
B :  They group them into col they colour them and uh they have different forms as well .
B :  but this interface are kind of confusing .
B :  Uh basically there are too many buttons .
B :  Right . Next one .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So some people are propose voice recognition and
B :  so ah by the way I receive an email from the from one our departments saying that the voice recognition has been used in the coffee machine for this by a company when you tell the you say good morning coffee machine and the machine are reply to you . So I just got an email saying that . And it seems like this voice recognition technology is ready to be used so we might consider that ,
C :  Mm-hmm mm mm .
C :  Yeah fine .
B :  supposedly . The next one .
B :  Mm so somebody some people use uh some people use a spinning wheel th with the L_C_ display so instead of using the mm buttons you have a L_C_D_ screen and then there you can u you can use that as buttons , you can use that as real so so that could be an option as well . Touch screen , I mean . Next one .
A :  Yeah .
B :  And some people propose a scroll button .
B :  Integrated with push buttons or you may have scroll button instead of p just the push button . Like the one we have here .
B :  Uh , next one .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  so there are a few aspects that I collected here .
B :  So s basically this deals with special users , children , handicapped people ,
B :  old people , and uh
B :  mm and prog basically they are programmable , specially for children . And uh
B :  mm yeah yeah . And then they also secure uh covers , to protect
B :  uh secure and hidden programming and battery covers that will protect your settings . So
B :  But we don't have to integrate all these complicated features . I'm just saying that the currently in the market there are there are control there are remote controllers f customisable for different people . Yeah , so that's the point .
B :  The next one .
B :  And uh you see this is the one where you have the protection cover .
B :  Mm maybe useful for children , they migh you you they only see the buttons outside . And for adults wh where you have more control you can see the one inside . So the adults might wanna have a key to lock that to pr so children will not touch the button inside .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  S a good idea .
B :  The next one . So this guy this is another company that provides big buttons . At I see that that is useful for old people and then you don't get it lost . But for our product we don't need a big one because you have voice recognition e eventually with use . And you can call your remote controller if you don't know where it is . T_V_ remote controller where are you ? And then , he will beeps and to say that I am here , for example . Is it possible ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  We should include speech synthesis in this case , no ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Uh ?
C :  Yeah but uh as Norman say if uh there is uh already a commercial product available who t who do this we we can check uh to integrate it i into our uh new remote control .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . And uh , this is another one where you can uh the the the part that's a V_ standing for the volume . So there's a up arrow and a down arrow . But you the see that in the V_ , the V_ appears to be the down arrow on the top on the top up arrow if you up arrow there's a V_ like as as if it's turning down so it's confusing interface , so I wanna avoid this kind of thing in the design .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah yeah .
B :  And here are is uh here is a s short summary that I summary that I compiled after the findings I found .
B :  Big buttons are convenient , voice recognition helps , push buttons , scroll buttons , spinning wheels can be used as navigation tools . And uh user customisable is important and finally simplicity simplicity is the key . Yeah . So we have many concepts there but we have to choose later on which ones are important to be used . And basically uh
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Well I I think you it's it's it's fine you have uh reviewed all all the possibilities but uh uh well uh i if we consider that uh the user interface is displayed on the T_V_ screen I don't think we nee uh we need much buttons in the remote since we we just have to navigate and to have a okay or enter key or things like that , because uh adding wheels or scrolls uh makes the thing more complicated and more expensive also , so .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
A :  Or maybe we can include the user manual in the in the remote control and we should have just a button like help and you say uh and you ik you press the button help and maybe you see the the user m might in the in the T_V_ .
C :  Yeah . That's a good idea . To have a help button .
B :  A help button . So you are display on the screen . So on the T_V_ screen .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  On T_V_ T_V_ screen . So just you push the button and we will
C :  On the T_V_ screen . On the T_V_ screen the uh how to use your remote .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay . Okay . So that eliminates all the complicated documentation , okay . So wi
D :  Oh .
A :  Yeah .
D :  But people are often enough looking at the help , once they see the help button they say oh this is a complicated stuff . It's a psychology . Okay . And let us see what the market demands . We could just go to my presentation .
A :  If the if
A :  No In the case where they need help , in the case where they need help .
C :  Uh yeah .
C :  In a marketing point of view .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  But uh wel well I think
A :  It's just for user customizable , for kids or old people . So
D :  Yeah that's right .
B :  Mm .
D :  I mean it just showed us the remote with an cap which could be used for kids and if you remove the
A :  So it's the same
D :  Same remote with some
A :  Can be used by both kids and old people .
D :  Both yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Well uh what I s propose is that uh you know a remote controller , i it could be a cube , is uh a small device that uh looks like a cube and maybe you can just change the um the buttons , if you ch turn one side you get one one buttons , you turn the other side you get the other buttons , so for maybe new generation people who get used to the computer they want lots of controls .
A :  Maybe for kids , kids they like uh t no l they like to
B :  Small
C :  Uh well . So le le let's see what uh what people want .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Let's see the market demand .
D :  And then we can decide what what we can yeah .
B :  What what market yes yes .
D :  we just made an marketing survey of what people need from our remotes and how it could be special from the other remotes . And we got the best on the responses from the questionnaires . Uh we also have some prizes for the most creative solutions . And we found the following solutions which we could which would be helpful for our design . So seventy percent of the users , they find their remote controls very ugly , they don't find it pleasant to use in the size or usage or anything . And eighty percent of the people they are always l I mean they are willing to spend more money
D :  if the remote control would look fancy .
D :  And the current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user .
D :  And seventy five percent of the users
D :  said they zap a lot . And fifty percent say they use only ten percent of the buttons , so the rest of the ninety percent of the buttons they're not used most of the times . So this were the findings which we found . And also they cited frustrations with the present remote controls . Most of fifty percent of the time the remote controls are lost somewhere in the room and people are always searching for them rather than watching the T_V_ . And by the time they found the remote control the program is finished . So they're frustrated a lot
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah . Yes .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And um if the remote control is too complicated it takes much time to learn the functionality of it .
B :  Mm .
C :  Mm , the functionalities yeah .
D :  So you can just see the percentage , fifty percent people they responded that they always lose their remotes and thirty four percent they say that it's quite difficult to learn if it's too complex . So keeping in view all these findings and the frustrations I think this should be the solution for them . We should have an L_C_D_ on the rem remote control .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Oh .
C :  Well mm w well I I I don't really see the advantage of having uh L_C_D_ on the on the remote control if we have a a a big screen and uh display on the screen .
B :  Big screen .
C :  It's yeah of course it's fancy trendy and so on but it's it's expensive to produce and it's not really
D :  Mm-hmm ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  I mean as our survey says that people are willing to pay more if their remotes are fancy . So if we have a L_C_D_ on the remote , rather than looking onto the T_V_ you just look into a remote and navigate it . It's the same menu as we have saw that iPod remote control . We just play around
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah .
B :  Mm . The thing
C :  Yeah but when you play with the iPod you don't have a big screen in front of you , s
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  You can use this screen instead of the big se screen , instead of use the yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . If you re-use the existing screen , we element eliminate the L_C_D_ , after all the L_C_D_ just to display and if you have the colourful screen you can make the display colourful , fancy , as fancy as the one on the L_C_D_ , maybe even better . So
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  I mean this were the points which we got from the market demands . So
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  So I th I I well I think we we can focus on the uh on the fancy look on the uh
D :  the other one
B :  Yeah . More on a fancy design .
D :  Yeah that's fine . Yeah . I mean that's
C :  on the speech recognition if the technology is available but well I think L_C_D_ will uh will uh make us spend a lot of money for not so big results .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Remember we have a s budget for the cost of producing the remote controller .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But
A :  Yeah .
D :  Uh yeah we have uh
B :  Yeah . So i is so the thing is you can find out how much an L_C_D_ will cost and then we'll decide again .
D :  I mean that should be found out by the Industrial Designers .
B :  Uh maybe you can find out the price and tell us next time . Is i if i
C :  So price of uh L_C_D_ display . And
B :  Yeah .
D :  And it's always good to have an voice recognition for the remote controls .
B :  Yeah . And also the cost for the speech recognition . Ask our R_ and D_ department .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm . It's for it's just for small vocabulary . We it's not yeah .
D :  Yeah it's o only for a limited vocabulary , say eighty commands or so .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . And ho
C :  Yeah okay . And
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . And also the scroller button , how much will it cost .
C :  Well uh compared to the to s the simpl simpler simplest button .
A :  Yeah . Push push .
D :  Mm , the scroll button , from the survey we never see that people would like to have some scrolling button . Because they they just they're just frightened to use the scrollings or help button .
C :  Yeah . Yeah I think that
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah I I I think that uh well uh as we have seen in the in the presentation uh well uh about uh uh fifty percent of the of the percent n choose the button so uh I think to have uh five uh simple button is sufficient for our functionality .
B :  Don't use the buttons .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It doesn't mean that the other buttons are not necessary or important .
B :  Important .
C :  Yeah . But
A :  But they are just less used compar yeah .
D :  They're not used much .
C :  But the uh the thing is is i is that we can add a functionality on the on the T_V_ screen like uh a a list of function and then you choose with the with the button to well you navigate and you
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Mm .
B :  Yeah , yeah . So so the at most more power uh .
A :  Or maybe we can u uh or maybe we can uh make this the ten percent of button more bigger than the others .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So .
C :  But if i i if we if we could have a a a display uh g a user interface that is very complete on the T_V_ screen I think that just five buttons are sufficient , one to go up left right down and uh enter and you you you just select the functionality you want to access or things like that . You don't have to to switch to a channel to another uh
B :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Mm . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Or it could be like this , as the people say , if they have a L_C_D_ on the remote not on the television . Because when you have the L_C_D_ onto the television screen you miss the picture in the background , we are most focused on the commands . So if you have then L_C_D_ in the remote , you just have a menu , and increasing and lower these signs here to change the programs and this menu when you press the menu , in the L_C_D_ displays as you go on pressing the menu it faster displays volume , then the program , then the brightness , contrast and all the stuff . And accordingly you can just increase or decrease .
C :  Yeah but
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah but if you look at the L_C_D_ you you don't look at the T_V_ screen so i i it's not really worth to get to have the image if you don't look at , so .
B :  Mm .
A :  It's
B :  Mm . I if Mm . Mm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And I think it's increases the cost of the the remote control if you use L_C_D_ . I
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah that has to be checked out .
B :  I think that there's no contradiction here , because if there are few buttons , you don't have to look at your your controller any more because you know where the buttons are , so if you wanna control the screen d sh sharpness you just say sharpness and then you t turn you just press lef increase or decrease button and the same for the volume and the channel , if you had the speech recognition there you just shout your channel , just tell your channel and then you don't even have to look at the butto at the controller so finally that wil eliminates the the need for L_C_D_ , with the help of speech recogniser you can Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  I mean , better if we could just check all the cost with L_C_D_ and also with the speech recognition . And then we could find which would would be a more suitable in this case .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Mm . Yeah . A and
D :  And the third problem was to find the remote control . Always , so fifty percent of the people say they lose the remotes . So
C :  Well so we we can think about a well a a vocal command like uh find and when the remote control uh hears fine well yeah just uh to make him beep or t
B :  Mm .
A :  You will listen to a peep , special peep .
B :  Where , yeah .
D :  Yeah that's right , that's exactly what I mean by voice commander . Or it could be also something like this , uh it's always boring to change the batteries of the remotes control , so we have some one charger there and whenever we don't use the remote control we put it in the charger . And when we're using that t remote and if we misplace somewhere , in the charger we have a small button , and just by pressing the button in the charger the uh remote control beeps , wherever it is .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Put it back at the charge . Yeah .
C :  Put
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  And that's a good idea , that's simple , like in phones .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  I mean it doe it also doesn't require a voice command , because there are problems with a voice command .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But you don't you don't have to move the the charger .
B :  Hmm . Mm . Th yeah . Mm yeah . Yeah . Mm .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . I mean charger would be fixed because it's always with electricity plugged .
A :  You have to keep it .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah if there if there uh there is nuff not enough battery .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm . There's mm . Mm .
C :  Also and uh uh the remote is lost .
B :  Yeah . That we can what we can do is we can program a function whereby when you press the switch off T_V_ button , the off button , the remote there be s uh instruction on the screen , please charge charge me . You never get it lost because uh every time you're off the computer the T_V_ you are asked the the command the T_V_ com remote controller would tell you to put it back to where to the charger .
D :  Yeah that's right .
C :  Yeah .
D :  It's an good reminder , yeah that's right .
B :  Yeah . So you will never get lost yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Maybe for some people lazy people .
B :  Yeah . Yeah because everything is programmed inside . So it's it's uh it's all about strategy , y
A :  Yeah yeah .
D :  And of course the final point is a fancy look . As we have seen earlier the
B :  Mm .
D :  remotes which were displayed by Norman they weren't fancy , I mean mm very big or something with lot of buttons . I think we should have something it
B :  Mm .
C :  They were ugly . They
B :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Well the last one with the um
B :  With uh two two two parts controller .
C :  yeah with the two parts was uh original , so
D :  I mean uh I mean uh I mean uh you see if it's like that even a kid who wants to have a control he could just plug it and use it , you can't avoid him . But you can have an button for child lock .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So just by pressing the button with some code , you t you put a lock onto the remote , so that he can't use even
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm . Mm .
C :  Well we can think about uh having uh on the on the on the user interface when you switch on the T_V_ you can uh well write a code or choose a category , if it is kids , uh things like that .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm uh
B :  Mm .
A :  Or
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah . Mm .
D :  That's right .
A :  Or maybe you have to to show some specific programmes for kids and then just just yeah just push uh kids button so it's automatically
B :  Mm .
B :  these are probl yeah .
B :  Mm . Mm .
B :  Mm .
A :  .
A :  So if he .
D :  I think these other four points they're the market demands and so it's for the user interface design and industrial design to just think
C :  So for mm yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So for my part I will check the prices the um the prices difference uh of what to use , where to use , and s uh and so on .
D :  Yeah I think it should be clearer for us in the next meeting that th uh these could be included .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . I think we need to define also a s the set of vocabularies for the speech recogniser
C :  Yeah .
B :  because uh if you want uh say we can sort by channels or sort by T_V_ programs , you have to decide a category of vocabularies for them . If numbers , they're easy , but if name the channel by by name
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well I think we can we can have just numbers for channels and you can say to your remote control like uh sports and then on the T_V_ you have a list with with uh uh well with sports program playing now and and uh
B :  Mm .
D :  No , we have a problem there . You see uh if you have a voice commands and you are s you are watching a score on uh basketball score or something , and if the score comes twenty four thirty five , you've just say twenty five and suddenly the screen the channel goes to twenty five . So I think there should be a prefix to some numbers
A :  Yeah it's yeah .
C :  That's right , yeah , yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Well but well e every possible word uh has a probability to come about of the T_V_ so .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I mean the the you just check all the probability that saying T_V_ twenty five and just ordinary twenty five . Ordinary twenty five you almost there's a probability of being said around sixty seventy percent and T_V_ twenty five
C :  Yeah yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah but well okay .
B :  Mm .
D :  I dunno it will be round about one or two percent . So it's better to have some prefix before the number .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
B :  But I I I think that the user would like wou would like to associate the channel or call the channel rather than than the numbers .
D :  Yeah something , some code .
B :  You say numbe channel number five of the T_V_ correspond to something else in the channel . So some people may want to say , I want to see this channel .
C :  Yeah yeah .
C :  Mm mm .
D :  That will be too big . And it will be difficult for the vocabulary also .
C :  Well I
A :  Or just
B :  Yeah . Check with the v R_ and D_ department the capability of recogniser . Uh ?
A :  It's difficult to to just say the the name of the channel . It will be difficult to say just the name of the channel . Because you have to s t uh a ch yeah but you have to to have all the name of the channel in your vocabulary .
B :  Well , it's convenient for the user .
D :  Als might be you just forgot the channel name , you kno only know the number . Then
A :  Or maybe
C :  Yeah .
B :  The uh uh mm .
A :  Or maybe the user can create his own vocabulary , just pronouncing the the name of channels and include in the vocabulary .
B :  Mm .
B :  I I think that I have mm mm I think there's another way you can do is that uh you can uh if when the user ch press a button to choose the channel for example , then what you can do is that the you can make the T_V_ screen to split them into small little little squares of images where you you you have a snapshot of every channel , so let's say it's a four by four matrix of the images , so now what you do is f looking at the all the sixteen channels available at one time , you just use the control button uh , you just you you just choose the the option you want and then you just hit the button and then you go to that channel . So
D :  Yeah , the .
A :  Or lets the user create his own vocabulary
B :  Mm .
B :  So you you don't use the speech recogniser in that way .
A :  of channel .
A :  No . Just you have uh in the beginning you have
A :  uh t you have to train you have to create the vocabulary by yourself . By associating each channel with the name or
B :  Oh , okay . Yeah .
C :  Well I uh I also
C :  I I also think about uh another problem , if if there is uh more than one person who is watching T_V_ the s well the the speech uh r recogniser should be able to distinguish between the two . Because uh I remember when I was a young child with my sister we yeah we always want to w to watch different emission at the at the same time so it's a pr it could be a problem if uh if well if someone passes by when you are watching T_V_ and say oh T_V_ thirty and just run , s
D :  Yeah yeah , .
A :  And for each one has his own .
B :  Mm .
A :  Or you have to s
B :  Yeah , I wanna watch this , I wanna watch that .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  A and in the same lines we would have a one more problem . If we are using the television in the different environments , say in the factories or in the shops where there is a lot of noise and this voice commands if they fail to work , that would bring a bad name bad uh reputation for our company . So I think we should specify some pre-requirements if we want to use a voice commands , say that it should be used in an silent homely environment or s something .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Or we can switch on or switch off the the special , yeah .
D :  Yeah that's right that should be an option .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah that's well I think that's a good uh a good option because it's simple and uh simple to implement also , so .
B :  Hmm .
D :  I think these are the practical problems .
D :  So we need to take care of them in the design .
A :  Maybe we'll discuss them in next meeting . It's time to close this meeting .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Well , you you stay a five minutes .
D :  Oh it came there on three minutes back so we are I think we can just press the okay .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Thanks for your collaborations .
C :  Okay .
C :  So I see ya .
D :  Okay . See you another thirty minutes .
A :  Uh welcome back after lunch , I hope uh you had a good lunch
A :  together .
A :  For uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the
A :  conceptual design meeting .
A :  Okay and the agenda will be
A :  the opening and uh that's uh the product manager or secretary that's me and uh the presentations from the Christine and uh
A :  Agnes and from Mister Ed .
A :  And finally in this meeting we have to decide
A :  and we are to take a decision on the remote control
A :  concept and uh the functional design
A :  So we have forty minutes , I think it's uh
A :  little bit uh low , but I I hope we can finish it up so I'll handle to the
A :  the functional team , to the Christine , okay , to discuss about uh the components concept .
C :  Okay . So uh , if you could open the PowerPoint presentation . I'm number two .
A :  You're number two .
C :  Components design , there we go .
C :  So uh can we put it in slide show mode ? Yeah .
A :  The next one .
C :  Right here , is that little that one , yes please . Thank you . I'll take the mouse .
C :  So uh
C :  we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components , uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . In instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , you have to have microphone well no you don't actually I haven't have to have microphone in the device , but um maybe you do have it a a way it has to it has to hear the speaker and um , so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , but somewhere you have to put the microphone , um and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . Um so the other w thing that we So . Our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials and we contacted manufacturing for their input because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , so uh this is the approach that we took during our um our research .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . Course , you know , I wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore , so then we were thinking about um rubber , but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's
C :  uh goes with the board .
C :  Uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while , so um we still had titanium and and wood available , but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh , the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , although how Apple did it with th PowerBook I'm not su quite sure but uh nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood .
B :  At least it's environmentally friendly .
C :  So , this is our finding . And a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material , so we're we're currently uh proposing , uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . So then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , but uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . And um then there was the regular which I regret that I've forgotten exactly why I'm eliminating that one . Uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , and uh we liked th we we found that it it includes this infrared sender , which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip .
C :  And uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , so uh we we uh now jumping right to our personal preferences um I I'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . I think that people will might really want to design their own cases , you see , they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet , and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , and then I uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . So this is the findings of our research and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . Do you have any problems with that ?
A :  Can you go back uh one slide ?
C :  I'm not sure , how do I Oh , I know , let's see . Let's go back up here .
B :  Thank you . Yeah .
A :  Yes , uh question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? What's the meaning of that ?
C :  I think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh I could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting .
A :  Yeah , is it means it's on the yeah is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh
C :  I don't know , but I'll find out more at our next meeting .
A :  Okay , tha that would be great , so if you find out from the technology background , okay , so that would be good .
C :  Sounds good .
B :  Why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ?
C :  Because um it gets brittle ,
C :  cracks
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  We want we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years .
C :  So . Good ex Good expression .
B :  Whic
D :  Wow , good expression . Well after us .
B :  Which
C :  I don't know , speak for yourself , I'm planning to be around for a while .
B :  Although I think
B :  I think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , wouldn't you , I mean it chips , it if you drop it , uh it's I'm not su
C : 
A :  So so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes .
D :  Actually , I'm ready to sell it . I'm ready to sell it .
C :  you're what ?
B :  I think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , but you can't just use
C :  You think ?
C :  And you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it .
D :  No y no no no , the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , but there are some very pretty woods out there .
B :  Yeah , exactly , yeah .
C :  Well I'm glad you
D :  That's actually very innovative idea .
C :  Okay , good . Sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face .
D :  Well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  The stain .
D :  I mean it's each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh , what about yo you ?
B :  Um , in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own
A :  Yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first
D :  In turns of wow .
C :  She works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this . Luckily Ed was not .
B :  Y yeah .
D : 
D :  Wood ?
B :  I think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation . One thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh Yeah , for example . So , have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , but
C :  Mm-hmm . Yeah , you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your
C :  It's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething .
D :  They do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , so , and chew 'em up .
C :  Yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah .
D :  And chew 'em up .
A :  Okay then , uh , let's move to Agnes .
B :  Sure .
C :  Oh , I'm sorry .
A :  S you're
A :  You are in participant three .
B :  One point three , yeah .
B :  Uh , yeah .
A :  This one ?
B :  I think so , yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's the one . So , it's a very short presentation , 'cause I'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , um , which basically shows , sort of I took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , which I completely agree with Christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . And actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control .
C :  Right , my hand is uh different size than yours for example .
B :  So , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . Um , one thing I thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a T_V_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . And also um you had issues with the batteries running out , so I thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . And in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . So , in terms of what this thing would actually look like
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Despite working in interface design , I'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me .
B :  You'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your T_V_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . And then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops ,
B :  channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . And then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish
B :  number pad .
B :  And then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your T_V_ and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . So that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um , so again you can have a little L_C_D_ light somewhere , the flip
B :  thing and Have I forgotten anything ?
B :  I don't think so . So , as you can see , it's a very very simple design , which is one of the things I really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . Think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different .
D :  No .
C :  A hinge .
C :  Be like a copper hinge or you know .
B :  Yeah . But you also have to d start watching out for the weight , 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . But that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . As you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
D :  Hmm .
B :  So , that's pretty much all I had to say , I mean , everything else in terms of design issues . Um the centering of the key pad and
B :  the channel is just depending on where your thumb is and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , but more or less I think it should go along those lines .
A :  So what's your , uh , the comments or uh
D :  Simple design .
D :  It's what consumers want .
D :  It's almost like , Houston , we have a product here . Problem is obviously gonna be cost .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay , I also have a f very simple presentation , because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I also have uh copied a
D :  different type of remote .
D :  If you can find me , where I'm at .
D :  There should only be one in here . trend watch .
C :  Sure .
D :  It's being modified . They're stealing our product .
D :  We've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , 'cause uh trends change very very quickly . In six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . Uh they already erased the rest of mine , huh .
C :  No , f go to findings .
B :  No , no .
D :  No no , no no .
D :  'Cause I had another comment there . Uh the market trend . This is what we know from the last uh from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we've done , fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . Looking for next generation of innovation , because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , we have to have something completely different . Okay ? Easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that uh , with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use .
D :  And I think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . So even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . The second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . The second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use . The first one , I see that they put in a display .
D :  Now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . Maybe the display also makes it easier to use , because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the T_V_ or the D_V_D_ or something else is in .
B :  Right .
D :  Okay
D :  Because I've seen mostly the standard ones , yeah . Now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . The idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing . So maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use ,
B :  Especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  trendy , fancy , feels good ,
D :  uh with a display ,
D :  wood , designer wood , designer colours , we might've
C :  You know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand .
B :  Oh yeah .
B :  Yeah , so it's really molded to to your specific
C :  To t an and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  How hard they squeeze ? Resistance resistance , right .
C :  Yes you'd know what kind of wood to get .
B :  But th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote .
C :  That's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that .
C :  Oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect , yeah .
B :  The sales , yeah .
A :  The
A :  Yeah .
A :  I hope so .
D :  No , but incorporating the three uh obviously it'd be something totally new on the market , totally different and from
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick .
D :  Although , what it was it uh it was uh Nokia that came out with this changeable colours . Right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face and then they sold millions , millions .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Right , mm .
B :  And that took off , yeah , yeah .
D :  So . So say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new . We have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  We'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , we might wanna um learn about um labour laws .
C :  You know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries . So actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , but we can get a production in , uh , countries like , uh , India yes , yes , countries like India or China or Malaysia , so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more .
C :  Cost of living is low .
A :  So
C :  Good , well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more and to where Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , yeah , so
D :  Where w Where it would be manufactured is is
B :  Mm yeah .
A :  Yes .
A :  So
D :  another step . We're here to design ,
A :  Yeah , so
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yes uh , but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay . So we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something , so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more .
D :  come up with a nice product .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So , but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , if is acceptable for both of you , what uh Ed was talking .
A :  And your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I think it depends , I mean I think it's a good idea , but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be because theoretically with the T_V_ you already have a big display right in front of you .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
B :  So , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display
C :  Hmm .
B :  is a way to go . I mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for very specifically what it would be used for , 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's
C :  Hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , but
B :  that's just sort of speculation , I mean .
C :  What do you think Ed ? Do you he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , um , do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ?
D :  No . No no p spec It's 'cause we have to find out cost on it .
C :  Do you wanna take an action item to go find out ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Sorry about that .
D :  Um , no that's no problem . I'm here for the pushing it after it's made . I will market it . Once we get a price on it then we can market it .
A :  Yes .
C :  So the the advanced chip on print is what um what we've
C :  we've deci we've determined and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , and um I think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  A customisable and
D :  Nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case .
B :  What about the buttons , would
B :  Would the buttons be wood too , or
C :  Uh I don't think so , no , I think they could be rubber like they are now , so you have that tactile experience of
A :  I don't think so .
A :  Yes .
A :  Yes .
A :  Don't looks nice uh .
A :  Yeah , so uh what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being until uh th Ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . Okay . So maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . Okay ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Sure .
C :  So um are we done with this meeting ?
A :  Yeah , I hope , if is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design , okay . Then they can show you how it looks like , and then we can uh submit to the I will submit to the management . Okay ?
A :  Then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display . An and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay .
C :  And a marketing strategy .
D :  And marketing strategy , thank you . Fired .
A :  Yes .
A :  How much you can
A :  how mu how much how much you can sell extra .
A :  Of course you'll make money too , so it
A :  it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission .
A :  Okay , so , any questions ?
B :  No .
A :  So , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , then uh , then we can proceed from there .
B :  Okay . Mm-hmm .
A :  It's okay ? So thanks for all your uh efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then . Okay ? Thank you .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Hello everyone .
C :  Hi .
D :  Hi .
B :  Hi .
A :  Um how uh how we doing ?
C :  Yeah , good .
A :  Uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . Um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , meaning gathering i suggestions
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given .
A :  Uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use .
A :  Um it's also an item that people lose a lot . So we should address that . And , of course , it should be something
A :  s s that is very simple to use .
A :  In addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another
A :  so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact , 'cause um if they say , well , I go home and think about it , that won't work .
A :  Um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve .
A :  And maybe it could be sold by using a slogan .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip
A :  that has infra-red bits and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip .
A :  Therefore , messages uh will be controlled in the same manner . There should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . If too many buttons are pressed ,
A :  mm uh uh child lock um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um
A :  you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . Also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes .
A :  So the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , and maybe some kind of a holder
A :  uh for the for the uh item .
A :  Francino who is our um interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it , of course , should have an on-off button , and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock .
B :  Interface designer .
A :  Particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable . It should be compact . Her personal favourite was it should be T-shaped . And maybe have an anar alarm-clock . And the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature .
A :  Uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves .
A :  Uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature .
D : 
A :  And even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote .
B :  Yes .
A :  Uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
D :  Yeah , I think that pretty much is it . Yeah . Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , then we I'm looking for three presentations . And uh I don't know whether the order matters much uh , I don't I don't think so , so whoever w wants Yeah , okay .
B :  Okay , I can start first .
B :  Okay .
B :  Now my slide , please .
A :  Okay , your slides . Okay .
A :  Oh , come on , close already .
A :  And that's number two , right ?
B :  Three .
A :  Three .
B :  Participant three .
B :  Yes .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Now as an interface designer , I would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers .
B :  Next , please .
B :  Okay . Now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . This messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine .
A :  Nine what ? Nine channel uh switches ?
B :  Pardon me ?
A :  Nine channel switches ? Is Yeah . Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes , nine numbers .
B :  And then you have swapping of uh button by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Then it should have a next button , and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one . Next slide , please .
C :  Going to the nex next .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . For example , if you are watching a French program and you would like to have a subtitles in English , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the the subtitles on the screen .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture .
B :  Now there should be a memory switch .
B :  There should be a mute button . Suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh T_V_ , but he he can reduce the sound , he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the T_V_ . Now the most important feature I would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature .
B :  It's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit .
B :  So a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , for example , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , uh th now the the uh yeah , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . So the T_V_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . So this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
B :  So this is one one of the interface which can be created .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  A very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features .
B :  Then , please , next slide .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
B :  Then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . So uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . So you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly . Even a kid can use that . So can you go on t t uh to the next slide .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . And this has multi-purpose use , it can be used for T_V_ , it can be used for cable-satellite , it can be used for V_C_R_ , D_V_D_s and audio .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And this has in-built voice recogniser .
B :  Can you go on to the next slide ? Yeah , now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use . Uh this is user-friendly , it's very attractive and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it . And this comes with different colours , different shapes .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons and all the important uh buttons are there in this small , compact ,
B :  attractive child interface .
B :  Next slide , please . Now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace . this .
D :  You don't know me . I could lose that in a minute .
B :  So this is No this is a very big , you cannot misplace it anywhere . So this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  This i this is one such interface which can be created .
B :  And the personal preference uh would be a spe uh uh to incorporate speech recognisers uh which will respond to user's voice for a particular uh function .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right .
B :  Thank you , that's
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , thank you very much . Uh any comments on uh her presentation ?
D :  Well , um looks like we still have quite a choice of things out there . Um what uh I'm No suggestion's bad . But uh we're gonna have to narrow it down a little more . I don't think that we can get uh The T-shape is good , the child one is good , the too big to misplace , I think it's just funny . Um I don't think that's gonna be our impulse purchase at the checkout counter . It's it's gonna be a little bit too unwieldy .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm yes .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , I I th I think
B :  Okay .
A :  No , I think the these are her presentations , but uh as far as the decision making we getting to that after after but if I just wanted to know whether anybody had any any anything to add to her presentation .
D :  Yeah mm . Mm-hmm .
D :  Have to come back to that later . Okay .
B :  We can .
D :  No , I think her presentation was good , and she really explored all the options . Yeah .
A :  Mm right .
A :  Mm-hmm . Ho who wants to go next um ?
C :  Yeah , maybe .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay , and you
C :  Participant two .
A :  Uh okay .
C :  Uh the next one , sorry . It's it was the old one .
A :  Oops .
C :  Components .
A :  The components design . Mm-hmm . Okay .
C :  Um this time I'm I'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . Uh , can you go on to the next slide , please .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction . Uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera , it's like
C :  Uh it can be a plastic one , hard plastic , so that it can be strong , even if you just uh uh , you know , if you if it falls down , then it doesn't break . So it should be strong . And uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that . And it should be recyclable .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh and uh , yeah , and also uh using of colouring compon components like uh if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components .
D :  Mm-hmm . Good point .
C :  And uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit . Uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . If it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . And it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures . Suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures . And uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility .
C :  And the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through through through the uh remote controller and uh also a capacitor which is a b which is a m I think it's it's like a battery , capacitor . Can you go on to the next slide , please ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh a diode , a transistor , a resonator , these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . A battery uh , I would like to suggest one thing uh if we
C :  uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much . It it it's not a high voltage battery . Then also we can If it is a rechargeable one , then uh people can use it for a long time , so in that way we can cut cut the cost , but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller . Can you go to the next slide , please . And how it works , how the remote controller works . When you press a button
A :  Go away .
C :  Thank you . Uh when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . Suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed . It pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button .
C :  Every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . Suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button , and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . Like you have got a signal by pressing a button . That's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit .
C :  Now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . That is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . It will amplify the signal and it will send it to the L_E_D_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . The sensor on the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do . Then it will do the appropriate action . So uh this is how the remote controller works .
B :  It works .
C :  Can you go to the next slide , please .
C :  Yeah , I have few pictures . When you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's it this is a normal remote controller . And to the next slide , please .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And where we had a a few buttons and all . And uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , and also a capac uh a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator uh um mm yeah , and di and a diode transistor .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  The electronic components uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d diode transistors an
C :  Yeah , di um can y uh you can see the T_A_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm yes .
D :  Yes .
C :  Uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors , and uh just beside that you can see a transistor , and a uh uh cylinder shape , uh that one is a capacitor . Uh and also there are uh um resistors uh sorry , ther there is a diode . Can you go go on to the next slide .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
C :  So uh this is the circuit board . The green one is a circuit board . Actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive . Uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper , because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing , because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like uh , you know , you don't need to use wires and all . It's not exactly wires we are using . It's just printing something on a board . Tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So th that green uh thing is a circuit board , and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons , like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated uh th it will it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , yeah , um integrated circuit . Can you go to the next slide , please .
B :  Transmit .
C :  Uh so this is these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . Uh can you see the black uh , round marks ? They they are the circuits .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yes .
C :  Next , please . And um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . Uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . Like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip . Uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy , more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . So that also we can have in a battery , uh or we can use solar sells . Uh .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Hmm , that's interesting .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases . Uh usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller . Um .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay . And you have more pictures . Uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , maybe d uh I have just one more slide , I think . Um .
C :  Like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , but titanium we can't use . Um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print , um also infra it includes the infrared se sender . Um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker .
C :  An Yeah , that's it .
C :  It's all for me now , thank you .
A :  Okay , well thank you .
A :  Any particular comments by anybody ?
D :  Uh yeah , on the scroll and the push-button , um ca you can achieve scrolling by repeatedly pushing a button ?
C :  No , no , no , th the the the scrolling wheels are different , like you can go for a sw switches like buttons or scrolls , uh which which we used to do before ten ten years before , I think . Now , nobody uses that because you need you need a a k sophisticated chip and all . So I think it's better we go for uh um ordinary buttons . Yeah uh yeah , push-buttons . Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um .
D :  We'll just go for push buttons for in the interest of cost . Okay .
B :  Push-buttons .
A :  We don't have a lot of time left and we will still have to make a decision , and the marketing expert has to present her her thing .
D :  Okay . Go right to my first my next slide .
A :  Uh okay .
D :  Um alright , my method is uh I'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , so I've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . I s I spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . And then when I'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , I try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , and if it's convenient in the conversation I ask about it . And I would encourage you all to do the same . Um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . Um people like something that really fits in their hand . Simple is beautiful . They don't want to have to squint at small print um , they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , and they don't care for the mode thing . They want each button to do something . And eye-catching is important . It's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . Go ahead , I'm trying to finish fast for you . Um and our preference is , as far as I'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . Ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their Christmas item . And we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . If we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . So we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , I think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . And I've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular . And in my research this year I found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . And people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . They are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . So those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item .
B :  'Kay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . Uh that
A :  concludes the presentation of everyone . And what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And uh so what do we think on the concept
A :  of the remote ?
D :  You wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ?
B :  Uh yes , I would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser .
A :  Y
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ?
C :  Yeah , but w
B :  This could be uh one feature which could be sellable .
D :  Yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature . That that be really good , yeah , I agree with that .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I think that's
C :  Yeah , but but I what I'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work , because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Distance problem ?
C :  Yeah , it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice , like maybe different people will be having different voices , so it like it's uh everything so i
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh .
A :  Well , you you teach You have to teach uh
C :  So to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , I think .
B :  No , it's it's , uh yeah , it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th For example , you have a T_V_ system , I'm the user and my family members are the user , I will already record uh a question like , uh good morning , like around eight o'clock I want to see the news in the television . So I'll say just good morning and the T_V_ will switch on . It will recognise my voice and will switch on .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , but Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , before we get too far off here um , the components of the concept is the energy . What kind of energy do we foresee ?
D :  I think I think battery , and I think we all agreed on that . That that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing .
A :  Battery . Battery .
B :  Battery .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Okay then chip on print .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yep .
B :  Yes .
A :  Okay . And the case . And I think we all agree on the case , we wanna have something uh maybe bright , colourful .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong .
B :  And compact .
C :  And also strong .
C :  Trendy , yeah .
B :  Trendy design and compact .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Trendy design , compact and strong .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yes .
A :  User interface concept , uh interface type , supplements .
A :  That will be your area I think , right , Jana .
C :  Uh .
C :  Um like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface .
B :  Push-buttons .
A :  Put uh k I guess uh for yeah .
C :  Push-buttons .
A :  And
A :  Not sure what they mean by supplements .
B :  And
C :  Yeah .
D :  Well , I think that
B :  Supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button .
D :  Yeah , or or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement . Her speech recognition feature would be a supplement .
A :  Oh , like
A :  Oh .
A :  A what ? Right , right , right , mm-hmm .
B :  Recogniser . Yes .
C :  Mm yeah .
D :  Okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
A :  Right .
B :  Yes .
A :  Okay . Uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , and the uh I_D_ is to this is the individual actions to be taken until then , to have the look and feel design ,
A :  and uh the U_I_D_ is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design ,
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . In this phase , the two of you , Jana and Francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . You will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um if you have any questions , you know , you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach , I suppose .
D :  Wherever they're hiding ?
A :  Um so um I think we conclude the meeting here and we come back in uh uh thirty minutes , according to our timetable here .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  Thank you very much .
C :  Thank you .
B :  Thank you .
A :  'S to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , so in that sense so it does kind of make sense , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , sure . It kinda does make sense , doesn't it , because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background . Everything I have is kinda background .
B :  Okay , well
A :  Yep .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay we all ready to go ? Well how um on the in this meeting then if we um
A :  Yep .
B :  I'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . And we uh decided on
A :  Yep .
B :  decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um . And I told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the T_V_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um so that was the last meeting . Is there anything have I forgotten anything ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  No .
D :  Uh that sounds .
B :  Is that everything ? Okay . Um so if we have the three presentations , and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . That might be a better idea this time . And so if we start off uh with Andrew and then Craig and then David , if that's alright . Um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right . So if you wanna take this .
D :  Sure .
D :  Okay .
D :  Sure .
A :  Yep .
D :  Yeah , cool .
D :  Why don't I get that ?
D :  Hmm .
B :  Screwed in quite tightly .
B :  Uh what did uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? We did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ? Right . Oh I should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product . So um that's kind of the end result hopefully .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Um alright so c is it function F_ eight ?
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Hopefully appear in a wee second .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Come on . I think it's working .
B :  Up there we go .
D :  Okay great s so let me just start this .
D :  Okay great . So um uh s move on .
D :  Uh-huh oh where'd it all go ? It's not good . Okay lemme just see where I can find it .
B :  Oh no .
D :  This looks more like it .
D :  I think I just opened up the template . Sorry about that . Okay alright so let's have a look here . Okay so this was the method that um I've taken . Uh basically what I wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is I want to show you all the background information I have that I think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful .
B :  Oh right .
B :  Here we go .
D :  And uh and then sorta g go through some of the way that I've dealt with that information , and then sort of bring us all together into it to see sorta see how this fits in with the overall vision .
B :  Okay .
D :  Um so I've tried to take a whole lot of market research and summarise it for us , and then ide identify uh trends that are are sort of in sync and are important to our our uh p project plan that we have so far , and then uh initiate a kind of discussion on design options so that it sorta helps us to to narrow in on on aspects that will inform other uh other elements of the of the project .
D :  Does that make sense , tha that sort of strategy ? I thought that that will impact on the rest of what we do , so that's why I suggested we get in this . Okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep .
B :  Aye a fair point definitely .
B :  Okay .
D :  Um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , I think , creative about it . Number two was that it be innovative . Okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . Uh and third priority uh for ease of use , so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um quite user friendly while still having technology .
D :  So it I'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , is that I think um what we should think about is how the um
D :  about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . For example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what I mean , like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative because obviously the thing that the message here is ease of use . So how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? Well that's I guess where we're gonna go with this . Okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um
B :  Aye right .
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Okay .
D :  research I have here is on fashion style , okay , which as we've agreed is a priority . Uh top European fashion trend um that I read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , especially in clothes and furniture . And when I first saw that I thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , or we get right into it , or we completely steer away from it , do you know what I mean ?
B :  Okay okay .
D :  So my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . Um 'cause I think what we're in what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , um so I think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , I think that would be pushing it .
D :  And then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . So um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , so if we try and really capitalise on that , I think that'll be in our favour . Um
D :  So these this is the summary of everything . Um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . Uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . That was like the number three thing . And then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um
D :  that's the way I interpreted it anyway , softness in materials , shape , and function , and so I've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , Mac iPods , something which is , I'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons . You know what a Mac iPod is ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm that's true , yeah .
D :  I'm thinking however Mac iPod is sort of last year's because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , so I'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a Mac iPod and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of or more of like a
D :  maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have .
D :  Um and then so this is w with all that information what I'm what I'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things , that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . Sort of like a
D :  I dunno like um we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , that we agree on , uh sorta like a marketing identity . Um
D :  Does that make sense ? Yeah . So so like I threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , I dunno , green colours , pe whatever , it's just an idea , 'cause I'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that .
B :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Like um the ones the ones which I'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . Like I see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and
B :  Great .
B :  Okay .
D :  So anyway it's just just an idea .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . Like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up . How can we build on that ? Maybe like it could light up in different colours or something or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like
B :  Ah .
D :  covers or something so . Anyway those are that's all I have , but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into
B :  Okay .
B :  That's great .
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Okay great . Um thank you for that . Uh Craig do you wanna
D :  Yep .
B :  uh plug yours in then ?
C :  Is it working ?
B :  Mm .
B :  Not quite .
D :  Did you press F_ eight ?
A :  It's probably not sending .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh something coming now , yeah .
A :  Yep , there it is .
B :  There we go .
C :  And so think of this concept .
C :  Um to research it I've um had a look on the the homepage again . It's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . Um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , um so I've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um
C :  So then this we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , um the shape of the control , and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control .
B :  Mm .
C :  Um what I found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them .
C :  Um they're not very attractive to look at , and they're not very comfortable to hold , they're I just hold 'em like big bricks , and they're very easily lost . Um they tend to be very dark colours , so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . Um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red , uh it really should be . It's uh something the user then uh identify with . This is a red switch off , that's how it should be . Um I'm not sure if there's any other examples of that , but something to look out for .
C :  Um there's a problem that I've I've got couple of preferences for the the end control um I get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by and s the other examples of that um
C :  The buttons should be large . They shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . They should be easy to press , very comfortable .
C :  Um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a V_ on them , so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . Um should avoid s things like that . Um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
C :  Um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea .
D :  Yeah . Okay , do we have a corporate colour scheme ? I didn't know .
B :  I think it's yellow because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow , so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there , but keep going and we'll discuss it after .
D :  Okay .
A :  And the Play-Doh 's yellow .
D :  Okay .
C :  Fantastic .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
C :  any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , they shouldn't be on the um shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort . Um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , possibly hidden in the the opened up section um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um we should definitely avoid the big square block look . That's just wrong .
B :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And um we got an email uh from I think it's the the research department , and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question . So it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take
B :  Mm .
B :  Aye that's a good idea , yeah .
C :  and possibility .
C :  Right and these are problems I've had with it . Um I don't know where the slogan should go , or really what the slogan is . I think it's um , fashion into electronics . And we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is . I mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours , but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
C :  That's it .
A :  Cool .
B :  Okay .
D :  Great . Lots of good information there .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah that that was very good , and uh now with David .
A :  Mm 'kay um .
C :  I think I'm cool .
D :  It's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table , huh ? Just um
B :  I know it'd be handy , wouldn't it .
A :  Oops .
B :  Do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um
A :  Yeah okay . Let me just get this going first .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Ah there it is .
B : 
D :  It takes a second , doesn't it ?
A :  'Kay , that should be it .
A :  Okay um I guess the same thing again , I started with something very basic . So just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , um and then you can just work through it and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um the components are exactly the same . Um I think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . The rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . Um like you said time to market was a problem , um and how many components are physically in there in cost .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And the power is basically a factor of that . Um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , um and that would have some inte impact on how y I think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control because um like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide .
A :  So um you know it's just a matter of working out space . So I guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . These are the three things that um will have an impact on you . So just go through it in the components . Um these are the options that are available to you , um I'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause I got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Right .
A :  Um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . I it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . So maybe if you well I could see the other email that they sent you , um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa
D :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Okay so your basic components are buttons , okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , okay there's an L_C_D_ display , um I think these are quite standard things .
C :  Right .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  They're standard , aren't they ?
A :  No um they're well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . I'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later . Okay um then there's um how the case actually looks . It can actually be flat or it can be curved , um and then the different types of materials that you can use , um I don't think you can use them in a combination ,
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  um but um I could check back for you , but I don't think you can actually use them in a combination .
B :  We you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ?
A :  Um I think plastic and rubber would be fine , but plastic , rubber , and wood , I wasn't I'm not very sure about the titanium . They had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . Um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , so I think that there is some restriction on um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Mm 'kay .
B :  Okay .
A :  I think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . You know as opposed to two . Um and the other components are logic chips , um again I'll I'll go back to the component chips . The com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
A :  um and that impacts cost . Um I don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . Power consumption should be about the same . Um I think the main impact is complexity , um and the other thing is um the power options . Um the first one is a standard battery . Okay the second one I think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , it's a wind-up you know , a crank . Yeah but that that might be something I think that's more of a look and feel decision because I don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Hmm .
B :  I'll clear one of these things for you .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Just by moving it yeah .
A :  I think whatever it is you still need a battery 'cause I don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . Okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , which may not be a great idea in Europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead .
B :  Mm .
D :  No .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So like what I said , you probably need like a battery and something else . Um and the kinetic one I guess for me is the most interesting one because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their and it's a nice sales gimmick I think . From a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing , it's a shake it it doesn't work , shake it , knock it or something . You know you know you have you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Hmm .
B :  W yeah . Uh yeah yeah , I see .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
A :  You know just to if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , kind of you know just uh you know um so . Um okay my from my role , I don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , I think um something comfortable to hold , um small and slim I guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
B :  I know what you mean yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um and the other thing is from a production point of view um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . Um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so . Um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . Um
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  The user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the L_C_D_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . Um the case okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels . Okay with the titanium case , let me just check that um , titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square .
B :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay um there's no restriction on the plastic , and it can't be curved on the wood . So that's again , I don't think you can use them in a combination , um especially the titanium I I suspect they're very fixed to a particular need . So um mixing them may not be a good idea um yep . That's it .
D :  It can't be curved . Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Right .
B :  Okay .
B :  Right can I
D :  Uh question on can I ask a question ?
B :  Yeah well yeah it's just I'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so but yeah you c ask away .
D :  Okay .
D :  Can we uh power a light in this ? Can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ?
A :  Um I think we could because the L_C_D_ panel requires power , and the L_C_D_ is a form of a light so that
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
D :  So maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery .
B :  Why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of ?
D :  Well
D :  I mean I'm thinking it might be
D :  That for uh this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it and that's gonna take battery power , and to make that to make that a realistic goal I think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ?
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light , or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know Frankenstein , it's alive .
D :  Illuminate the buttons . Yeah it glows .
D :  Well m I'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a D_V_D_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , and that's what everybody does . Oh where's the volume button in the dark , and uh y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Like a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone . Okay cool .
A :  Okay .
D :  Like a phone , yeah yeah .
D :  Whereas with phones , people charge them once a week . We're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Um that's why I think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch
D :  But are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ?
B :  Mm .
A :  um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . So you could trigger that to a light , like I said the bouncing ball thing , or you could trigger that to use that to power the light as opposed to so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the
D :  Right .
D :  Sure .
B :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Right .
B :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right okay um well let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . So um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product .
A :  glowingness .
D :  Okay , great .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  So back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . Um I mean what does everybody think about
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ? I mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing , what are your thoughts on that ?
C :  Um I think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . Um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit .
B :  So maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or
C :  Um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand .
B :  So something quite curvy ? Okay um right okay . Colour-wise I mean you made a re uh was it you or uh I can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it , was that
A :  I think he made that .
B :  Whose about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . Um and when the corporate colour is yellow , I mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow I don't know . Um
D :  What's that ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  And then obviously the uh the materials when it has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ?
B :  That's all .
D :  Well I mean I'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts , and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um the look and feel . So for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour , you said company colour yellow . I mean if we think of something , like I was saying also lime and lemon you know , what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . We just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
D :  shapes and things .
B :  Right .
A :  Is there a particular shape that you're interested in ? Like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? Does it need with a square thing wha
B :  Oh you know like in circular in shape or
A :  Yeah 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of
D :  Yeah .
B :  Choice of material yeah . 'Cause I I I was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch . It feels a bit more comfortable , and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber
A :  Like fruit . I'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky .
C :  See I'm
D :  Yeah .
B :  into it . And then then we could have curved shapes , 'cause wood or titanium , yeah , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular and I think we might be moving away from that you know so um
B :  Well I'm do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or no I don't think we do either .
D :  No no no not at all . It's more more just that we we think about like
D :  what it is we're trying to achieve , so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . Do you know what I mean ?
B :  Okay right well um so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing .
C :  I'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape .
B :  A snowman shape ?
C :  Um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need .
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  That's quite a distinctive shape , that would be good wouldn't it .
D :  Right , sure .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah so yeah should we go with that ?
D :  Um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a
B :  Do you wanna draw it on the board ?
D :  Can you like yeah just t we can visualize it .
C :  Um something like that um you got two groups there um maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside or uh you have volume controls about there .
B :  Ooh that'd be good .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yep .
B :  So call it the snowman-shape trademark .
B :  Yeah that's cool . Um and I mean colour-wise what does everybody think ? I think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . I mean do you want the whole thing yellow , maybe like yellow and white do you want something
D :  Mm .
C :  So I reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here , had a sorta background yellow , and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons .
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Okay cool . Um and also I mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? The fact that it talks to you , I mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , I dunno . Or when you like or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . I d I d any thoughts on that at all ?
C :  I think that might scare me .
C :  I think that'd probably scare me . You turn it on your control possessed s .
B :  I know . Um unless an a I mean if you also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an L_C_D_ display , where would we put that ? Would we put that on the inside or
C :  Um
A :  Do we need an L_C_D_ display ? What what's the functionality of that ?
B :  It's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , I would've thought .
A :  Yeah but the question is what are we using it what would we what would we achieve from it ? Putting in lights is cheap but putting in an L_C_D_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a
D :  What would it achieve ?
D :  Well
D :  L_C_ well I'd when you used to mention the L_C_D_ I'd think I wonder what that would be about . And the th the thing I could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings . So as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , so um it's a bit nuts to get the Monday Tuesday Wednesday you know .
D :  Right , okay .
B :  Mm oh yeah that's true .
B :  Yeah .
B :  So so no need for an L_C_D_ display ?
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
A :  Um I I'm not saying there's no need for an L_C_D_ display , but um it's what's what what would it tell the user , 'cause the L_C_D_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? We have the option of the speaker as well the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ?
B :  I think that would make it very complex .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm not real
B :  I don't know if there is really , no um
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Nah .
A :  Um
B :  I would say no need for a talk-back . Uh does anybody disagree with that ?
A :  You could put a game on it . When the T_V_ dies you can play with the remote control .
D :  No .
B :  No ? Easy .
D :  Mm mm .
B :  Okay um right so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , um I mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , is that what you're thinking ?
C :  Um well I think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . B um I think the we had were fairly basic ones , they'd have to go on the the front somewhere .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay right um what else do you need to talk about ?
D :  Well i I was just
A :  Where would you physically position the buttons ? Um I think that that has some impact on on on many things . Um maybe you wanna draw onto the
D :  Yeah .
C :  Um
D :  Yeah .
B :  So I'm just gonna um pop this in here 'cause I have a slide about decision making which I'd forgotten about .
A :  Yep .
B :  Oh sh God we've got five minutes um okay uh back we go . Um energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? I really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , I mean what does anybody think about that ?
D :  Yeah , sure .
D :  Um I've had kinetic things before , and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , and watches yeah
A :  No , like I said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just
D :  Sure , okay , right , okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Support for it . I mean just it's just worth pointing out because like I've I've known I've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because I don't wear it all the time . Like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , I dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down . So we should think about
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well I suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either . So you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea I'm really sorry we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , we don't have as much time as I thought . Um so I think that's what energy is referring to here . Chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it David ? Okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yep .
A :  Yes yes .
D :  And this size here , I'd suggest this be small , like quite small .
B :  Yeah I know we're gonna have like rubber buttons that feel kind of
C :  Yeah I think so yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Um just a a lot of the um
D :  I mean one of the things running through my mind right now , I realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . Should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly uh um theme like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals ? Like
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm 'kay .
B :  Could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that .
D :  Okay so so backlighting , that would be good .
A :  Or even a clear case . Um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , but in the dark it sort of , it's alive . Um in in a slight subtle way .
D :  Yeah clear , that'd be
B :  Aye that would be a good idea .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah sure .
B :  S so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . Is that what you mean ?
D :  Yeah that'd be really good .
A :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . You know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right . So the power the battery in that sense , maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights that sort of
D :  Sure .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Sure .
D :  Yeah they they emanate a light through it .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky .
B :  Lights .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Yeah , mm-hmm . Um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , and so I'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled , 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do . Could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? Or
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
A :  The question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? Do you want 'em to roll it like that ? 'Cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm . Well why don't we do it like a mouse then ?
B :  Yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ? If you're holding it in your hand you could
A :  That's a very unnatural motion to yeah . Can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . Um it might work for volume , and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , but not for channels right . If you have a Telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , you've about fifty channels , can you imagine trying to . Um and I don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the I dunno .
B :  Do you think ? Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah okay okay um
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , sure .
D :  Mm .
C :  Well , but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button , the number part .
B :  Yeah .
A :  But users tend to tend to want to use that and once they lose out on the user experience they're like
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
C :  Uh but
A :  Because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of
B :  Okay .
D :  But that's not a bad thing is it ? Because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button . Jog dials are much easier than that .
B :  Just
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay um right well wouldn't it we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly . Um I'm all for them actually , I think they're quite you know th very quick to m to use . So does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? No . And the other thing was um can we think of any way of getting the slogan into this thing ?
D :  You just roll .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah like I mean if we if if we keep coming back to this board here , I wouldn't be surprised if we could take this idea , imagine that , I dunno , that it's within the shape of the hand , it's quite small
B :  Uh-huh .
B :  Uh-huh ooh okay , we really gotta wrap up so yeah .
D :  I dunno .
D :  Yeah .
D :  It's small , and that we've got like the the l slogan somewhere like on the casing at the side ,
B :  Okay well if we can do that , great . Yeah okay .
D :  and that yeah well I mean isn't that what we just h said said we s just have to decide now ?
B :  Yeah let's let's try and get the slogan on there um , and
D :  Yeah . And then like a jo
A :  So you wanna expand the shape of the
D :  And then like a jog dial somewhere that fits in with the shape of it like I dunno like here , in with the
A :  That that might have one problem in terms of um in terms of whether you're left handed or you're right handed you might be locking yourself in . Could I just could I just jump in and suggest something quickly ?
D :  It would get bumped , it's doesn't really fit with your hand . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Or maybe just fit it in like down the middle here .
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
B :  Right I'm gonna have to I'm really gonna have to hurry you on here 'cause we're we're actually over time . Um is there anything anybody's unsure about ? Just for in closing just the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes , and so you can see in the screen here what each of you are gonna hopefully be doing , uh I know that the designers are gonna be working with Play-doh on that .
D :  A jog di
D :  Yeah . It's kind of yeah
D :  Yeah .
B :  So um that'll be that'll be good . Um and I'll get the the minutes up as soon as possible . Anything at all you think we haven't discussed that we need to ? Is everybody kind of happy about what they're gonna be doing ?
D :  Huh .
D :  Um
A :  Um I think one thing would be the jog dial 'cause that's gonna have quite a big impact on the thing um
D :  Yeah I think the jog dial , you know it just after you drew that , what if it was flat and you just spun it , that'd be great .
A :  Yeah that's what I was thinking the a slide , because then you you don't have to put the hand . I think incorporating a logo is quite straight forward . There's lots of space for it um
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yep .
B :  Okay .
B :  That's kind of a design thing that you guys can can discuss , yeah .
A :  Yeah but it's also a a marketing and a function
D :  Sure , yeah , yeah and materials we sorta said we'd do plastic and rubber , didn't we , and I think maybe we should try and stay away from just the big protruding rubber buttons , 'cause that'd just be so standard .
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  To make something flush with the case ?
D :  Something a bit more flush , yeah , or maybe have rubber incorporated into the case as well , so that it has and also t plastic I've seen can get really textured , so you can get plastics that actually feel soft in your hand .
B :  Okay right .
B :  Okay .
B :  Sp kinda grippy ?
A :  Feel like fruit . Fruits kids .
B :  Okay .
D :  They feel kind of like um , you get pens now and then that you'd think that they were rubber but they're not , they're actually just plastic that's textured , kind of a little bit like
A :  No like
A :  Yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah yeah kinda like that yeah .
B :  Okay I'm gonna have to I'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time . So um that's really good , like we've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so . So off you go and design stuff wooh .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Play-doh time .
B :  Yeah quite jealous actually .
A :  You got to choose first . No , we're kidding .
A :  Okay , can I just swipe your power cable , I don't think it matters .
A :  Okay lemme okay , I'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left .
A :  It's you .
A :  Argh . This is a real hassle and a oops .
A :  I'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's too lazy t take them off again .
A :  Cool .
B :  Alright , yeah . crack on . Okay so we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes . I think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out . Those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick ,
B :  L_C_D_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being I suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . Um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , the idea to try and separate us and also because of the minimal design
B :  um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . Um that pretty much sums up the last one . So we'll just crack on , um like to maybe start with the Industrial Designer if it's possible . Um uh the con today is the concep today . This uh meeting is the conceptual design phase and is um
D :  Uh uh okay . I'll just
B :  Sorry about this . . And is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of , um , can we uh outsource these from elsewhere , um will we have to construct any items ourselves ?
D :  Uh I have a presentation I just saved it in the uh the folder .
B :  Yeah , okay well I'll just uh I'll load it up then . Um .
B :  Which one do y
D :  Uh .
B :  Oh , interface concept ? That's you . We've got trend watching , that's you .
A :  Yeah , that's me .
C :  Uh .
D :  It's uh
D :  Components design .
B :  Components design .
D :  .
B :  Okay .
D :  Alright . So
D :  Uh .
D :  The case uh le that's what I wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . Uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood . So uh we decide what it's gonna be . Probably plastic . Uh
D :  we need the infra-red transmitter . Get that off the shelf . Uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be
D :  plastic w or rubber even as well . Um
D :  if you go on to the next slide . Uh
D :  If you go on to f uh findings , it's like two or three slides down .
B :  Okay .
D :  Right . So , this is what I found we can use . Uh
D :  three different types of batteries . Um
D :  can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one .
B :  Okay .
B :  Now , the kinetic one , we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it . Um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query . Is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ?
D :  Um .
C :  Cost is
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Do you think ?
D :  Uh .
A :  There's also a watch moves around a great deal more .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I don't think it would . Um .
D :  And solar cells , I dunno about that .
C :  yeah .
D :  Uh .
D :  We should probably just use conventional batteries .
D :  Um ,
D :  just like in usual remote controls .
B :  Which I suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again , you'd say ?
D :  Um .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Um .
D :  And these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have . Uh one is a flat one , and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . Um the materials are tha there as you can see , but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved , uh which would be
C :  Titanium , the really strong metal , titanium ? Is it not also it's expensive ?
D :  Yeah , and light .
D :  Uh , i think so as well , yeah . They make mountain bikes out of that , don't they . So it's really light as well .
B :  Um . Um .
B :  Curious . Um , I don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not , the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ? Um could you maybe draw something ? I you don't doesn't have to be perfect , it's just 'cause I'm not quite sure if I understand the difference between the two .
D :  Um .
D :  T yeah .
D :  Uh .
D :  for a curved , well I was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand . Uh maybe like this , with the uh joy pad here . Joystick here . And maybe
D :  an okay button around here , so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily . Um I don't exactly
D :  Double curved . It probably means this is probably double curved . Uh whereas a single curved would be
D :  like that .
D :  I guess .
D :  Or not necessarily .
B :  So it might literally just be okay .
C :  Two curves .
D :  Yeah like that . Whereas this is two curves . Um
D :  so I guess that's what they mean by uh double curve . Um which obviously it looks better than the single curve , but uh you can't have it in titanium , which is
B :  Alright .
D :  a nice material .
D :  Uh
B :  Mm .
D :  and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel which they use in mouses for com P_C_s . Uh but
D :  um it requires a
D :  more expensive chip to use , and if you wanna use L_C_D_ it's even more expensive . So you have to decide , there's trade-offs there . Um
D :  if you want the buttons to be oh yeah , if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . But you're gonna ha I reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . You wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . You wanna enter just the number of it , if you know it . So
D :  um I reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway .
D :  Do you think ?
B :  Okay , that was definitely something we can talk about . Um so you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  So ,
D :  depends where
D :  gonna spend the money
D :  if you want the f fancy L_C_D_ display .
B :  Um , do you have any idea so far , like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an L_C_D_ , does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? Or ?
C :  Need an advanced chip for the L_C_D_ . Is that did I
B :  Well I think compared to say just pressing buttons .
D :  Yep .
C :  Advanced , like three eight six advance .
B :  if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red , whereas I think if we're controlling the L_C_D_ we definitely require a much more powerful chip . Just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons I think is the the point being made . If I've not over-stepped . Yeah ? Okay , um should I go on , or go back ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay , sure .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah i
D :  Um
C :  Mm , if we only have twelve Pounds fifty ,
C :  twelve Euros , not even twelve Pounds . Twelve Euros , what's that , like eight pounds or something like that , nine Pounds ?
B :  Well we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in producement and such . I assume . We have to look into the costs of those . So , sorry .
C :  Okay , that's good point .
D :  Uh the previous slides just explain what's in the internal components of the uh remote control . If you go to the one before that uh so it just says what it does , translate the key press into an infra-red signal and this is received by the T_V_ . Uh the chip just needs to detect the signal or detect the key press and then uh it'll send it to the tr the amplifier .
B :  Okay .
D :  And uh then the next slide just shows how the uh copper wires
D :  uh interact with the buttons , the rubber buttons , uh
D :  to uh get sent to the chip .
D :  So that's just how the control works inside .
D :  Um we have to decide on what
D :  buttons we're gonna use .
D :  .
B :  Okay . Um .
B :  .
B :  So in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an L_C_D_ looks ?
D :  Um
D :  I think we can do it if uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . Um and then
D :  maybe use single curved uh case .
D :  Because we might need it to be curved for the uh
D :  thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . Um
D :  and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the L_C_D_ .
B :  Um I mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me . Um conventional battery would seem to make sense . Um I'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved and I'm I don't know about anybody else , but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ? .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Um I'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons I'll go into uh in more detail .
B :  Okay .
C :  I also have a preference for rubber .
B :  Okay , well um
C :  Based on my research .
B :  Yeah , well will we move on to user interface , and yeah ? Um sorry , as long as were you ? Yeah . Okay . Um and d d d interface concept .
A :  .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yep I'm finished .
A :  Yep . Now I'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  and the white board 'cause I actually I have some fairly concrete things
A :  this time . Uh um I was given a
A :  an H_T_M_L_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs , and pretty much decided to just dump them all . I wasn't very impressed by them and they didn't seem to re uh nothing I saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . Um so what I ra rather than looking at other remotes , uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand .
A :  Um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , um so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . Um so uh next slide , if you please . Um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the L_C_D_ , just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum .
A :  I don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad because if you m because one of the menus that we could have available um v via via the L_C_D_ is one where you scroll through channels , so if there's something f and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um
C :  digital .
D :  Ah , okay .
A :  f f f for di for digital or um or for or for cable , whatever , you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then um your V_C_ uh and then the channel through your V_C_R_ and or D_V_D_ player . And or um box . So it's not I'm not really excessively concerned about that .
A :  You must have two two modes , basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right left right for channels , up down for volume , um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions . Um now the reason I was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . Um , so you
B :  Can I just jump in slightly there ? That would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yes , absolutely . Um , basi basically what I basically what the what be having um , I would say , the the whole thing articulated at two points , so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it so that the um the L_C_ the L_C_D_ and the uh
B :  okay .
A :  The joystick would be in the right place .
B :  Mm .
A :  And also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it that it should be , you know , soft to touch and
A :  can be moved around all nice . Um okay on to on to the next uh to the next slide .
B :  Okay . Um , yeah .
B :  Just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well , because I think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say , I guess .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , 'kay basically um
A :  I can add pretty pictures to this . The um
A :  Assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position , um hol uh holding the remote , the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . Um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users . So .
A :  You then have a grip section that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . You just have big two big buttons that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger . Um , and that
C :  Is this the joystick ?
A :  Th this part here is the joystick . This would be the actual grip . Probably where you'd want to have the battery as well . That would be probably the bulkiest part . And you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the L_C_D_ , and this would need to be articulated as well . And basically I'd want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist . So it would fit just nicely in the hand . And again , this part could be
C :  Okay .
A :  rotated , so it can
A :  So so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user . Um
A :  So the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch and menu mode would be the enter button . And then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . Um now programming it actually thi this is one thing I've found with um the replacement remote control . Programming them can be a right pain . So I thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um
A :  a cable to connect it to the computer some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer just so that you could um pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface . And you could download programs for it from uh for uh T_V_s from all sort of main manufacturers . Um though you i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet . Um . But uh . Yeah .
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
A :  That's that's my idea .
B :  Excellent , right . Um uh . File open .
C :  Mm .
C :  'Kay .
C :  We go .
B :  Trend watching .
C :  Okay .
C :  So uh to gather my research , two basic methods . We compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . And then we we research uh fashion trends in Europe , what's what's the new black , you know , as it goes . Next slide please .
B :  Okay .
C :  Uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . As in they want it to do a lot of good s they want it to look like it does a lot , and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , but they don't care so much , you know . They want it to be that's sounds a bit like a contradiction .
C :  Technology technical technologically innovative . People want it to be that , but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . So like the interface is really important . And easy to use , it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important I mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . People want it
C :  I is it has to be cooler than easy to use , you know , if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features . And if it's easy to use that's a bonus . The fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes .
C :  How that relates to a remote control I don't know . But I I see I come on to that in the next in the next slide . Spongy . I've als I've been saying everything's the new black . Well spongy's the new black as well . So we have the choice between rubber and plastic . If it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then can I skip the rest ?
D :  Oh yeah , I forgot to mention that . The uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber . Forgot to say that .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay , so kinda spongy material . So um so my personal opinion ?
B :  Okay .
C :  Um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . But what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future that looks cool , that's that's different , you know , that's everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , you need something cool . Like , titanium is cool but it's expensive . And maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control .
C :  Um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction or we stay totally away from it . Um I mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , so maybe it is important for it's the up to the interface guy . So if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . It could be something like ,
C :  I say potato peeler but I'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than I do . So I think cool is the key . Few questions about a spongy remote control . I've never seen one before . I've seen plastic remote controls . I think maybe they were
C :  I don't know , back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  sturdy , you know . For being strong and sturdy . So um if we want something strong and sturdy , I say stay with plastic or titanium , but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , it doesn't matter , it's spongy material , it's not gonna break , you know . I just don't know how the L_E_D_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . So how do things fit it ?
C :  And if we are gonna use spongy , we can say it's long lasting , you know it's damage resistant and stuff like that , so . So just to summarise , people want stuff that's cool , that's that looks like it's cool , and if it is cool then that's a bonus doesn't have to be um people like fruit and veg . We can either go down that alley or stay totally away from it . People like spongy material . If we're gonna use spongy material we have to think of how practical it is , and how we can further promote that idea . And also , this was this year .
C :  So , things change all the time , every year you know they they always talk about this year , this is the new black . Well next year something else is gonna be the new black and we're stuck with last year's fruit and veg type stuff . 'Kay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
C :  That's me .
B :  Well , um I would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway . You always have to bring out new designs , so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway . Um .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf , so I don't exactly what cost would be incurred . Um I can see your point about the number keypad , but I've I would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels . My feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um boxes as well um having the use of the L_C_D_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers for you to be
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , actually if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , becau it's you know if you're trying to remember what uh , you know , what number's the discovery channel or whatever . It's just irritating . But if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub-group them .
C :  That's a good point . You can incorporate names into the menu .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay . Even news , music . Like they do on uh sky digital kinda . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  So you
A :  Yeah .
B :  So what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , um ,
B :  say something like um lithium ion battery , the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . Um
B :  Looks like we going for a double curved design . Um I don't know what cost implications there are in that . Um , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . Though I'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame .
A :  Yeah , I I would say definitely , I mean I mean I mean the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th there would be basically two points of articulation . W um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip .
B :  Do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? I can see why it looks appealing , but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ? That would be a worry of mine .
A :  So
A :  Mm .
D :  If you're going with the fruit and veg thing , looks like a banana .
A :  I d I don't thi I don't think that it would be a a structural weakness , I mean if you have a firm s sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . If you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know
D :  F if you wanna design it that way .
C :  .
A :  organic , and I think would look rather co I mean mi rather cool . I mean my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice , it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control , but uh .
B :  Yeah , we won't add that functionality .
C :  Okay . Course not .
B :  However , one interesting point is , I don't know how serious you were there , but we if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  Sure , yeah .
B :  I dunno . It's an certainly a different colour from your average um
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Make it harder to lose , as well .
D :  Yeah .
B :  That's true . Was there anything in your research
C :  Sure .
C :  The noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep . Y you know , you lose the monkey the banana ,
D :  monkey .
C :  y you lose the banana , you press a button , and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana .
A :  I th uh I mean if it I think that's something that could perhaps be programmable , though maybe have monkey as default . Um .
C :  S oh , I was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . Now I think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all T_V_s , you know you s you click a button and it finds the frequency that
C :  works with your particular television . But why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature , I I don't know .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well basi basically the um for f for uh I mean e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the T_V_ responds to . It's not simply a matter of frequency . So um
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote , and you'll have this little booklet of codes you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer and try the different codes that
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  come under that manufacturer's name 'til you find the right one . It's
C :  That's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it . Okay .
A :  Yeah , that's right . So that's that's quite annoying and we probably would still have to do that . But if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that
A :  rather irritating thing .
B :  An interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the L_C_D_ and then they maybe look up different names of um different actual units that have been produced . Or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Is it is it actually a book of names to digits , or is it like a few pages ?
A :  Um booklet . Some pages .
C :  I was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping .
C :  This person probably need to use this feature like once , you know , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television , so once every s
A :  Yeah .
B :  Doesn't have to be used very often that's right , yeah .
C :  Yeah , and it's
A :  Yeah . But it's a but it's a nuisance . And it's a nuisance very close to the to um to actually purchasing it , so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about . If you if there's w i if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it . Um mm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay , this just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage . I'm pretty sure that you got that anyway . This is the conceptual one . Um .
C :  Mm .
B :  I think we've come up I think we've covered everything we need to here . Um I think we've decided on what , you know , decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such , so we're now looking at the detailed design and what we need to be doing for the next meeting . Um
B :  So for example , um I'll just start at the top , you've got yourself and the Industrial Designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage 'cause it'll be hard not to , obviously . Um
B :  looking from prototyping of some des description using clay . Um I suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh progress . Um
B :  The user interface design ,
B :  They're kind of it looks they're the idea I've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there , whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the L_C_D_'s going to incorporate , do you think ? Or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ?
A :  Mm .
A :  Um well I I think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it , um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made , I would say . Um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . So um and one of the nice things about having an L_C_D_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it .
B :  Mm-hmm , that's very true .
B :  Um .
B :  Okay . Um got product evaluation as well . Um .
C :  Yeah , you see I don't some of these things kinda logically follow the others . How can t product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen
C :  a product prototype .
B :  I I think we'd be yeah , no , it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with .
C :  Oh , that's the okay , sure sure sure .
B :  Um so it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places which I suppose is quite similar . Or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control , what do you think of the look of it ? Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay , sure .
C :  At this stage we still have no no target audience or
B :  I think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous . Um the reason I'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control , something that's stylish , so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying
C :  'Kay .
C :  And it's stylish .
B :  if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then , they've got a bit of free cash , so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket . Maybe even single , just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
B :  Although of course I mean at twenty five Euros , I don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device . Think that's well within the normal bracket . Um your idea of the U_S_B_ would I think would largely depend on the cost . U_S_B_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , but it might push the cost of the overall unit up 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . That one might have to be based on
C :  Yep . Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Programmable memory as well .
D :  The U_S_B_ for which ?
C :  For the remote control .
B :  The the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the P_C_ for a larger programming due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice , easy minimal design , normally .
D :  Oh right , okay .
C :  We've w definitely talking some type of
B :  Um .
D :  But didn't they just say it's just for T_V_ , or are we gonna
B :  It's just for T_V_ , but for
C :  Different .
B :  programming it to use your T_V_ , you might hook it up to the P_C_ . I I'm not sure , but I'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the U_S_B_ might be prohibitive . We don't know unless it would make sense to .
D :  Okay , yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , I mean it's
C :  But you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something . Well something that doesn't you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , you know , once you turn off the power .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . The other thing I mean it I mean it would need to ha it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway . Um f for one for one thing because I do think that the menu system should be um uh I mean although you know , it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device , the menu system ought to be um
C :  Yeah .
A :  o ought to be customisable and uh
C :  Different languages , uh different skins and stuff like that .
B :  Mm-hmm . W
A :  Mm-hmm . How uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels . That sort of thing .
C :  Sure . I if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff , that does open it is supposed to be international , right ? So .
B :  It would make sense to . I would say to . Um and we'd better be careful about the time as well . We've already had the five minute warning , so . Um . I would say yeah .
C :  It would make sense if you could
C :  Okay .
B :  International would make sense . Um you're gonna look at product evaluation . I'm I'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . Um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say . Um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay . Uh we'll see how that goes . Um .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Are we going to be supplied with the clay is what I want to know . Where is the clay ?
B :  So um do I think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , would you say ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  The fruit and veg .
C :  This one .
B :  Yeah , I would s that would be my my feeling .
A :  Mm .
A :  I th I think I would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing .
A :  Bu but um but the spongy idea I like . I like it a lot .
B :  We seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I having it i having it sort of br bright yellow I think that's quite a good idea , though maybe we could have options for colours as well .
C :  Yeah .
A :  and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose .
C :  Sure . I mean we are trying to promote a remote control , but we wanna keep the company brand as well , so .
B :  Yeah . So we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Possibly I'm think I'm not sure but I'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . Um .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah . I was like like I said before I I think we should have the R_R_ on the uh on the top function button .
B :  Okay . And I think that says it all really . Right . See everybody in a half hour .
C :  I think so too .
B :  I'll wait until you're all um hooked up .
D :  Oh good grief .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Okay .
D :  Oh .
B :  Put it on in that way . Thanks .
A :  Oops .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
B :  Welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun .
A :  After lunch .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Right um this is our conceptual design meeting , um I think we're slightly ahead of ourselves
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  from the last meeting , I th I I think yeah um .
C :  Yeah , yeah I was getting that impression as well .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  This is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching .
C :  Etcetera .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So I think we've touched on a few things
B :  to do with that already , but we'll just go over it .
B :  the minutes from the last time . Um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . Um
B :  we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , we've decided on there being a flip design and um a different shape from what's normal . We were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , just a different shape from what's normal , um .
B :  You were going to look into the rechargeable batteries
C :  Yeah .
B :  and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , things like that , um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range . Okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ? Yes if you feel
C :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Shall I ? Okay . We just connect up .
A :  Yep .
D :  Thank you .
D :  There we go . Okay um so we decided on our market and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . Um
D :  the methods we used to decide on uh
D :  current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects and the the general feedback from them is that the most im uh w I'm sorry I'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , sorry Project Manager . Um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device and we'll come to that later . So that was one of the first things we did . Also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in Paris and Milan .
B :  It's okay .
D :  Uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . They also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative ,
D :  and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . Now I should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use .
D :  So possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . Okay , um , now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , um we found from our um consultants in Paris and Milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . So should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  There also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , uh again in contrast to last year . So a lot of interesting feedback there , both from our market research departments and from our people in Paris and Milan . Be interesting to see what our design people make of that .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Okay thank you very much . Um
A :  Yep .
B :  let's start from the inside and work our way out .
A :  Fine . It's okay with me .
C :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Unless anyone has any questions about that ? Not yet ? 'Kay .
B :  I don't think so , not yet .
B :  Um , yes , thank you .
D :  Okay .
C :  That screwed in ?
B :  I hate those little things
C :  Yeah .
B :  especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them .
D :  I know .
C :  'Kay ,
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay . Um this is uh all about the design of the actual components and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . Okay , first uh the
C :  Into the method . The the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the T_V_ and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . Um also in this study I've looked into the availability of some of the materials , 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available .
B :  'Kay .
B :  .
C :  Um , findings , I've got my nice little picture there . This is uh the chip called the T_A_ double one eight three five which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input and um it's pretty much used for all all T_V_ remotes at the moment . Um and then we we're loo looking into battery options .
B :  'Kay .
C :  There's um actually no rechargeable option available , so we I saw the um the standard double A_ and triple A_ which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , dynamo charging , I thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , people won't it's it's basically like wind-up radio . So you wind up your remote control before you use it . It might
B :  Wa can you explain that ?
B :  Like a right , okay .
B :  How what kind of how l long can you get out of that , I mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? Or
C :  You
C :  Yeah , yeah , oh yeah I presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , but I don't I don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , like the the solar charging , 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got T_V_ .
B :  That doesn't count though does it ?
D :  Does does light charge as as sunlight does ? Artificial light ?
B :  I thought it was U_V_ like
C :  No .
C :  Is it ? Alright i
D :  Has to be solar .
B :  Any , any
A :  Yep . Regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light because we we have to take into consideration size also , so maybe a standard triple A_ might take lesser space or and dynamo might take more space .
C :  Yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up .
B :  I'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun .
C :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Mm .
B :  Uh , I don't think it counts electric lights no , but I mean not many you don't want to limit your market . I mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people .
D :  Artificial light , no .
D :  That's going to
D :  I know , different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally .
A :  Uh
C :  But
C :  Yeah and most people most people also watch T_V_ in the in the night anyway .
A :  Right .
A :  Night .
B :  Mm , but then it would be charging through the day , I think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening .
C :  But I I think I think the the next one's the best anyway . The the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches and you d you don't even notice it . I mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , I don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah I've seen
A :  And are these like uh what are the life of the kinetic battery , it like it runs for long time ?
C :  Um yeah it's it charges into um some form of it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches . And that'll that would l would last for um well I do I d I'm not entirely sure how long it would last but I've never seen one run out .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  But then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time so you're walking around , you're doing things , it is moving a lot of the time . If you'd I mean you switch the T_V_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . Is it really gonna be enough ?
A :  We c
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah and
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah but then again I I think it is because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um it's always moving for the whole day and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side . And th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it and you put it no no I do I don't think the the draw on it would be
B :  Okay .
D :  Hmm . Mm-hmm . Mm . Could I just ask referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ? I mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging or the two things not compatible ?
B :  So it's not the draw on it isn't
B :  Okay .
C :  Mm .
C :  Ye yeah I think I th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case and they because , if you lie on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical .
B :  Like a dual kind of .
D :  Mm .
D :  So that affects the exterior design .
A :  Solar would be slightly expensives .
B :  Expensive as well . What kind of price are we looking at for I presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ?
C :  They're they're expensive , they don't
A :  It's twelve point f
C :  Yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest I'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , um but the
C :  It's i I think they're not very resistant to dropping , 'cause if you drop stuff yeah if you if you have y the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big but I mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so .
B :  Solar .
B :  Well they're not designed
C :  Y I think yeah , practically .
B :  Practical-wise okay .
C :  I mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot whereas remotes you do , they can t
B :  You do get a bit of wear but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ?
C :  Yeah they do , they yeah they've got dual things , but they're the batteries are smaller I think .
D :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
D :  Again it de
A :  Another question is like sorry . W w which one would last the longest , because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day .
C :  Mm . W m yeah so the
A :  A remote control , like , so we have to s look at the life also .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah the the s if you if you had something du uh using the standard
C :  batteries and the solar charging , um , I don't think you'd I think the it would d well you know how long the standard double A_s would last in or triple A_s would last .
D :  It would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , i it's not gonna add anything , okay .
C :  Yeah I think i I think it would , yeah .
B :  Okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Can we think about that ? 'Cause if we're doing the kinetic thing and it's
C :  Yeah .
D :  Shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in because I I personally right , okay .
B :  Well add it in to think about um
B :  because ,
B :  where am I ? If it is the kinetic thing and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of we're doing something original and different um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than
C :  Yeah .
B :  the eternal battle for control of the controls .
D :  It's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , it's not a thing that people are looking for
B :  No .
B :  Okay .
D :  when we threw it open to the field yeah .
A :  So
D :  But it's something to put on the side to think about maybe .
C :  Okay .
B :  Okay , right .
C :  Okay , well I'll move on .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um , my second part of my findings uh the mo most current remotes use this silicone uh P_C_B_ board which pr printed circuit board , which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code and then it's fired out of this L_E_D_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts .
B :  What kind of things do we have to consider there ? Can we what kind of size , does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of
C :  well this the thi the thing about is um
C :  they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be because you can you can print circuit board like that that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . If you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , if you if you wanted to but um the there is an option to do to do it like that , or you could have some sort of
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
C :  array of switches which I'll speak about in the next bit so that
B :  Okay .
C :  And then to uh yeah , so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . Now what I was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a T_V_ remote , but you could you could have lights behind the buttons and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used I'd have that turned off , if we decided to go for buttons that could light up .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  Um , the case material , I've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , the there's the plastic which I think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing and
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  the the main problems with the well you could go for wood but I think it would be a bit impractical . Titanium um very expensive just to process , which to make it is expensive , and rubber , well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , but I was thinking more of the buttons , because the buttons which they've they've said
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
C :  that they've they've put across
C :  are what is used in some stress ball manufacture and it's meant to be anti R_S_I_ . I'm no I'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances but that's what they said . Um the problem with the casing is that uh there's
D :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . If you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes . But whether whether or not because we'd have it in two separate units
C :  for the flip phone .
A :  Second thing is yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , you call it a skin or whatever . So in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . So is that feature available in like uh titanium , or it's like only specific to plastic or
B :  Hinged , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah I th
C :  Uh .
C :  Yeah in in titanium I don't I don't think it would be available at all really , the ju just it w well you could make it available in the titanium , it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is it's light and strong but I think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  It does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . I've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . I was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , that would give the spongy feel , that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone .
C :  for a remote .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Rubber , yeah .
C :  And you can peel them off yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off .
D :  Like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Something like
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . That could be a good idea .
D :  Mm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  It could it would be comfortable to hold on also .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm .
D :  Very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well that's been really popular with mobile phones so I don't see why not .
D :  Mm . Yeah .
C :  Also the just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , the I kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen . Now what I was saying before about instead of having you could have just a bare P_C_B_ circuit board and I'm sure you could probably get it in different colours and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection
B :  'Kay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  over if you had them close enough , that would be one option . Um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , but I thought that an L_C_D_ type of screen 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch
A :  Sorry I didn't get the last part , you're talking of
C :  display .
C :  Uh what what
A :  Just what you said I I didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like
C :  Oh on the on the L_C_D_ screen you could becau you could fit it the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it , but um you can you wouldn't have with the L_C_D_ you'd have the wires coming off , you wouldn't have that with the
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  with the L_C_D_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board .
D :  Mm .
C :  With
C :  W also with the
D :  I don't s sorry to interrupt , I don't see why the curved thing is a problem , if we for example had a shell , once we open that yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Oh it would be flat inside .
C :  You could have a flat screen inside , yeah , but I'm just wondering whether we want an L_C_D_ screen inside . It wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , but there'd be touch touch buttons , so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-R_S_I_ .
B :  Mm .
D :  Have I misunderstood you ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . Now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , I mean
C :  Is rubber .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah I hadn't I hadn't really thought of that to be honest .
B :  Uh
D :  I just had another idea , I don't know if it helps with that , but just to do with the R_S_I_ . Is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . Mm .
C :  Yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out but I I think they could get a bit easily lost , 'cause I had
B :  Like one of the palm pop thing .
D :  Yeah . They're easy to replace as well , cheap .
A :  Absolutely , f for somebody who very often , if he would a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever .
B :  It would have to be attached .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah okay .
D :  Yeah just a thought they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , couldn't they ? A pencil or a pen , so they wouldn't really need a
B :  Okay , we'll talk about that so if you finish your and we'll come back to that . That's you , right okay .
C :  Yeah that's yeah that that's the end of m my
A :  And just one small question before like you are , regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , I mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , it kind of applies to both our designers here , so I'm not sure how it would fit in . If we flip open , now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , you seen those ?
C :  Mm .
B :  No .
D :  And they kind of respond to the turn of your body . Is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing .
B :  We're marketing to guys as much as we are to women .
C :  Um .
D :  They don't look at themselves ?
D :  Just a thought .
B :  Well it's a remote control , you were sitting watching T_V_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit I should go and have a shower and do my hair before I put the T_
D :  Yeah .
D :  I know what you mean , it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones I kinda got sidetracked onto that I think , okay . trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much but maybe we'll leave that one on the side .
B :  Yeah , no , no .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Okay .
C :  I mean you can you could do it , you could have a 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an L_C_D_ display it'll completely blank it out , but I don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , I'm not sure about
D :  Mm .
D :  Oh I think forget about the mirror that was just a very quick passing thought yeah .
B :  Okay , okay .
A :  Okay , uh
A :  would like to share something which I did here . First thing is uh basically on design we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . Second is we checked into competitors , the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . So y you generally see there's not much of variety and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . So you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . No particular remote is standard .
B :  Mm .
A :  Like , some some people have a
A :  Here you see this ? This is on a I I
A :  I found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized and they are not consistent th with other models and all .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay , and second as already discussed with William , we are going to have m maybe a G_ G_U_I_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top and g graphic user interface basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , which is
C :  Yeah .
D :  Sorry what does that stand for ?
B :  Which means
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  If you if yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Like you have on a l uh icons or something y you have is a good example of G_U_I_ graphic user interface .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  So basically not point or click
A :  Press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . And on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , that means the use of button . So he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So we are having a combination of boards , so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels .
B :  Can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ?
B :  'Cause if you're thinking about holding it
B :  you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone .
C :  Yeah .
D :  No you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be
D :  Wouldn't you ? Isn't that the idea ? You us if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your L_C_D_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li
B :  That's what I was just saying , and then have the and then have the L_C_D_ at the top and then be able to touch that for the other controls , so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that , on the lower side . Okay .
A :  But
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay and you mean to the
A :  And the lower distance . Oh f perfect .
D :  Hmm .
A :  So the findings are too many cluttered buttons .
A :  Repetition of certain but buttons which I already explained , example the volume and channel control buttons . All are confusing and in inconsistent . Okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , there was a mail
A :  which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . We have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , but for like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . So it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers I am here . Some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also ? And technologically innovative also .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this .
A :  My personal preferences would be like , as already uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit so I wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  tomato red or whatever and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh
C :  Well , yeah we
A :  I think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , so we we we would not change h that particular pattern because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I can't see that , is that play and stop and things ?
A :  This is central one , the one you yeah volume and channel . So keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , if you look at all the models , it's here .
B :  Or is that volume and channel ?
A :  voice recognition .
B :  Okay .
B :  Right . Okay . Um
B :  I'm not sure how long we've got left , but we need to make a decision about um
B :  the things we've discussed .
B :  So , we agree on
B :  Do we agree on the battery ?
D :  Kinetic ?
A :  The kinetic .
B :  Yeah . Um , that means that there's no function for li the port , you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . It's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah I think I mean if
C :  Yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them , uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . So do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , I'm here thing ? I think that would be quite fun .
B :  selling point .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  I think the only
B :  I think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , but I think pretty much we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things . The L_C_D_'s not cheap .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , I mean they use them in calculators so .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Maybe we could start with the black and white .
C :  Yeah .
A :  That that way we could upgrade later .
B :  And you could yeah .
D :  Yeah , we talked about kinetic charging , we've deci seem to have decided on that , did we decide on double A_ or triple A_ batteries ?
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Well you cou um .
B :  Do you want like a back-up ?
D :  No , one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double A_ or triple A_ batteries 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ? I oh I see .
C :  K no the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch .
D :  Right , okay , got you .
C :  So it's a lot smaller , so it would
D :  Got you on that okay , didn't realise .
B :  Um , okay so we've got battery . The inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So there's not a really a decision to be made there , um .
B :  The buttons what did you give us as our
B :  The bare-board L_C_D_ or
C :  Yeah the well I think were we're going for the L_C_D_ on that one , on the buttons , on the on the on on the top one we're gonna yeah .
B :  On the top one okay you've got the touch okay and then
C :  On the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , the anti-R_S_I_ ones .
B :  Okay , okay .
D :  Sorry could you repeat that last part ?
C :  Um , okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the L_C_D_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons .
D :  L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  And for the sorry .
B :  No , it's fine .
A :  For the body design I think plastic , uh w yeah we could use the body , for the inside and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design .
C :  Plastic , okay .
B :  For the inside .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm , so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , okay .
A :  Plast right .
B :  Oh I think so , I think so .
D :  and it is just uh although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , just go for the colours .
C :  Mm no .
B :  No I think I we don't wanna be tacky if we've got a kind of different shape anyway um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , but that's not really what we're focusing on , what we're focusing on is the m you know yes . So we could just pick anything .
A :  It's
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  The feel .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Mm-hmm . Is that going to be this image I've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . Is that really going to fit fancy look and feel which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , is that fancy ?
A :  Uh I it's different .
B :  It's just different it's just different from everything else and I mean , I'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses , sort of beige and black um so you either want something that goes with that , which is what's on the market anyway , or you want something that contrasts as you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and
D :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  I'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , but I mean I totally agree . We looked at those remotes , I mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things . This would definitely be different enough , I just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more
B :  Mm .
B :  And you would just have an across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little
D :  Well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming I mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , which is another beauty of it .
B :  Mm .
B :  And ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes y you know , you could just go so far with it , like a puffer fish , you could just , you could take it wherever , so I think that's quite a flexible thing .
A :  Right .
C :  You can you can just
A :  Acupressure , you could talk of acupressures .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And finally the body should be retouchable , may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah , yeah j with these rubber these rubberised ca not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside .
B :  Mm .
A :  Okay . The rubber .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay we've got five minutes , um , or that might've been up for a while .
A :  Fine .
D :  Mm , so can I just recap uh Sarah , for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , um L_C_D_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . That's how far we've got , what else do we have to add to our decisions here ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost .
D :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So , are we looking at voice ?
D :  Yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , but it's a good idea we just need to check on the cost , is that right ?
A :  Or maybe like uh William was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains .
C :  Oh yeah , yeah the whistle ones , yeah .
A :  For l yeah , the whistle . So we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle .
D :  And incorporating the company logo ?
A :  Yep .
B :  Have you
A :  Uh sorry I didn't mention this , but we'll be incorporating in the design .
D :  Mm . 'Cause I took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little R_R_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product don't they ?
B :  Okay .
B :  Well they do , but I think we can you could well it is , it is , I think you just address that with um advertising . Um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is and that does the work for you . Obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , but everything else has a logo on it . The point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently but I think it does , without that so I'm not worried about that .
D :  Since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay . Did we I know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , I think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ?
B :  Depending on how i I mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so
C :  Yeah , depending on the expense of it .
C :  And they've got in stock , so yeah .
B :  um that seems to make sense , but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . But I think we'll find out more about cost afterwards . Right I'm going to wrap it up there .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Fine .
B :  I got a end meeting now message on my mo yeah so . Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Did it ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Again a questionnaire huh ?
B :  so I think we've probably got it says , closing we have forty minutes so I um think we've probably got about that time before we come back .
D :  You got to go through .
B :  It's either that or
B :  we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed and don't know how long that took .
A :  I think we are pretty going in a clear direction now .
B :  Is everyone happy ?
B :  Okay .
C :  Um we are So the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . So switching over I've just left uh my first two screens . Um I have
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . Um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that
D :  Okay . Cool .
C :  are particularly bothering you ?
D :  Mm um . No , I don't think so .
C :  No ? Okay , cool . Then we shall start with a presentation from Raj .
A :  No .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Hi , me Raj , again . Uh in this meeting I I'm going to discuss about the trend watching , uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . So we have to look on this .
B :  First of all methodology . The met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way We have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit .
B :  So what are our findings ? In our uh in our findings we have seen that when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . So this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . So we should take into uh we should consider this factor as the most important factor , because this factor is twice as important , the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . So this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls .
D :  The last one is the most important one , is it ? Oh , sorry .
B :  No the first one is the uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , the fancy design uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . The second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . We must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . So it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . So that indicates our technological advancement .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  And the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . And it should be uh and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . So that they could know how to use these remote controls .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  When we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that
D :  Sorry . I was just reading fruit and vegetables . Hard to know how we are going to incorporate that .
B :  Ah yeah ?
B :  Y yeah uh yeah , we have to , because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , becoming more and more organic , becoming Yeah . So Yeah . So something like that we we should do .
D :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  We should make a big sponge lemon , and then it'd be it would be yellow . It's Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Th that's very good .
D :  Glow-in-the-dark .
D :  Okay .
B :  And people uh the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . Yeah . Yeah . So so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . So that should also be taken into consideration . So these are my views . So
D :  Well , that's good . That's what we kind of predicted anyway .
A :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay , the spongy , not real spongy , you can Do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ?
B :  No it ca y a The rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co Yeah . 'Cause we It shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , so we don't want to have any harm to the society , so
D :  Okay . Quite disposable . Okay .
D :  Oh okay .
C :  Alright , okay .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  Okay .
C :  Fashion .
D :  Cool .
C :  Mm 'kay . Fruit and veg , well there you go . Just what I think of when I think of a remote control .
B :  So that's all .
D :  Mm . A remote control ? Yeah .
D :  And were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ?
B :  S uh we didn't find out any such point . Uh yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so
D :  Or was it just Okay .
C :  Mm-mm-mm-mm .
D :  Cool .
C :  Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm .
D :  F_ , what is it ? Um .
C :  Function F_ eight .
D :  yeah .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Oh no , .
D :  No signal .
D :  Is that ?
A :  No , it's got it's got it .
B :  Yeah , uh yeah , uh yeah . Yeah .
C :  Excuse me .
D :  Okay , and then F_ five , right ?
C :  Uh , yeah .
D :  Okay . Um
D :  okay , so the interface concept um .
D :  Yeah . The interface specification , what people um how they interact with it basically , I think . Um so the method , we looked at existing designs , what are the what's good about them , what's bad about them , um I looked at their flaws , so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . Um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , so a bit of imagination . Uh the findings , I've got some pictures to show you as well . Yeah .
C :  Mm 'kay .
C :  either .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . Um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . So I think for our remote control There is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , but I think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons like the the top right for on and off or something , I think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use .
C :  Uh okay .
C :  Right , okay . Yeah .
D :  And we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . Do I press Escape F_ five ? Or just
C :  Excellent .
C :  Uh no just escape
D :  Escape , okay .
C :  should uh
D :  Um , oh I still haven't got my glasses on . Yeah , okay . So these are the some of the pictures of existing ones . I'll just walk you through them . This one is a voice recognition . And that's the kind of idea we're going for . There's um an L_C_D_ thing , which we thought could I thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . This one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , which Yeah . Um and But I'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , like would the computer come
A :  Wow .
C :  'Kay .
C :  Looks pretty complicated .
C :  Right , okay .
C :  Mm-hmm , like the middle button .
C :  Okay .
C :  Ah it's kinda like scrolling uh right , well , if I s if I'm thinking of the right one , I've got the same thing in front of my monitor , you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . Right , okay .
D :  Uh-huh , that's like the L_C_D_ one , is it ? But the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . But I presume that the functions must come up on the T_V_ screen .
C :  Yeah , presumably .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I think that's what that is . So these are just a few ideas . Again that's just quite boring shape , grey , looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , I think on that one .
A :  Uh it looks threatening .
C :  Yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet .
D :  Yeah , it does look kind of dangerous .
A :  It looks like yeah .
D :  Um this one I thought was really cool . It's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . You can put it in there , it's for your kids , and it's quite an organic shape and the little circle around there is pretty cool . And that's really easy to use , bright , so I like this one lot for our design . I think something like that would be good . Of course yellow .
B :  Hmm .
C :  Okay .
A :  Wow .
C :  Yeah , I m I mean the one thing I think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , I've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . So like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever .
D :  Right , yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's true . Yeah . Um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the T_V_ or something . And this one , the over-sized one , I don't know about you , but I think it's a bit too gimmicky . I don't think that will sell very well .
C :  Yeah . I mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ?
D :  I guess so . I don't know . I think that's a bit
C :  Strange .
A :  Then d blind don't watch T_V_ . They do ?
D :  Yeah exactly . Yeah . And um this one is just pointing out . I like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . So that could that's a bit confusing . Um but the buttons on this I think are it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . They don't have to be all the same . So that's quite cool . Um .
C :  No they do , they do . They listen to it . Yeah .
C :  Right , okay .
C :  'Kay but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ?
D :  Yeah , exactly . Um F_ five . Yes .
D :  So there are some of the findings . So we need to combine those ones um and I've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . Um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . Um so I think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . It's you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , so that's And it's much Yeah .
C :  Brilliant .
C :  That's handy .
C :  Okay .
D :  So that's quite cool . Uh personal preferences just some imagination , the raised symbols I thought were good , the L_C_D_ , it does look smart , but I think maybe for our budget , do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the
A :  The L_C_D_ and the other stuff uh , I think .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And the speech recognition , 'cause I think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , are we ?
B :  But in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . Uh yeah . Yeah . So even if we increase our cost little bit , within uh some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , I think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market .
D :  Uh-huh .
C :  Okay .
D :  Uh-huh . But our budget , we've Yeah .
C :  It's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
D :  I'm not sure if the if for twenty five Euros uh per uh twelve Euros fifty m manufacturing cost , .
A :  Ben bana
C :  Yeah .
C :  I can't see tha Although , th I mean to be to be sure they have got I mean they are going crazy with the L_C_D_ technology now , so that you've got your L_C_D_ T_V_s and everything so maybe the small
D :  The L_C_D_ .
D :  Yeah .
C :  But I mean like I I the black and white , I guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . Um but , I mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour L_C_D_ screens , w I ju I mean I wouldn't know about the costs of them .
D :  No .
D :  Yeah . S
A :  Hmm .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  But uh price price not withstanding um , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ?
C :  Twelve fifty .
B :  And the
B :  Uh i it will be easy because there will be , on L_C_D_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa
C :  Possibly .
D :  Yeah , that's the thing , because
A :  But but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , right ? You're looking at the T_V_ and and it's uh It just seems kind of like a a needless th
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  That's true , yeah .
D :  And one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so I think I'm not sure about the L_C_D_ . It's a it's great , it's a good idea , but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , I think . Child-friendly , I thought this was good , as you pointed out the um
C :  Right .
D :  the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , but it's a good shape and the organic is kind of we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , I think .
C :  Yeah . Well I mean we could make a Yeah . Well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , I think your lemon wasn't that far s And if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon .
A :  So which vegetable ? Okay .
D :  Yeah , I know , carrot .
A :  The the lemon . Well what are the options ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  But we don't want it to be Yeah . Um the child-friendly , yeah . Easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . I like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . I think that's a good idea to go for .
C :  Mm-hmm . I like I like the colourful buttons as well .
D :  Yeah . And the mouse one , I thought it was a good idea , because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . Um .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , so most people
D :  Yeah .
C :  will have come in contact with that kind of use .
D :  S yeah . So they'd be able to use that um , as I said I think i I'd presume it would come up on the screen . Um so there you go .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the T_V_ maker , so
D :  Yeah .
A :  Oh .
D :  So that's um the user interface
C :  'Kay .
D :  design .
C : 
D :  So okay , I'll take this out now then .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um so
D :  There you go .
A :  I guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among ,
C :  Yeah , looks like it .
A :  and I'll I'll give you the uh , I guess , technical considerations for those .
D :  Mm .
C :  Uh
A :  And I'm gonna use the whiteboard , just 'cause we haven't used it .
C :  Yeah , I was just thinking the self same thing .
A :  Right . So , the way I'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , and then we'll throw in our new innovations um and keep it all within budget .
C :  Magic man .
A :  So uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . Um this is what they sent me .
A :  'Kay . Here's uh the competition , I suppose .
A :  Um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , um and there's a a chip , a processor , the T_A_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , and ch
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ?
A :  Right , it's very they're very cheap remote . This remote costs nothing , you know . Um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , and then that gets sent to the uh to the L_E_D_ light , which I can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . Oh here it is .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Right .
A :  Um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , because it it defines the uh
C :  Okay . So can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ?
A :  R Um no , I mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make .
C :  They gotta be
C :  Almost a key-ring .
A :  Right . So this is what we need to have for certain .
C :  Okay .
A :  Um . So you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , amplifier and transmitter are all standard . Um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail I got from our manufacturing team
A :  uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot ,
A :  um latex , double-curved , curved .
A :  So lots of choices , what do we think ?
C :  'Kay .
A :  Uh or sponge , I guess , isn't on there , right . Organic sponge .
C :  Well .
D :  Mm . I'm not sure about the sponge .
C :  Well , I mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , doesn't it . Um
A :  Uh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure .
C :  Yeah . And that would k also give it kinda durability and
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
C :  and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . Um so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ?
A :  Yeah so
A :  Okay so , here are a a plastic ,
A :  uh latex
D :  I like the rubber , the stress balls , I think , you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and
C :  Oh right , okay .
C :  I don't know what that stuff is .
A :  Oh right .
A :  So something with give to it . Okay . And
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  And that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around .
A :  and the colour is yellow , right ?
D :  Yeah , y yellow incorporated , yeah .
C :  Or at least incorporating , yeah .
A :  Yellow , okay . Um .
C :  I mean I forgot i we're sort of uh
C :  I don't know what other standard silver kind of
D :  I think
D :  Mm .
C :  Other parts or uh
D :  Yeah , the buttons w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours or i if we're having buttons actually , I don
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm' kay .
A :  So yellow for the body , and then what colour for the buttons ?
C :  Um .
C :  Um I quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So multi-coloured buttons .
D :  You do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah .
C :  Yeah or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps .
D :  Makes it easy to use .
D :  Yeah , that's true , because that blue one did look quite hardish .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . Although I mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . I mean if we are gonna make it a novel I mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use ,
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
C :  a bit comfier , you know .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go
A :  Um how exactly ? Maybe
A :  double
D :  Like uh an hour glass kind of figure , is that what you're thinking of , or just like a
C :  Yeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it .
D :  It's not Yeah .
A :  What about a banana ?
D :  We could make novelty remote controls .
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , 'cause it's yellow fruit , right ?
C :  Well , yeah , I mean like
C :  Yeah , yeah . Mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . But then how would you point it ?
B :  Ah yeah . Mm-hmm .
D :  How would you point it ? What
A :  Oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , I guess . We could have a little L_E_D_s on each end .
B :  Yeah , I appreciate this idea , because then this this will help us in our advertisement also and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . That what our data shows that , so this w this w
C :  They only cost pennies .
D :  Yeah .
D :  y I'm I'm not sure about the banana idea .
C :  Huh ?
C :  Um .
A :  So a spongy banana re Yeah .
C :  I mean that that th
D :  Rubber banana . Okay .
C :  does it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe .
D :  Yeah . I think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . And what else did you say about fashions ? What was trendy ?
A :  Okay , okay .
B :  Uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , like people uh now
C :  S
A :  See
C :  And sponginess .
D :  And spongy , yeah .
A :  So maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable like so it would have a stem perhaps and a
B :  Spongy .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Maybe , yeah .
A :  maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric .
C :  Huh .
D :  Like what's what's that , I don't even know the name of it , some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . I don't know the name of that .
A :  So it'd look like this kinda .
D :  Yeah , that's what I was thinking .
A :  Like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ?
C :  Uh .
D :  Yeah , maybe that's what they are .
D :  'Cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit and
A :  Yeah , and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , why the hell not . Let's that'll make us fifty million Euros .
D :  I don't know . What do you guy What do you think ?
C :  Um . Well , I guess it's kind of dra uh you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , yeah ?
D :  No .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , then only we can relate it with something . Yeah . Exactly .
C :  Yeah , we can relate it by advertising or
A :  Okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want .
D :  Uh-huh .
C :  There's a good man . There's a good idea .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay um , I guess , since you're the marketing guy .
B :  Yeah , sure . I will be happy to do that .
A :  We'll uh
A :  Okay , we could do that . Um .
D :  Okay .
D :  And buttons would , did we say ? Uh different shapes of buttons ?
C :  Um I l I su I mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . They've got , I mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um
D :  Mm .
A :  Okay , so
A :  so buttons .
C :  things that are always used .
D : 
A :  Okay , just like that .
C :  That's cool . I like it . Um .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . With the scroll-wheel or no ?
D :  Yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ?
C :  Uh speech recognition , I think , so we need a microphone presumably .
A :  Okay uh I could put the microphone here .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay there's the microphone .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Where should I put the microphone ?
C :  I mean ho h h wel are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ?
D :  Yeah , I'm not sure . Um I mean those ideas I saw were just for inspiration , I think . Um yeah , I can no I'm not sure .
C :  Glad , we're not doing this for real .
A :  Okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ?
D :  I couldn
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  And uh I think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . So should the microphone be just anywhere on it or
C :  I would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay there's the mic .
C :  So it can be sort of held and w We really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition .
D :  That's cool .
A :  Um n well we can
A :  Whoops .
C :  Oops . Um .
A :  Um .
D :  So let's not use the whiteboard any more .
A :  Yeah . Um .
C :  Upsidaisy .
A :  Oops , sorry . Okay .
D :  And uh so what else was there ? Um the What about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? Are we just gonna leave that ?
C :  I s I still like it . Um but that's me .
D :  You still like it .
D :  'Cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system .
A :  Right .
C :  Yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . I mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . Um don't wanna sort of overkill .
D :  'Cause um it could Yeah .
D :  Especially with yellow . Mm . I dunno .
A :  Hmm .
C :  'Cause I mean like uh if we I mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? Do we want to go for buttons at all , do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ?
D :  Then you put it in the fruit bowl ?
A :  They can work from a You don't have to hold it .
C :  Yeah , you know , and then you just tal I mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . Um .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , you know they have uh fruits all round them . Now just make sure they don't eat the remote .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Make them make them think of fruit , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  I mean uh some uh I l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , I dunno , an apple .
D :  Yeah , do we need buttons ?
D :  Mm .
C :  Then it's just apple so sort of Uh , yellow apples though Hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I quite like the shape . I quite like the design of that , uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base .
C :  Yeah . Okay , yeah , that's good .
C :  Groovy .
A :  Okay . But yeah
D :  and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know .
C :  Yeah , .
A :  But yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . It can sit at a distance and pick it up still .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah . So I mean like you could actually
B :  Or we can we can do one thing , we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . So whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , it will look l Uh yeah . In that w
C :  Yeah , gives you the options .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So a selection of casings .
C :  It kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um
D :  Yeah , 'cause you said about disposable , didn't you ?
B :  S s sorry ?
D :  You said about disposable earli people want disposable things so we could do that , like have a choice .
B :  Uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , okay ? If somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . If somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . It will give apple shape look . So in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , without uh yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Like like mobiles , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay . We still need the buttons in the same places thought , don't we ?
B :  Yeah , button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . Yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , so half of that will be look the Yeah , not not the upper side . So from lower you can , it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . So in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . And
C :  You can standardise those , I mean .
D :  Oh , that's the other side . Oh , okay .
D :  Oh , half a fruit . Oh , okay , okay .
D :  Okay , okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah yeah .
C :  I think tho I think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , 'cause when if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . It doesn't really
D :  Mm mm .
C :  You know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down .
D :  Yeah .
C :  And you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Maybe .
A : 
A :  Okay , um so
C :  So you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options .
A :  Yeah , s I guess we decided on material , right ? So that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , and the colours we got down , and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Well , um because Well , I I'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , because I think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit and uh because what Yeah , w I think wh wha would we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . They wanted something that looks fancy and I think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . I mean we could make it nice pale yellow .
C :  Okay , so we stick with what we've got there .
C :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . So again I mean like we could have , uh I mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah . Maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan .
C :  colour , but have
C :  kinda going round , yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Because
C :  Um I mean e even if I mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . So you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Uh-huh .
C :  W sort of
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Great . Um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , but we don't have to be limited by that . We can use a hand-dynamo . Um I don't know what that means , we crank it ?
C :  Uh It's I think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . Uh yeah .
A :  Right , it's like those watches that you c So , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power .
D :  Oh , a d a dynamo ?
B :  Yeah , .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I like that , yeah .
D :  Yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . Yeah that's quite cool .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . So if it if it's not working , I guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing .
C :  Okay .
B :  But
C :  You shake it and scream at it . Yeah .
B :  But but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? Because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat Yeah , to mo Yeah .
D :  Yeah , it is , yeah .
C :  It does leave them with an obligation to Especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . Then if it's just sitting on the
B :  Yeah , because most of the people Yeah .
A :  Right .
D :  Yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then Yeah .
C :  Okay , okay . Right um what are the other options ?
D :  That's true .
A :  Okay .
A :  Uh there's solar power . Um .
B :  Uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , and the days when there is no sola sunlight Yeah . Yeah . What we w yeah . I think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . They can they can recharge it .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I'm I'm with uh Raj on that , I think , you know , I've got I've got no I've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window .
A :  Okay , so probably just
D :  But w like just normal light ?
C :  Oh that's true .
C :  I mean I w I w uh that idea that I thought um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother is having a ,
A :  Mm .
D :  And we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ?
C :  yeah , having a rechargeable stand , so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Like like a hand like one of those portable phones kind of thing .
C :  Yeah that kind of thing .
B :  Yeah , that's Yeah , exactly .
A :  Okay .
A :  So uh a rechargeable battery . Okay . Um the user interface , the buttons , I guess we talked about this already .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Rechargeable .
D :  Mm .
C :  . What's chip on print ? What's
A :  Um .
A :  Hmm ?
C :  Sorry , never mind .
A :  Uh th the uh the electronics um , basically the more features we add um
A :  Oops , this one . So the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , which adds to the cost as you can expect . Um .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But uh I think we can keep it all under budget .
A :  So uh yes , so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . So just in time .
D :  Mm-hmm . Just in time .
C :  Yeah , and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of
C :  chipping .
A :  Right , right .
C :  That's good . Uh woah . Okay , we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um Excuse m I've just deleted that whole thing . Um we're kind of running out of time , so if you could
A :  Yeah , and keeping the L_C_D_ screen out .
C :  Uh .
C :  Was that you ? Um that was your bit's covered , I just dele I just accidentally deleted what I was supposed to say next .
A :  Huh ?
A :  Oh yeah that was that was it .
B :  Uh excuse me , Bri
C :  Um , yeah . Oh , yeah .
A :  So control F_ eight , right ?
D :  Yeah , mine seems to have turned off . I can't do anything .
C :  And I just touch the pad .
B :  You just touch the pad , yeah .
D :  No .
C :  It's actually shut down .
B :  No ?
D :  It's on , but there's nothing on the screen .
C :  Okay , um now what we have uh our next meeting's in half an hour and what I would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay .
A :  Try uh flipping the screen down .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Oh , I get to do it , too .
C :  Yeah . It's you guys . Yeah . So um , you know I mean , luckily we chose a nice simple shape . Um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches .
A :  Oh neat .
D :  Cool .
D :  Yeah . Mm .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  That's great .
A :  Okay . Save everything to the shared documents , is that right ?
C :  Uh yeah , I hope I can recover this , 'cause I've accidentally deleted it . Which doesn't really help me much .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I think , I've saved mine already .
C :  Yeah , can you save that uh send that last one again , please , Raj , as I still can't find it on the
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh it was under a different name . I will show you , in shared documents .
C :  Okay .
B :  Uh working components . Oh , you didn't get that . I will send new . Uh I'll put it in shared documents , again .
C :  No . Okay , thank you .
C :  Um yeah , Project , Project Documents .
B :  Project documents , sorry , I put it in the shared documents .
C :  Uh right , that's that's the that it goes there automatically if you put it in Project Documents . Project Documents is on the um desktop .
B :  Uh yeah .
B :  Right , that's great . But I cou can't open that , because it w asks uh for some username or password .
A :  Oh .
C :  Really ?
B :  I'll show you .
A :  Uh these lapel mics are trouble .
C :  Oh right , I think um Hold on . Yeah , I don't know if y it it just ca it just came up on my um
B :  Sorry .
B :  Uh .
C :  on my agenda . S Um presumably there's clay somewhere . Um .
C :  Four .
B :  Yeah , that's great .
C :  Whoops . Light , light , please . Light . Right , there you go .
B :  Yeah , th thank you .
C :  Yeah , quite . And we're using this our basic chip set , so it's all good .
B :  Oh sorry .
A :  Are we done with our meeting ?
B :  Uh excuse me , Brian . You have to keep your pen separate , because I used your pen .
C :  Um I think we're almost done , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Oh oops . Sorry man .
B :  S
C :  Uh okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits so we had rechargeable and
C :  Uh .
C :  Apples . Mm-mm-mm-mm-mm .
C :  'Kay , so we came up with that , that's okay . What's supplements ? Supplements . Uh uh .
C :  See .
D :  Cool .
D :  Fun .
C :  I shoulda something like that . If I kn see I I knew that . I shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape . Just for cruelty .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah . Star fruit .
B :  Hmm .
C :  I wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything .
B :  So sh should
B :  Should we leave now , Brian ? Or we are going to discuss something ?
D :  No . Oh yeah , we can do buttons .
C :  Um .
C :  Uh no , I think that's us our discussion over unless anybody's got questions or confusions , 'cause I'm confused .
D :  No I'm good .
B :  Yeah . Excuse me .
C :  Huh ?
D :  Okay .
C :  Um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , it's a
D :  Mm .
B :  Sorry . Thank you . Yeah .
C :  There we go . Warning , finish meeting now .
B :  So .
C :  I rounded it up far too fast . Um . Where are we going ? My Documents , that's not what I want . My Project Documents .
C :  There we go .
C :  Excellent . So um I sent you the agenda , it was on the in the project documents . I don't know if you got a chance to just have a look at it . Anyway , it's the meeting's gonna follow more or less the same structure as last time , so we'll go round each of you in turn and you can give your presentations on what you've been up to . Um and at the end of that we need to discuss what you've come up with , so that we can make a decision on the key remote control concepts , so that's we need to know about the components' properties , materials , the user interface and any trends that the Marketing Expert has been watching .
A :  Right .
C :  Okay . Um , do you wanna start again ? Let me we've got forty minutes .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right s so I haven't made a PowerPoint presentation , yeah , I I thought I'll use the whiteboard instead . Um mm , okay , so basically I'll start off by uh I thought I'll use the whiteboard because we have so many different options and what we can do is that we can start um uh rubbing off the options that we do not require and putting in the options that uh are m or highlighting or underlining them or something like that .
C :  You haven't made a PowerPoint , okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Let's hope the pen holds out .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so uh I'll start again with a brief introduction to connect that anyway brief introduction to the insides of a remote control and uh then we can probably uh discuss the various components . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so w what you see here is so this is the outside of the remote , right ? If you open it , you have a circuit board here , right , and this is the chip that I was talking about last time . This basically sends information to a tr uh transistor here , which then uh sends the information to an L_E_D_ device here . If you flip the printed circuit board , and this is th the most important point here , uh everything else is kind of
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so if you flip the circuit board , this is what it looks like . So you see for example a particular button attaches to a particular place on the P_C_B_ and uh on pressing this button I a circuit completes , the information goes to the chip , which is somewhere here and the chip that tra then translates the code into an infra infrared radiation , which goes goes out through there . So uh the important point that I read over the website was uh that the configurations of these printed circuit circuit boards uh are quite cheap to make , you can ge get them printed as you want to , so w we can have a configuration um irrespective of the cost , the way we want to have . Right ? So that's the important point here , so these are the different options that we have .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . So the batteries , I'll start with the battery , right ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So they can be simple which is like uh the normal batteries in uh our uh the cells , yeah ? Uh thes these are the kind different kind of batteries that the company makes , right ? So .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And dynamos .
A :  Um yeah , yeah . So uh I don't know if even if you want to consider this , but these are the different things that the company makes , so th they'll they'll since uh they'll come internally from the company , they'll be eas uh cheaper , uh all these options . So the third one is uh the kinetic energy ones .
B :  Does that mean like a wind-up one ?
B :  A wind-up remote .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  You could make the hand dynamo into an exercise bike , and then people could exercise whilst watching T_V_ .
A :  Yeah .
C :  And charging their remote , yeah .
B :  Yeah , and stop worrying about the whole R_S_I_ from the remote thing , 'cause that's just
A :  Yeah , it's a good option . The the kinetic energy one is uh that e uh uh they are usually modern watches , since our hand keeps moving , it keeps the watch ticking . But I dunno i if it is a good idea for a remote control , because it'll just lie there for a long while sometimes . But as soon as you pick it up it moves and then again it uh re recharges or something . And the fourth option is the solar cells , which are also made by the company . Environment friendly . Okay um so I'll list things and then we can come back and discuss what what we think from uh everybody's perspective . There are different cases that can be provided . They can be basically the shape of the cases , they can be flat , they can be curved with uh one-sided
D :  So what was what was this k ka
D :  Okay .
C :  Uh yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  For a remote , 'cause you
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  curved and one side flat , and they can be curved with on both the sides .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  These are the three options , right ? Um
D :  Um you mean this would be like the the overall shape of the remote control , yeah , mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , would it be flat on both the sides , would be curved from one side , or whatever uh there were different kind of supplements available , um like it can be in plastic , rubber , wood , or titanium , right ? Wo wo wood .
D :  Yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
B :  Did you say wool ?
C :  Wood , wood . A fluffy remote .
B :  Wood . Oh right .
A :  Yeah . Not wool .
B :  .
B :  Yeah , you'll understand why when we get to my presenta .
A :  Oh really ? Okay . Um the so uh we can use even um a certain titanium is also used uh in the company to make uh uh some space design equipment , so it's kind of um uh it'll be probably nicer to use , because it relates to the overall image of the company , but uh it cannot be used on a double curved surface . If we choose this , we cannot use titanium . For for these two we can use titanium , wood , rubber , or plastic . Yeah ? Uh okay , the interface options now . So
C :  Huh .
C :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  we can have push-buttons , like most remotes do and our company is an expert in making push-buttons .
A :  Ooh . Uh we can have scroll wheels like the ones on um uh mouse pointers uh uh
B :  Sony .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Sony Ericsson mobile phones has it .
A :  Yeah , yeah , something like that . So , and they have they can even have an an integrated uh push-button inside the scrolling thing . The scroll plus push . So this is something that has been recently developed by the company , um in the last decade , so not too recent . And L_C_D_s , we can have L_C_D_s . So these two are recent and and this is q quite old . The various electronic options are um
B :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  uh so th this concerns firs first of all the the chips I I showed you at uh so there's there's a chip behind this one , right ? The P_C_B_ is uh inexpensive , so we can put put in uh whatever we want , but the various integrated circuit options are , we have either a simple one
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  or a regular
A :  or advanced .
A :  And uh the price goes up
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  as we go down , obviously . Um okay , so the good thing about uh wh wh why why we would want to use advanced u why we might want to use advanced is that L_C_D_s can only come with the advanced chip . Um the we need regular or advanced for uh scroll wheels .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right ? Um and the chip basically includes the infra infrared sender .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Uh besides this in electr under electronics uh also the company has started making a sample sender , which is did not explained what i what it was , but I'm guessing that uh so they have a sample sender and a sample speaker .
A :  So I'm guessing that uh the sample speaker is probably something like um uh you know , as soon as you press a button , it it mm uh give gives you feedback , one five or whatever . Yeah , on . Um and uh I dunno whether sample sender sender has to do something with voice recognition or not , but anyway . So , these are the different options that we have .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so th that's that's basically now now uh I think that uh we can integrate um uh you know , uh the user interface uh and uh the marketing things in that , keep uh taking out things from this and uh underlining things that are important , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Excellent . Do you wanna stay somewhere near the board , so that if we need to you can sit down , but just we might need you to leap up .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , yeah , sure . Sure . Yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  What are you , PowerPoint , or
D :  Um I have some PowerPoint , yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Right .
D :  Oh .
C :  Do you think these pens can give you cancer of the hand ? Some sort of radiation ?
D :  'Kay .
B :  No it's got its little camera in there , plug it in .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  'S a
A :  Yeah , it should should do it . Yeah .
C :  Right , interface concept .
D :  Okay . Um to be honest actually , I mentioned some some of the things which which could fit on the on the this talk um this time , I m I mentioned them already in the previous talk . So um yeah , this time um I might not have them on the slides but I I can just mention them aw again . Okay .
C :  That's fine .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So um I thought um I would also include the definition of user interface um so it's the aspects of a of of a computer system or programme which can be seen uh by the user um and and which uh the mechanisms that the user uses to control its operation and input data . So this would p includes things like shape and size and buttons and um voice recognition as well , and colour , and so on .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um um the method I employed this time was a again having a look to related products and mainly on the internet and then um analyse them uh from the point of view of user fen friendliness and also um whether their appearance was was pleasant . Um and then um this uh this um
D :  this can help us to decide which features we want to incorporate in our product . So some findings um um .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So in in the case of many user interfaces , they're just so full of buttons that it's actually uh hard to find the ones you you really um want to use and um and it's just confusing , it takes y know time to learn . Um okay , and I thought I would just quickly show some of them that I found .
D :  Okay , some of them are here . Um well the picture is not very clear , but as you can see , there are actu oi , oh oh oh , sorry for that .
D :  'S go back .
A :  That's nice one .
D :  Ah , no , please .
D :  Okay , so yeah , they're quite big and have many many buttons . Actually of the of all these I personally p prefer this one , because it's it's the smallest and and with with least uh with the smallest number of buttons as well . And I would say even the appearance of some of them is kind of not so nice . Um okay .
B :  Ugly .
C :  Mm .
D :  So let's carry on with this . Um
D :  So uh um o other findings um some new things um used , uh some of them were mentioned already by our Technical um Designer uh . Our own company has developed a new in user interface uh wait , no this is not the one .
D :  Okay , there is a we can uh include voice recognition and um it allows i it's possible to record eighty different voice samples on it . Uh so uh this uh this one was already mentioned uh the L_C_ display .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  It's yeah .
D :  Um s another new development is a scroll button , which was also th also already mentioned . And uh our own manufacturing division ha has uh designed a new um
D :  uh programmable speech uh
D :  mm sorry uh speaker unit I guess it's it should be . Um and this means that um once uh uh it it it comes together with a voice recognition , but it's once once the mm um gadget uh recognises uh the voice of the speaker , there can be a um pre-programmed answer , for example , you can pick up the remote control and say something to it like hello and it says some hello and your name or whatever . So I mean this is also one of the n dev new developments which we might consider if we wanted to include .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Uh-huh , hi yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Uh sorry , uh can you go back for a second ? Um uh are you sure wha what this means , a spinning wheel with the L_C_ display ? Uh oh yeah are th
C :  It's like the like you said , no ? The scroll scroll wheel .
D :  No no , the scroll button is a different thing . I I have a picture if you just a moment , I'll I'll show you . I wasn't completely sure myself , but I think it's just like um it's it's a wheel , it's like not separate buttons . Look , this one here . But I'm I'm not really sure whether whether you can really turn it round , it's like you press this or this or
B :  Yeah , you can't
A :  Oh okay , the iPod thing , yeah .
B :  Oh , it's like the iPod .
B :  G yeah , no , you can . It's like it's like where you you know how you have your your mouse , and y you go round and i it's kind of like that and you spin round and it yeah . It is
A :  Uh it's the iPod uh kind of uh
C :  Uh-huh .
A :  Alright , right . Okay , okay .
A :  So instead of going down you just spin yeah , yeah .
B :  You just go round and it is a bit weird at first , but it's actually very like fast .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh-huh .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  I like the the wheels that click on the side you you get 'em much slower , so it's quite good if you like searching quite a lot of stuff . Do you know , if you're lookin if you're th scrolling through the A_ to Z_ of your music and you're looking for something at T_ , then it's a lot faster than the wheel , but you've got a lot less control over it .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right . So maybe I should include that here as well , L_C_D_s um plus spinning .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Uh
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , and the personal preferences are pretty much the same as as as last time . It it has to be small , simple . Okay , we decided to include voice recognition , so to have the standard uh major buttons like on , off , um ch the channels and and then um volume and then the rest would be a menu on the screen .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um and I I also thought uh if we want to keep it small and nice um and actually I I quite like the idea of a scroll a scrolling button , I thought it could be for for voice like , I dunno , it mm like on a um i like it used to be on Walkmans or something . There is uh I think there is no reason why we couldn't use something like this for for the remote control .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  So yeah , that's uh that's it .
C :  Excellent . Okay , straight to trends , and then we can discuss it all at once .
A :  Right .
B :  Okay , I've put the copy of the presentation in um the yeah .
C :  The project documents . Excellent . If you two could both do that as well , in case we need to refer to it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Cool .
C :  Here it comes .
C :  Okay .
B :  Fabulous . Okay , cool . Um so what I did was to search the internet to come up with market trends and you know what users are gonna be wanting in the the near future . Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right . Now , the first aspect is apparently twice as important as the second aspect , which is twice as important as the third a aspect . So , I mean the the easy to use thing is fairly low down on the which I think given the target group is what you would expect , really .
C :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um , you know , people want something new , something technologically innovative and different , so the whole idea with the L_C_D_s and the spinning and the colours and the voice recognition is quite like , quite the thing to go for . And um , yeah it wants to look fancy , fancy look and feel . So
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  So um uh maybe uh as you're discussing things , is it okay if we just uh keep highlighting things here ? Right . So mm uh so it yeah , so probably voice recognition is is kind of important , right ? Um and an yeah . Okay , I I have a point about L_C_D_ , I dunno if it is the right point to take it up . W uh L_C_D_s are basically for feedback , right , to the user who's pressing buttons , and the feedback can come through television itself , so do we need an L_C_D_ on the remote ?
C :  Yeah , yeah , sure . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  That's over on the interface , if if you could put
C :  Yeah .
C :  And maybe the L_C_D_ and spinning so that means we need an advanced thing .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm .
B :  Depends how fast your television runs , really , don't don't you think ? I mean we've got one of those um Telewest boxes and you put the number in the remote and then you wait and then it goes to the T_V_ and then you wait , and then it comes , so i it actually takes quite a long time . And if you get the number in wrong , then it's a bit of a pain , so I think , you know , a screen on the remote would probably cut down your time on that . But like remotes do tend to get f thrown about a bit .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
A :  Right .
A :  Right .
C :  It it is also quite nice though to to have something here so you don't interrupt the picture on the screen , so if you're watching something
B :  You know ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  That's true , yeah , that's also
B :  And i it would be like I mean if you could make it integrate with the T_V_ then it could come up with new information about what's on , and you could just see that on the remote rather than
C :  Yeah . Rather than having to interrupt your viewing pleasure .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But um I think maybe a way to do it would be a similar way to how you have your mobile phone , you know , like you have the slidey ones and you have the flippy ones and then the screen's protected so it doesn't actually get scratched . So you can have like what looks like a normal remote control , you know or like a minimalist remote control . So you got your buttons one to nine , your on and off and your volume on that and then if you want to mess about with it , you flip it open and , yeah .
A :  Right .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm right .
C :  And then you can flip it open .
A :  Okay .
A :  So now we seem to have a consensus that L_C_D_s are definitely the way to go because of style and
C :  Yeah , I think so .
B :  Yeah , so that kind of decides your whole chip thing .
A :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
A :  You you agree ? Maarika , yeah ? Yeah .
D :  Yep , yeah .
C :  Right .
A :  So L_C_D_s , yeah , definitely . Go on .
B :  Okay ?
B :  Cool . Okay , apparently , fruit and vegetables will be providing inspiration . Sorry , I discovered clip art . Um so these will be an important feature for clothes , shoes and furniture . So I mean , I'm taking this to mean , you know , curviness .
B :  Do you know ? 'Cause you don't tend to get flat vegetables . You know ?
C :  Yeah , and possibly even uneven , like not not symmet yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , bit of asymmetry and stuff . But that would be a good way to to get in the whole um R_S_I_ issue in there , because I mean if you think most people use the remote control with their right hand ha right hands so you wanna you curve it so that it's suitable for use with the right hand . Um yeah , I'm not quite sure about the relevance of material will be spongy . Um
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Something a bit squishy and
B :  Yeah , but I mean y you have to
A :  Yeah , we we have we have rubber , but there is a problem that I forgot to discuss with the um with using
D :  So it could be like a rubbery yeah , uh-huh .
B :  Well I suppose you wouldn't get a remote uh an electric shock off your remote control if it was made of rubber .
C :  Yeah , and it'd help if you drop it , it protects it as well .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  To some degree .
A :  So if if we use uh latex cases , they won't allow us to use solar cells , as an energy source that is the constraint , so um we could use titanium , wood or plastic uh or uh
C :  Uh-huh .
C :  Or if we want to use the the latex , then we have to go with one of the other um power things .
B :  If it's made of rubber you could get the kinetic energy fairly easily there , you could just bounce it up and down .
A :  Yeah , w energy source .
C :  From from bouncing it . You can have it as like a little ball to bounce , that flips open .
A :  Yeah , tap it on the desk , yeah .
B :  Yeah . Um so yeah , um okay .
A :  Mm .
A :  So probably double curved surface is the way to go , yeah , .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Mm yeah .
A :  Or or curved at one end and flat on the top , because I I'm not sure if it is flat on both both the sides , then ho how much easy would it be to reach for buttons , etcetera . Um
B :  You have to have a certain element of flatness , I think . It it depends on the whole ergonomics of it , you know , it's like how you put your hands so y it's the least movement basically .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , singe single side curved or double side curved does not say too much , does it ? It uh
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  No , I d I don't think it makes a lot of difference . I I have one of those s slidey phones and I mean the back is essentially straight , but it's curvy , so . Besides , you have four sides to a thing , so I mean does curved one side mean one side is straight and , you know curved two sides means the whole thing is just a big curvy p thing ?
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Uh I think uh
C :  Yeah , 'cause the
C :  Yeah .
A :  Right .
A :  Right . Di now did it say anywhere in your research material about this sliding stuff uh because um according to the information that I have , I think uh the onl only options that we have with the case is are these three . Uh eith either we have uh a flat surfaced uh case or a curved surfaced case . It does not say anything about uh whether technically , you know , this this stuff is available at all .
C :  Dunno .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Nothing to open them .
B :  Yeah . Uh it's it's more about the protecting the L_C_D_ , which I think is where it came from . But no , my research didn't tell me anything , which is why we have all the pictures , 'cause I had nothing better to do with my time . Okay , cool .
A :  Right , yeah , yeah .
A :  Right .
A :  Okay .
C :  Anything else ? What've we got ?
B :  Uh combine style with a level of functionality , um beauty and practicality and a thing of beauty and p function .
A :  Cool , thanks .
C :  Okay , so .
B :  Okay ?
D :  Thanks
C :  Looking at what we've got , we we want an L_C_D_ display with a spinning wheel .
A :  Yeah . Let's let's try to r rub off things and yeah , so um hand dynamos are definitely out , right ?
C :  Yeah , rub off some of those .
C :  Yeah , it's not that's not streamlined and sexy , having a having a wind up .
A :  You you got a wind dynamo , yeah .
D :  Yeah uh-hum yeah .
A :  Okay . Um kinetic energy does seem to have some kind of uh uh appeal , but uh
C :  I think tha
B :  It's about the practicality of it really , isn't it ? You know ? I mean if
A :  it's
A :  Yeah . As against a watch , which constantly keeps moving , this this thing will have to be tapped every time , which which might be very frustrating for the user .
C :  Depends how much how much movement it really needs . Pr presumably if they're suggesting it , then we could use it . I'd I'd keep it on .
A :  Kinetic energy it needs I don't have too much technical information on that , yeah , right . Okay , let's keep it option uh keep an option , yeah . Um the flat co completely flat case is definitely out , right ? It has to be at least curved from one side , yeah .
C :  We don't want that it's no it's not not vegetable .
D :  Yeah it's yeah .
A :  Um okay , we still have all all the options . Wood , do you think wood will be a good idea ?
D :  N wood is I can't n how do you uh I mean you can't keep it really small uh you can't make it like thin and
A :  Mm .
A :  Right .
D :  The wood thing . Because you need to you n you need to put all the technology in , so I mean if the case you add the case and it it becomes a bit bulky wi mm-mm yeah .
B :  I can't imagine a m wooden remote control .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah if if it is really thin if it is really thin it it's likely to break , it's it's much more uh
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , and given that we're we're looking at more spongy material preferences , I ha would think maybe rubber or plastic is more
D :  U yeah wood is not really yeah .
B :  Well it's not very cleanable either , do you know . It's it's not a practical I mean it's it's alright for a table , but for a remote control , you know .
A :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That's true .
A :  Yeah .
B :  And splinters and stuff and
A :  Yeah , okay wood is out .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It just m doesn't make any sense , I think is the thing with wood .
A :  Right .
D :  Yeah , yeah , in the case of remote control not really .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , now for the really interesting stuff , the interface . Right , so uh the the push-buttons is is our expertise uh in the industry , but uh it seems to be out of trend , you know , nobody seems to be
C :  Yeah .
B :  You have to have some push-buttons , don't you ?
D :  Yeah , but you um I think for for the channel numb uh channel numbers you still need them , wouldn't you ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  G yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm right .
D :  Yeah , so for channel numbers but
A :  Oh , if if we have L_C_D_ displays , that opens up a whole world , you know , if you have an L_C_D_ display , then mm you can select almost everything on the L_C_D_ display .
D :  But I th yeah but I think the L_C_D_ display is kind of yeah , it's faster with a m yeah and w if we dis and when we s um discussed that we might like this flipping open thing , then I mean y you can use it as a normal remote control , but if you do want to use L_C_D_ , then you flip it open , but it's it it's more time-consuming .
C :  Just for fast
A :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . I think this is going back to the the graph at the beginning that I made , where , you know , the buttons that people use all the time , you want buttons for them and everything else menu-driven .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm right .
D :  Yeah .
C :  And it yeah L_ L_C_D_ .
A :  So uh in in the buttons we have for the channels also we have options . Do you do we enumerate everything from zero to nine ? Or do we have just uh channel plus , channel minus , just to just to scroll ?
D :  No , no , I mean mm we we definitely need the the numbers , because it's uh otherwise people don't want to flip through all the channels . Um
A :  The numbers .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Do we need them on as buttons or do we need them as L_C_D_ ?
A :  Right .
A :  Or on the L_C_D_ we can , you know
B :  G yeah , I would think buttons , yeah .
D :  Yeah , I would say buttons , because it's yeah .
C :  Buttons .
A :  Okay . So mm
B :  It's it's the I think the thing is , so if someone just wants to turn on their T_V_ and put on a channel , then it should be easier to use than any other remote , and then if someone wants to , you know , change the contrast on their T_V_ and they should be able to do that and it should be accessible , but , you know , I mean most of the time I mean there's a limit to how much the biggest techno geek can spend fiddling with the T_V_ , I think is the the the issue there .
C :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Alright .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so buttons definitely in but oh shall we uh try to draw a prec um
C :  I think that's what you guys are gonna do next , so if we put down the key um things that we want .
A :  Uh okay .
A :  Okay , okay , so the components . Right , so uh what about the the scrolling uh ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but n I I'm not completely um completely clear uh I yeah , about the spinning wheel . So I think it it doesn't make sense to have both like a scrolling and spinning thing , it's uh you can al include everything in the spinning if you yeah , yeah , in that case .
B :  E either or
C :  Just spinning and not scrolling , I would say .
B :  G yeah .
B :  I would say the s the s the spinning goes at a high speed to th to the scrolling wheel , so you have to decide whether you you know , you want to be going so fast or not . But I mean the the thing with this whole if y you're planning on making it out of rubber , on the basis that it's spongy , then I'm not sure how well a scrolling wheel would work .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Mm um
C :  But if you've got a if if you've got a flipped thing , effectively it's something that's curved on one side and flat on the other side , but you folded it in half . Th that would be on one side , uh-huh .
D :  Ah , but I mean you can
B :  Yeah , but y your spinning wheel tends to go to one side .
A :  I'm not sure it'll be a good idea to construct the whole thing out of rubber . Uh i it
C :  No , I think it's just the casing rubber on the outside .
D :  Yeah , I um I think so too , I mean the case would be yeah the case would be rubber and the the buttons ,
B :  You want an outside of rubber and then open it up and
A :  Or or at the corners , edges , just the edges covered by rubber or something like that . Everything else in plastic or even titanium if we want to use it .
C :  Yeah .
D :  rubber buttons , but then
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Or maybe like interchangeable cases .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  'Cause I know like we're going back to iPods again n the whole spinning wheel , but I have like a you know , obviously my iPod's not made of rubber , but then I have a little rubber case that goes over the top of it and I can change the colour , theoretically , to match my outfit .
C :  Mm .
A :  Right , right .
A :  Right , okay , so so that gives us a more trendy look as well . Um
B :  Yeah , I think the spinning wheel is definitely very now .
A :  Right . Yeah , and uh we're going more for the trends than for the usability anyway , right ? So
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  That's right , that's what they're after .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I'll rub that out .
A :  And uh colours can be provided with the case rather than
A :  Um but we still need to te think about the colour of our remote as such , you know , just keep it black , or
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah I think we um it was a a requirement that we use our um th the colours of our company , so would it be like yellow , grey and black or something , or
C :  I guess .
B :  That doesn't fit in with the whole vegetable theme though .
D :  Yeah , does
C :  Bananas .
D :  Yeah . Banana's yellow , yeah , definitely .
B :  Yeah , but I mean do you think we could incorporate the colours of the company into the buttons and then make the colour of the main remote the colour like vegetable colours , do you know ? So you could have like I mean I suppose vegetable colours would be orange and green and some reds and um maybe purple and that and then you'd pick the buttons in company colours to to match with it .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Green .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay . Um okay , if you g go over to uh the integrated circuits . Uh since we're having L_C_D_s there there's no way that we're will be able to um what we do need to consider , however , is that the price is going up for the ever every such thing that we are considering , but since L_C_D_s seems to be uh a definite yes , so it seems to be one area where we would want to spend .
C :  We need the advanced yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So I'll rub off the other two .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So are we discounting solar energy because rubber's gonna be used in there somewhere or
C :  That was the
A :  Oh is oh the constraint was uh yeah .
B :  If solar panels with the rubber .
C :  We can't have solar panels with rubber , so .
A :  Yeah . So
B :  Yeah , okay , so we lose that I think .
C :  Shall we go for if we're going for rubber , we think uh on as our case , and then
D :  Mm-hmm . And the buttons as well , I think . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I think uh we'll have uh uh using the simple battery will be a safer option as compared to the kinetic energy one , I mean , a although it does seem uh interesting . But it does not hold any advantages as such for a yeah .
C :  We've got five more minutes .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , mm-hmm .
B :  It's just a gimmick .
A :  Okay . Uh okay , so r we understand this better now that uh the the speaker is for the feedback , right ? It it says uh the things that you type in or something like that , so
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah . I think if we can if we can include them at not too much extra cost , then I'd put them in , but if it's
A :  Ye yeah , we we don't have too much information about it , um
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but it it I think it should be quite cheap because it's from our own company , yeah .
C :  It's from the company , so
A :  Yeah , okay , so so th this is in as well then , the sample speaker .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . And the case is curved on one side , but then flat flat , so it's flipped into each other .
A :  Right .
A :  Flat on the top .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Can I pull the thing out the back of your computer ?
B :  Yeah , sure j
C :  Just so we can
B :  Sorry , do you want me to
C :  Nothing , it's right , I'm just
C :  There we go .
B :  What does um I_C_S_ mean ?
A :  I_C_s ? Uh integrated circuits .
B :  Okay , cool . So it's advanced integrated circuits ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Uh oh now I've gone too far .
A :  Uh um we we're definitely going in for voice recognition as well as L_C_D_s , mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  We're on our way .
C :  Okay . So we've basically worked out that we're going with a simple battery , the advanced chip and a curved on one side case which is folded in on itself , um made out of rubber and
A :  Right .
A :  Yep .
C :  the buttons are also rubber . We're having push-buttons on the outside and then on the inside an L_C_D_ with spinning wheel , and we're incorporating voice recognition . That's our overall concept , and it's gonna look sort of vegetable , and be in bright vegetable colours .
D :  Um
D :  Uh-huh . So w w would with have the spinning wheel inside with the L_C_D_ , or would it be on the outer
B :  Imagine it would be inside . So um actually that could like really cut down your thing , so you've got your outside , which is like minimalist , and then you open it up and you've got a screen and a spinning wheel , which you can incorporate buttons into . Um so you've still not got like a lot of stuff in the
C :  I think it's on the
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-mm . Yeah .
C :  On the
B :  You've maybe got , you know like if you're modelling on iPod you've got five buttons and a wheel , and four of the buttons are in the wheel , and the other one's the little bit inside the wheel , yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  In the centre , yeah , sure . Okay , so now we've got thirty minutes before our next meeting . In the meantime , the Industrial Designer over here is gonna work on the look and feel design , which I'll presume he'll work out what that means . Um the User Interface Designer will work on the user interface design and the Marketing Expert is going to work on product evaluation . And as well as that , the two designers are going to work together on our prototype following those instructions that we've just come up with using modelling clay and you will get extra instructions from your personal coach . Is that all okay ? And anyone who hasn't put their their presentation in the project documents folder , it would be good just so in case we have to refer to it .
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Cool .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Cool , I'm gonna go and sit on my own .
C :  Y ah nobody wants to talk to you . Unplug yourself .
B :  I know , I'm hated .
D :  Hmm .
B :  I've got a bit tangled up in all this .
D :  So but shall I move away first or shall I stay here with we need to
C :  I dunno , maybe I would car
D :  Oh right okay .
D :  I cover myself up .
A :  I feel like Madonna with one of these on . I said I feel like Madonna with one of these on .
D :  .
D :  I've always wanted one of these , I really have . Where do you buy 'em from ?
D :  They're .
A :  Right . Hello everybody . Back again for another wonderful meeting . Is uh everyone ready ? Okay , we c we can hold on for a minute .
C :  Hello .
B :  .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Almost .
D :  Oh my gosh .
D : 
A :  I figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in .
C :  That's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive .
B :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Are you ready ?
A :  Okay , right , well , I take it that you are all ready now . Um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . Um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , and who we all are and stuff like that , mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on .
A :  Um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um
A :  now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a T_V_ remote and stuff and you guys have just been off doing some some uh R_ and D_ for that , that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , see I'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . Um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Do you have any preference uh of order ?
A :  Um I'd like to um hear o I'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh Catherine actually first . I want what I'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and
D :  Batteries .
C :  I think she is still finishing her .
B :  No no no no , it's fine I'm just preparing .
A :  It's just that yeah , let's let's hear from you first .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Okay . Where is that thing ? Oh sorry , couldn't see .
C :  Okay , it's uh
D :  It's here .
B :  Would that work ?
A :  Get yourself in position .
B :  Okay , so that's me again . Um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , if you remember that kind of which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v yeah , yeah . It wouldn't be very fancy . You can have a kinetic provision of energy , which is used on some watches these days . So if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . Or you can use solar cells , but I'm not sure about that indoors , really , but
D :  Ah .
A :  I don't think any of us remember the fifties .
C :  Is it like a crank thing or something .
D :  Mm .
C :  Well , there's sometimes combinations , I mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ?
D :  Mm .
B :  I dunno actually .
A :  Does anybody know ?
C :  Uh I think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but I don't know .
B :  I dunno .
B :  Um .
B :  Think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . And uh if we want something fancier , I think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , but I don't know if it's worth the cost . So we've got to discuss that .
A :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay , jolly good .
B :  For the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . You can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , if you know what I mean , so
A :  What's a double curved one ?
B :  You know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing .
B :  So
A :  Okay .
B :  Um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex ,
B :  uh rubber , wood , or titanium . And th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . And if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , so we just have to take that into account . But if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . And I think we discussed earlier on the R_ S_ I_ problem thing , so we could uh
A :  So that might be an idea of using the rubber , but then it should , you know yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Let's have a squeezable remote .
B :  Yeah . And also it doesn't break as easily maybe , I dunno
A :  when a T_V_ programme's got one watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . Yeah , I like that idea .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  So rubber would be
B :  Okay .
D :  I think rubber's
A :  Rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ? You think you can market that ?
D :  But after my after my fashion thing , I think you'll realise that rubber is more
A :  Ooh , we like rubber , ooh .
B :  Uh s so if d okay .
D :  People .
B :  And then there are the push-buttons , so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , um or you could have um L_C_D_ , which gives you a display .
B :  Um scroll buttons , as well .
A :  Uh-huh .
B :  So if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . So if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . Um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . So it's a constraint .
A :  Well , we're gonna go with I think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so
B :  Yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? If it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons .
B :  If that makes sense .
A :  push buttons instead of the wheel ?
B :  Yeah . .
C :  If it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , it doesn't matter if it's double I mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , I mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? Mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ?
A :  rubble double double .
B :  No , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing ,
A :  I'll have a Big Mac , please .
B :  then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . And that's we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . So if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . And I'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go I dunno why , but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons .
C :  Okay .
B :  So , either
B :  I dunno we just need to decide on the on the case .
A :  Let's have rubber push buttons , hey .
C :  Okay . Go rubber . Go rubber the whole way .
B :  Let's go crazy . And then , do I have a last slide ? Yes , I do . Um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . Um and the price that go with it with it , so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . Uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . If we get an advanced chip which is um used for the L_C_D_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Simple , yeah .
A :  Chip on print . It's a bit .
A :  Okay , uh what I'm not understanding here
B :  Mm .
A :  is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which I presume is like one P_C_B_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ?
B :  .
B :  Yeah .
B :  The infra-red .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Right . Um what a what alternatives do we have to that ?
A :  Y um what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ?
B :  Well , if if it's not chip on print then , I guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . It's less expensive mm
A :  so it sounds
B :  Technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too .
A :  So , why would we not go for that ? If it's something that's inside the the unit . I it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . Um we wanna go for an i i all so long as it works ,
B :  It doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah .
B :  Totally .
B :  Yeah .
B :  So let's not go for the
B :  Yeah , yeah . I agree .
A :  you know . So let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print .
B :  So it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons .
A :  Yeah .
A :  S yeah , push buttons .
D :  What about the just developed uh sample sensor ?
C :  I think push-buttons is
A :  What about what ?
D :  G there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing .
B :  Well
A :  Well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ?
D :  Mm , I dunno .
D :  Be cool . Channel two .
B :  It'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , I'm just guessing . But it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and
C :  Yeah .
C :  Th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh , 'cause uh
A :  Yeah . It's not something that we wanna t go into with this product .
C :  The yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , where , basically , you can program a sample wi um
C :  That when you say something it will give a response , and you program the response as well . Just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . So you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello Rick , or whatever . But , I mean , it's not it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the T_V_ on like , turn the T_V_ on , and i turns comes on , but it's not that . It just gives you a it just gives you a verbal response . So , yeah , I mean , like what's the point of saying , Hello remote , I mean , hello , how how are you ? Yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's
A :  Yeah .
B :  Hm .
D :  Oh , it just gives an answer .
D :  Oh , then then
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I thought I thought it was when they said
B :  Just if you are really lonely , maybe .
D :  I thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , channel five , and it will change . Like you talk to it . Can I have channel five ? Oh , then forget about it . Oh right okay .
B :  Channel five . And then it switches on .
C :  No , tha that w that w that would be more promising . It it's just a remote that talks to you . Uh . I mean to certain cues .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Okay , so I'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . So for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the
C :  'Kay .
C :  Yeah , I'm fine with the basic battery .
A :  Basic battery . It's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work .
D :  Mm .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Cheaper option . Are you happy with that ? Okay . So we'll go for the battery .
D :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  Then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ?
A :  We were go we were going with the late with the the R_S_I_ rubber , weren't we ?
C :  Yeah , so we want it rub rubber double curved .
A :  The the
D :  So it will look like something like this .
B :  Double ?
A :  The double whopper , please .
B :  Okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , and that's fine ?
A :  Yep , but we're going for the simple buttons .
C :  So rubber rubber keys , yeah .
A :  Yeah . And it's cheapest all round , it sounds kinda funky , and we can also market it as i 'cause we were s saying earl you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the R_ people were getting the complaining about R_S_I_ , and this is anti-R_S_I_ .
C :  Yeah .
D :  .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So that's another marketing point that we can use .
D :  Well the rubber push-buttons .
D :  Don't you have to move your
A :  But anything is gonna have buttons .
D :  Mm .
A :  Even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive .
B :  I thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a
A :  You
A :  You see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . It's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . It's not actually what you are doing .
B :  That they don't .
B :  Mm .
C :  .
A :  But the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-R_S_I_ ps specific
D :  Mm . Yeah , the rubber's good .
C :  Yeah . We're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , so they can sit there and go like
C :  Not that watching T_V_ should be that stressful .
A :  And you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah .
C :  Oh yeah , I guess T_V_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports .
B :  Alright , that's me done .
A :  Okay , Gabriel . Let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface .
C :  Alright .
C :  Alright .
C :  Yeah , some of what I have to say ties into what Catherine was just talking about .
A :  Great .
B :  Sorry .
C :  Okay , so I'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . And so basically I consulted with our manufacturing division . It sounded like Catherine was also speaking with them . Uh I also took uh Reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , 'cause I think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . Uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine .
A :  Mm .
C :  So I already mentioned the speech recognition interface . I guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . It's it's pointless .
A :  Mm .
C :  Uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . It would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the T_V_ . Uh so yeah , they they also give the uh they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an M_P_ three player like iPod . Um so we've already addressed that and I think that would actually be worse for something like R_S_I_ I mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . Um the other suggestion , and I I have a feeling that
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  That does get annoying .
C :  we're interested in in something more general , but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , like either gearing our remote towards kids , where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or , or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . But you know we can we can discuss this , but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . Uh um
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So , the key layout and design are really crucial . You don't want uh you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . And I didn't mention that we need a power button in our last I can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout
C :  from our manufacturing department . So this would be an example of bad layout , where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a V_ on both of them , so uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  it's sort of confusing for the user . Uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . And for something for kids .
A :  Do we have an uh example of a good one ?
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  Brilliant .
D :  Well
C :  Yeah . Um .
A :  Yeah .
C :  And so ,
C :  yeah , I th I think my personal preferences of we've all kind of talked about and seemed to be on the same page um . Uh so I was against the speech recognition and against going uh towards anything in in a niche sense . I think it should be more general . I didn't I didn't think the spinning-wheel or the uh L_C_ display were were crucial for us . And , yeah , that's it for me .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay . Well let's um so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? The um
A :  The the um the interface type we're going for
C :  So we're we're not gonna have any sort of display I think uh . So , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . Um .
A :  Just the simple s simple straight set of buttons .
C :  I think we shall have a limited number of buttons , ideally , I mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Uh .
C :  And some sort of it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . I guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , and we're not yeah . Are we gonna hav hav an are we d have we decided on whether
C :  Well now that we've decided on our
A :  w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , we're not we're just gonna go for something
C :  Um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , but um
A :  We're
D :  Maybe we can
C :  Yeah , I would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , like maybe the R_R_ can be yellow , or something like that .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Okey-dokey .
A :  Yeah , I don't have any other questions on this .
A :  Let's move over to
C :  I I guess the fact uh also that we are having a rubber case uh would prevent us from having the cover function that we thought of before . I mean , 'cause uh s so if we wanna have a lock of some sort it would have to be a button . But I think that should be I mean um , I can speak with the button department , but uh I think that it should be easy to have a button that just prevents prevents the other uh the other buttons from operating . So that should be simple .
A :  Yeah , sure .
A :  .
A :  Yeah , the button that just does that , yeah .
A :  Cool .
D :  Right .
D :  Well , I'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets
A :  Mm yeah .
D :  and what the fashions are for next year . Um .
D :  So yes , so from looking at this year's trends and fashions and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to which we've already probably discussed . Um the most important aspect is look and feel . So the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . So it has to be
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the T_V_ ?
D :  Yep .
C :  Mm .
D :  Exactly . Um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . So
C :  Yeah .
A :  What's that mean ?
D :  Technologically it should be like um work , basically , I guess . It should work .
C :  Well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , I mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market .
D :  Should
D :  That's new .
A :  Okay , now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Actually , I mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , 'cause our rubber one is not fancy I mean it's different , but I wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . If that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction . And it's it's not technologically innovative either .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So , no loose
A :  Maybe we could um
C :  Mm .
D :  That's why I was thinking , Bluetooth , 'cause if you like put up Bluetooth , and it's like a Bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , 'cause Bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , like people and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , they don't really care whether , you know ,
D :  at the end of the day whether it works properly or not .
A :  Of course , they do . One hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh I'm not gonna buy that , 'cause I dunno if it works or not .
D :  Well , they do , but it's like it's not
D :  Yeah , but it looks good . If it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration .
A :  Okay , well , what do you two think about this ?
C :  So is is the advantage of Bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other
D :  But like
C :  electronics ?
A :  Yeah , what I don't understand what m
D :  You could always insert , yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , right ?
A :  Yeah , and it this is just gonna all this is being used for is your television .
D :  Yeah , but , I mean , people like
A :  It would that would mean you'd need a television that has Bluetooth in it , which no no television does , does it ?
D :  Well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art .
B :  Well
A :  That would mean we'd have to make a television as well .
B :  Bluetooth would , for example , enable you , I think , to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now .
B :  Things like that .
A :  No , that would be your telephone in with your television .
B :  No i
C :  Yeah , the that wouldn't be the remote so much , I mean
A :  Yeah , and i
B :  No , but if you get Bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to
A :  Nah , the televi the television would have to be a Bluetooth compatible , basically . An and there is no there is no such thing .
B :  I with the television , yeah . I was just trying to find an advantage . Wha what w what advantage would you get for the
C :  Mm .
D :  Well , it doesn't
D :  Like it doesn't have to be , you know , Bluetooth , that was just an idea , but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . Whether it's a battery it could be something really
D :  really minor , you know , like but I think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . If we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have
A :  Okay .
D :  and um just go creative .
B :  Maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . It's been done for watches , but I haven't seen that for remotes , yet .
A :  Okay . Yeah , this that's that's very good .
D :  And then you can market it . Never have to change a battery again .
B :  Change the batteries ever again .
A :  And and this is all tying in very nicely . The fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . Th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it .
B :  Yeah , well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much .
C :  Yes , so can
D :  I think , safety s
A :  But yeah , by the squeezing it the
C :  Yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator .
A :  Yeah , that's a great idea . Well done .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use . And I think we've all um worked that out . Um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . Next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . So next year people will be buying , I found this really funny , you know , strawberry shaped chairs ,
C :  we're all about that .
C :  Okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them .
D :  and things .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Rubber things .
A :  I wanna watch the pineapple channel .
D :  Um and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , I would say is yeah , so we're in .
C :  .
A :  Well spongy , that's where . Yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there .
C :  Yeah , that's great for us .
D :  Yeah . And so personal what I was just saying like move away from the current remote controls uh like the look and the feel of the current ones and change the look and feel , while still keeping to the company's image , basically .
D :  So yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  .
D :  I had to say
D :  So we're moving in the right direction like
C :  Right .
A :  Alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , so through all that we've we go we're right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , that's great , using the spongy rubber that we were talking about that anti-R_S_I_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , and um I'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
C :  Yeah , that's great .
D :  Mm .
B :  No vegetables .
C :  Yeah , I don't know how we incorporate
A :  .
C :  We don't have to follow every trend , I guess .
D :  Maybe make it like fruity colours or something .
D :  Some sort .
C :  Uh-huh .
D :  Or
C :  The power button could be like a big apple or something .
D :  Mm .
B :  Well yeah , but Apple would sue you for that .
A :  Yeah , this is true .
C :  They don they don't own all images of apples .
B :  sued the Beatles so
C :  Okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate .
A :  Well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is
A :  its image .
C :  .
A :  Like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , or like are we going yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ?
D :  Well
D :  I think , if it's rubber
D :  it needs to be
A :  I mean you said earlier on i it should be funky .
D :  different . I think , it's it should be I mean , what do you associate with rubber ? You know like
A :  L keep it clean , keep it clean .
D :  really different colours basically . Okay , sor I sorry , I used the wrong word , what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? Um Um like I'm just thinking bright colours .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Bright natural colours , nothing
D :  too
A :  Bright , but not too bright .
D :  Bright , but too not yeah . Like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . Wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like
C :  Yeah .
A :  Like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ?
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah . And on the back of it have the logo .
A :  Okay , what ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  Sure .
B :  Why not ?
A :  Okay .
C :  The one thing I'm wondering about , I hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having I mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . I mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ?
A :  Yeah , I mean we that's we we
A :  Yeah .
A :  This is the remote control tomato .
D :  Well
D :  I can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool .
D :  Like and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , Mummy I wanna buy that one . And uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um
D :  like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . Especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . The only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but
A :  Well , it's it's gotta be chew proof .
D :  Yeah . So so it's rea it's quite it's quite like um user friendly and also for different families , like like family use as well , so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , I think . Especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something .
B :  I'm gonna write that down .
C : 
A :  So , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the
D :  Yeah .
B :  That's yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  So like you walk in , you're like , oh I like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? and then they go like , oh I can choose the colour wow . So it puts , I think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . So they also get to pick .
D :  Well , personally I like walking into a shop and choosing a colour .
C :  Yeah I mean , that that seems to work well with for products like iPod , where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing .
D :  It's um
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  Although I'd be curious to see how many uh
D :  D you've got the
B :  You know , there are some colours that I wouldn I would never choose , and I would be curious how many people choose that colour .
C :  Right .
A :  Well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And produce less of the silly colours , maybe .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay . Alright . Well um , we'll alright let's what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um
A :  is
A :  from you Catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design .
B :  Yep .
A :  Um Gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design . Then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . You won't be going off to your separate offices .
B :  Alright .
C :  Okay .
A :  Um and I think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay .
C :  Oh right .
A :  I think , yeah , it's gonna you know , come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . 'Cause at the moment , uh you know , it's it's hard . We were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's you know now we can actually start ,
B :  Mm .
B :  Cool .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It is .
A :  you know , s some sort of physical something or other .
C :  That sounds good .
A :  Um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation .
D :  Evaluation .
A :  Um .
A :  And I
A :  will be uh
A :  talking to the bosses , basically , and uh
A :  f fielding off some more spam and
B :  Great .
A :  that's it really .
A :  Keeping things t well , uh you know , ho hopefully uh keeping things together . Um .
A :  Yeah , that's
A :  This is this is uh good . So we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on . We definitely know how it's powered , we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons , we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down . It's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky . Don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff . People , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite ,
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  It's supposed to fix it rather than cause it . Um .
A :  you know , we're gonna we we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it , you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have ? We'll look into this lock key
C :  Right .
A :  facility , although whether or not it happens , or is possible , I don't know , but something to look into .
A :  Okay . I think that's um well done everybody .
C :  Alright .
A :  Anyone have any uh
A :  any questions , everyone know what they're doing ? 'Cause if you don't , you'll I'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm , I think we all know what we need to do now .
D :  This gives you all the details ?
A :  Okay . right well . It's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish .
C :  Okay .
A :  But um
A :  I got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together so bef before you all disappear off just
C :  Okay , I'll stay in here .
D :  um .
A :  hold hold fire . Um .
C :  Does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that
A :  Um I think , it's uh , yeah , I think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product .
C :  So we're buying fut I mean , we're getting futures in the company .
A :  Yeah , I think i I think that's I think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment .
C :  So we really have a incentive to make this remote work .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  I'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well .
A :  I want a share in the space rocket . Did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship .
C :  Yeah . .
D :  Yeah .
C :  This company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , we're definitely not in the money making department .
A :  .
C :  Well I I did notice looking at I mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the R_R_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I mean , if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious .
D :  Mm .
C :  R_R_ . Well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black .
A :  Mm .
B :  That's true .
A :  And the spaceship doesn't have the R_ have a massive R_ and R_ down the side of it but I still want one .
C :  No .
B :  Doesn't
C :  Mm .
A :  Okay . Um I've just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Right , well , I guess that's us .
A :  Yeah . It's not telling it's not saying do anything in particular just yet . So maybe you should go back to your own offices .
C :  Okay . Right .
B :  Are we taking these off ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it says you two
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  I g yeah .
A :  Time is it ?
D :  Fourteen twenty six .
A :  Okay . Lovely to see you all again . Um it's our conceptual design meeting and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five and so we have forty minutes for this one again and so we'll go just after three o'clock . Um okay our agenda , we're gonna do an opening , I'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , then we'll have your three presentations um and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , and finally we'll close .
A :  So opening . Um these are our minutes from r the functional design . We decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , because we have international appeal and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . Our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . And s um in specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station .
B :  Okay .
A :  Okay , now three presentations . I'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching .
B :  That would be me .
C :  Yep .
B :  Alright .
B :  Well .
A :  Mm . 'kay .
A :  Function F_ eight it . There we go .
B :  Alright .
B :  Um I'm very excited by this one actually guys I uh had a lot of fun doing it . Components design . This is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control and what should we make our specific remote control out of .
B :  Um . So , we need to examine each element separately , but we're designing a full thing , so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . The main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . These are all things that we had sort of addressed before , but I'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here as we figure out what they should be made of and what they should look like .
B :  The case , uh the options that I've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . I haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , just keep that in mind , but these are the options that we have from manufacturing and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic .
B :  That would be our case . Um buttons , for buttons we have um pushbuttons , which is what Real Reaction uses the most often , but we also have scror scroll wheels , which can have integrated pushbuttons , or we could go all high-tech and have an L_ L_C_D_ screen . Um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , depending on what our other needs are . And then battery I think is where things get most exciting . We're talking about long-life batteries here . Um we can we can have your sort of basic double A_ batteries , but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery , like are used in high-tech watches , where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up .
A :  Mm .
B :  Um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . Or a solar battery , although there are slight um complications with solar batteries as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . Not quite sure what that is , but that's the description that I received , so that's what I'm passing on to you . So those are our options .
B :  Um personal preferences that I was thinking through here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . So if we're going for fashion in our cases , I think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . Maybe titanium , maybe some wood . We're gonna have to investigate that better when I get specifics of the actual materials , but that's sort of what I have in mind . And we wanna go for simplicity . Probably pushbuttons , but I'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything
A :  Mm .
B :  any ideas on that ? I mean I know the iPods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons which are exactly like what they're describing , so that might be something we wanna look into . And I'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . Solar I don't think would be such a good idea , because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . But this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , I think that that m would be a very interesting thing . But I think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip to keep our costs down . Uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an L_C_D_ . So I think we want to be aware of not making things overly t
B :  technological if they don't need to be , 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . That's what I have for options . Um I'd appreciate anyone's input , but that's what I'm seeing for the future of the the look of this thing .
D :  Is double-curved like would be like two hands kind of thing ?
B :  I'm not sure . I haven't received any specific
D :  Okay . 'Cause I'm imagining like double-curved is like , you know , like two sides that curve and then like one curve would just be like a single vertical-ish kind of looking thing , but I've no idea .
B :  visuals of this yet .
B :  This is what I'm sort of
B :  Yeah . I'm not sure , but I'll let you know as soon as I get any pictures .
D :  Sounds good .
A :  Yeah , I wonder
B :  I know if we do have a double-curved case , it can't have any titanium in it .
B :  But the titanium , they were quite they're marketing quite hard to us as being used in the space programme , so that could be quite interesting . Space-age remote .
C : 
A :  Mm-hmm . Just an interesting marketing kind of element .
B :  Just all things to keep in mind . Yeah .
B :  That's about all I have to do , guys . I hope I didn't go through that too quickly .
A :  Uh just a real quick question um the weight of these different elements , have you no idea , okay .
B :  Yeah , n no idea , no idea .
B :  I'm assuming
B :  that a kinetic battery isn't gonna take up that much weight , and that a tita titanium is very light , I know , um but other than that's really basic , I mean , that's all I have gotten so far . Alright ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  Any other questions ?
C :  Uh-huh . Don't think so .
B :  No ? Okay .
B :  I have save this in the uh shared projects , if anyone wants to look and I have c considerable notes on the topic as well , if anyone needs any more information . Uh
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Thank you , perfect .
D :  Thanks .
A :  Um if you made notes yourself you can put those on our um underneath our oh , uh in your book , then don't worry about that .
B :  Just in my notebook , but if anyone has any specific questions , don't hesitate to email me or something .
B :  Alright ? Uh I guess I can
A :  'Kay now we're um concepts concepts of user interface .
A :  Yeah , um . This one's so much tighter than the other one .
B :  I know .
A :  Okay . Nope .
A :  There we go . Here you are .
C :  Jess .
B :  G oh , geez .
C :  Alright , so I'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device .
C :  Um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . We want it to be simple and we want it to be fashionable .
C :  other we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . Uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are and make sure that we include that we've included all of those and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people .
C :  We have a number of different choices for a design concept um and s that's that's something that that I'll show you some examples of um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , how how what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . Uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . And of course we also have to make it look cool .
C :  So basically , that's what we don't want . M we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . We want something that looks nice and simple .
C :  Here's a a fairly simple device . This is an an iPod from Apple . Um I think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . It's very minimalistic in its design . Uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small L_C_D_ screen . Um the thing I like about this is that
B :  Hmm .
C :  it's very very quick to access the main features . Uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause . They're the main the main features of the iPod , the things you will use a all the time . Um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the L_C_D_ screen and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . So I think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . Um
C :  here's a another example . This is uh it's an interesting idea and I think i it looks pretty cool . Um it's certainly got novelty value . Uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . Uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . The buttons are are different shapes and and you can sort of yeah if you're watching T_V_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which and basically , yeah it's ith it's fun .
A :  Mm .
C :  So I I like I like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . So you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . I mean most people , when they watch T_V_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their T_V_ and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . So , you have buttons for your favourite channel , changing the volume , which is something you do all the time when you're watching T_V_ , and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored .
C :  Um other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the T_V_ , uh I don't know what else you do with a T_V_ . Um but these are these are all necessary functions . Uh you can't have a t there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , so we need to find a way of including these somehow . Um and one other suggestions I'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the iPod .
C :  So we'd either have a small L_C_D_ display on the device itself , or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television and can b be controlled through the device . And that would allow you to access access the advanced features uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  So you'd be advocating an L_C_D_ then ?
C :  I think that's that's one way to go , yes . Um I mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an L_C_D_ display , it's it's nice , because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair .
B :  Okay .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  There are disadvantages , an an L_C_D_ display would have to be quite small , 'cause we're we're I well we're I assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . Um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , 'cause you ten you tend to watch T_V_ in the dark , but you need to be able to see your L_D_D_ L_C_D_ display .
B :  Right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right .
C :  The alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . Uh
C :  a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes where you you press the buttons and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . I mean that that's also a good idea . It's it can it does have it's problems as well , if you've got a small T_V_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make .
B :  'Kay .
A :  I do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . Um and so like favourite channels is is applicable , but I think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . Like I I know I use that often enough .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well
B :  Are you are you tak
C :  Yeah .
D :  Wait , but is that separate from what he was saying ?
B :  Yeah .
A :  Well if it if it was a L_ L_C_D_ on th on the remote , I don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a
B :  No , I think I think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the V_C_R_ or something if I've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , that that would be one of the features , yes .
A :  Okay . 'Cause that would be more specifically a digital box , mm-hmm .
C :  But it's it's it's something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control
C :  the c uh communication is one way , so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least I don't think you can . Um I'm not sure .
B :  Oh , good point .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , now we're moving on to market . Marketing .
D :  Should I plug that in ?
C :  Is that going on ? Okay .
D :  Maybe it's just not Is it on ?
C :  Uh that should be alright , actually .
D :  Ri What F_ do you have to press , five ?
A :  Eight .
D :  I just keep pressing lots of 'em .
D :  Well , I don't know how relevant all of this gonna be . If anything , the that they gave me . Alright .
A :  Oops , it's not plugged in , quite in well enough .
B :  No signal .
A :  There we are .
B :  Oop , there we go .
A :  Mm 'kay .
D :  Oh yeah .
D :  Okay , so we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching . Basically , I was given um an executive summary that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , and then also some fashion watchers in Paris and Milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . So first um they had people they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls , and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , so that just goes back to
D :  the whole desire of our c Real Reaction company wanting to focus on fashion and so , even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . And as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , which is doubly important to the third one , so just to take that weight into account .
B :  Okay .
D :  The second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . That would be like if we use something like the space material or the L_C_D_ screen , things like that . And then ease of use was the third most important , whi so really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . I don't know how much we agree with that . And then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , tight material . And so that brings us to my personal preferences . Who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding . Personally , I don't really think that I want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so
A :  S sweet .
D :  even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , I don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away . Also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by Real Reaction , I'm a little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . Personally , like I might reverse it , but if we're working for this company then I guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . But it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material .
B :  Mm .
B :  That there's all kinds of scope for imagination in that one though .
D :  Yeah . I don't have a lot of notes to share if you want them , that pretty much sums it up . So yeah .
A :  Okay , do we have any s some questions for this , let's see um .
D :  Yeah , what can I possibly enlighten on ?
A :  Um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? Um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? Like could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? It would be easier on the hands .
B :  If it's latex if it's latexy
A :  It's kind of and then it we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , I dunno . But
B :  Um , mean
C :  A kind of thing that
B :  An uh I if th my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , but that it's covered with the latex , which is spongier and softer on your hands .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It's there's something to be said , I mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to
B :  R_ R_ repetitive stress injuries and things and and
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , something grippable , I mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , so something , m m instead of a necess yeah , grip , I'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , you know , i and I think I'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time , like I'm imagining that sort of thing , I don't know what th that material's called .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , I think that given the list of materials I w I was forwarded it's that seems doable .
B :  could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? We could colour-co-ordinate them , li
A :  F for sure , or maybe like
A :  um couple main ones being like , I dunno , lemons or strawberries or something .
B :  The buttons could be fruit-shaped . Oh well it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot isn't it ? Or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits .
A :  Could they be smelly ?
C :  I Is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? Uh like uh I dunno , like uh carrots or something .
D :  Oh God .
A :  I don't know .
A :  Or carrot shaped , mm .
C :  Maybe , or
A :  Like large button , that's what I was thinking of , yeah .
D :  What about the idea of like a round remote ? Instead of like a vertical up and down one . Like in terms of holding it . Like that's a f shape of a fruit . Just to tie it in a little .
C :  Kind of like a potato .
B :  be yeah . It'd be harder to f bu uh buttons I think . It'd be harder to press button .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Might would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it ? 'Cause I think the reason they're long is yeah .
C :  Depends . When you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ?
A :  Harder to push .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Or your fingers ?
B :  Um
A :  I usually hold it in one hand . Maybe
C :  Or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , so you you hold it in one hand , and you press the buttons with your thumb .
B :  I
A :  But then the buttons would have to be very small . Don't you think ?
B :  Yeah , that's ts how I tend to do it .
D :  Yeah , 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around . But I like i
B :  No just thumb-sized . Jus
A :  But I mean in order to get to all of them , you know .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  They would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other .
C :  Maybe . But if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps .
B :  That's true .
B :  Right .
B :  I When I'm when I'm pressing buttons on my iPod , that's how I do it , hold it and press the four . Yeah .
C :  So you hold it in one hand and you press you press the buttons with your thumb and
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , or in and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I love the idea of the wheel like the iPod . 'Cause th
C :  And you find that works quite well ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Is that The button on an iPod , is it what is it , is it just four buttons or is it li more like a scroll thing ?
D :  It's like five , 'cause there's one in the middle .
A :  It's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel .
B :  It wel well yeah , it would I mean each version of it has been a little bit different , but
A :  The one I have doesn't have the four on i like around it , I don't think .
B :  Oh yeah , you had one of the in-between ones , when they weren't doing that anymore .
B :  Ts and you press the centre button , that's that's your all-purpose select button right there .
C :  Right .
C :  Oh , I see , right , yeah . Oh , okay . Yeah , that's quite a good design .
B :  Since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , yeah .
D :  I think why it would be good for us is 'cause like you could have the same wheel sort of effect for like channel flipping and then the other one could be like for volume . Like just the idea of like those so few buttons for main things , but then how you could go back to the menu and like , I dunno if we would want it on the screen there or on the actual T_V_ . I kind of am wanting to say on the T_V_ , 'cause if you're changing the brightness , don't you wanna see it happening , kind of ? And then you could still have that available .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh uh t
B :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I think an L_C_D_ screen might be good in theory , but not as useful in practice .
C :  I think it could be difficult in practice , yeah . Also z yeah , 'cause you would be z looking down at the L_C_D_ screen , than back up at your T_V_ and people don't wanna do that .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm . Mm-hmm .
B :  Right .
B :  Um
A :  Okay um we have we've about fifteen minutes left , so I'm I'm gonna
B :  Oh we probably have to get going , don't we ?
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  continue with my pres presentation . Um I've one more slide before we close , but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , so I'll just bring that up and show you all
B :  'Kay .
A :  before we move on . Um
D :  If I get any more information of fruits and vegetables , I'll let you know .
B :  Could
B :  Could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? In different fruit and vegetable colours , yeah .
C :  Like , to make it different fruits .
C :  Yeah , it's possible .
A :  Yeah , and then like the the covers could be spongy latex wherea but the actual model could be titanium .
B :  Exactly .
B :  And you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever . All these options .
C :  I think maybe th the packaging , it should be like a lemon and the the packaging is like the peel . So instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , and the remote control's inside .
B :  Ooh .
D :  Well , there we go . The iPod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun . It's like the way it all comes all cute .
A :  Ah hmm hmm hmm .
B :  Oh .
C :  Don't know .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Options .
D :  Lemons ?
A :  Okay , um components concept . Energy , chip on print .
B :  Uh-hu oh , oh yes . Right , I had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get
B :  be necessary but um
A :  That's th th this is the agenda they gave me . So can you just explain what that is real quick ?
B :  Alright , so um decisions , what the okay deci decisions on energy I'm thinking is based on the battery . Um I dunno , what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think it's awesome . I think it's really cool .
B :  Am I
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I mean , it would
D :  t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , um I think it's good , as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , but as far as I know , the technology is good .
B :  Right , I haven't gotten any yeah , any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , I think .
D :  Costs .
D :  But over time
B :  Um circuit boards .
B :  Um yeah , I got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . They're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , and di I think they're quite easily printed on by machine , which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . I don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . I wasn't really given any options , I was just given that this is how they're done .
A :  Okay .
B :  yeah , I can't can't really tell you . I can I can tell you a whole lot about how it works . But I don't know any decisions on
A :  If they're if they're really options .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I'm sorry , I did f
C :  Al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , I think . Uh it's fairly fairly standard .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Um okay , then we'll move on to the case .
A :  Um oh bu I guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe .
B :  Right . Well okay , here's the here's the thing on the chips that I that I got . Um simple , regular , advanced chip on print . The chip on print includes an infrared sensor , so we don't have to worry about that .
B :  Um ,
B :  'kay , the pushbutton if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , and an L_C_D_ requires advanced . Do we want a scroll wheel , or do we just want pushbuttons ?
C :  I don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . I mean it might be nice for changing the volume . Uh but
B :  Oh .
A :  It would be nice for changing the volume , but I don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . 'Cause you don't have control over numbers or
C :  I don't think it would really work .
D :  Yeah , it's a
B :  Yeah , th it'd be it'd be handy for going through if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll .
C :  Yeah , you really need buttons for changing a channel .
D :  But if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  We have five minutes left for the meeting , so .
D :  and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as I'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . And otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out and th no it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
A :  So , have a scroll for volume ?
B :  F or for all those secret functions ?
B :  When you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus .
C :  I think yeah , I think a scroll wheel would be nice , but it's not necessary . Um
B :  Right . So we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending and maybe we could table that decision for later .
A :  Um .
B :  I don't know .
A :  I think w well I think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not .
B :  Okay .
B :  Well , let's think about that while we talk about the case .
A :  Okay , let's do case .
B :  Uh I'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I'm a little um I'm a little hesitant about it , because I'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside .
B :  Okay .
A :  Um
D :  Oh could it be hard , and then something around it ?
B :  Uh yeah , everything I've
A :  Yeah , I would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing .
B :  N oh wha what I've what I've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . Not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . The inside is hard . I don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , I think that that's done for us .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Ge o
A :  Okay . So we uh we do want latex .
C :  'Kay . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Latex . Um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Fruity colours . Okay um let's go to the ufe user interface then we'll come back to the chip I suppose .
B :  Oh and we want a curved case , yeah ? Or a double-curved ?
A :  Well , we don't really know what the difference is , right ?
D :  I'm thinking curved of some sort .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , okay . We don't really know what the difference
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um okay , interface , the type and the supplements .
A :  So push or scroll , right ? Or both ?
C :  Um
C :  Yep . Um
C :  And I think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , 'cause then we can have a a simple chip and it's simpler , it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . So in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons .
B :  Good point .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . I think that yeah . For channel surfing I think a scroll an actual like an iPod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , I dunno .
C :  Yeah , yeah , it's uh it's it's fairly simple .
B :  Yeah . I say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information but I have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , but it's gotta be some more expensive , so I think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Is that okay with you ? How you feeling ?
C :  Yeah . Interesting .
B :  because
D :  Yeah . And let's like see if we get anything else . I mean I'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , it's more just to give it a different kind of look , but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It might be cool enough .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , and then supplements , how are we gonna do that ?
C :  Yep .
C :  Uh what do you mean by supplements , exactly ?
A :  Um I assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use .
C :  Um
B :  Oh .
A :  So we're gonna have like a menu button , so that we can access on-screen things then ? Okay , um so we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through .
C :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Alright .
C :  Um in
B :  So what are what are our buttons gonna be ? On off
C :  Yeah .
C :  On off , uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . Yeah , yeah about yeah like yeah , a bit like radio presets . Um
B :  So like one through five , or
D :  Like a radio type sorta situation ?
A :  Pre-set channels and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero , right ?
C :  Uh we wouldn't even need the numbers .
B :  No .
C :  I think maybe numbers seems is kind of old-fashioned .
A :  Well , but in order to pre-set a cha oh I guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through .
C :  Yeah , yeah , you can just and you need some kind of , I dunno , sort of up down kind of button , but the volume control could double for that , for example .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , up down .
A :  Mm-hmm . Okay , um finishing the meeting now . Um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . You'll get specific instructions from your personal coach .
C :  Cool .
B :  Ooh .
D :  Wow .
A :  Um did we decide on a chip ? Let's go with a simple chip ? Okay .
B :  Simple chip .
C :  Yep .
A :  We are done . Thank you everyone .
A :  Oh I di these are already in our shared folder , so .
B :  Okay , cool .
C :  Clay . I wasn't expecting that .
B :  Clay .
D :  That went well , thank you .
A :  That's great .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Perfect .
A :  Alright , let me just PowerPoint this up .
A : 
A :  Right so um this meeting will be about the conceptual design , don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , it's just something important that we need to do . Um , think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . In this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype .
A :  Um . Right so um , apologies for the last meeting , it was brought to my attention that I did not make the roles clear enough , um , so I will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . Um , fair enough , thanks for the input , 's always good . Um .
A :  So , basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , um , and gonna go through you , uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . And then we'll make some more decisions on um basic uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . So , perfect . So , without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to . Alright Nathan , take it away .
B :  I'll go first .
D :  Go ahead .
A :  It is Nathan right ? I'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? Good .
B :  No Nathan's fine . It's either Nathan or participant two .
C :  Mister participant two that is .
B :  Uh .
D :  Nice .
B :  Okay . Um , basically what I'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do because of what our manufacturer offers , so Basically what I'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that .
A :  Nice .
A :  Mm .
B :  Um , components of a remote control , okay . We've already kind of gone over this but we're gonna have to get into more detail and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon .
B :  Energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . Our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium so we might have to look if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . Um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . Basically , it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . So that's one possibility but I don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . So we'll have to look into that .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . Um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , which we probably don't wanna do , curved or very sexy double curved .
A :  What kind of th thickness are we looking at ?
B :  Um , I imagine that we could specify . Um , I don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of
B :  three or four millimetres . Yeah .
A :  Okay , brilliant .
B :  Um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , but to use those we'd have to use more chips , um and that would cost us more . And if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . Um and just a little note there , touch screen equals many chips which equals many Euro .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Right .
D :  Right . Nice .
B :  Um , one thing that I noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . So you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it but in fact there is light coming out of the remote and you know the television can detect that . And if you were to record if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light .
B :  Uh one thing that I thought might be interesting was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . So you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . Course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Interesting .
A :  M Maybe is there an option that we can have that off or on so a person can select like
D :  Mm . Good call .
B :  Yeah . I am sure that we could do that . Um , of course
D :  Choose it .
A :  Yeah I like the idea , it's a good idea .
B :  Yeah , just as a fun gimmick .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Just to set us apart a little bit . Um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . Uh , we really don't have any way around the T_A_ one one eight three five . Um findings , okay , we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies or should we just make do with what we have available ?
C :  Interesting question .
B :  'S a bit of a challenge question .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yes .
D :  Well I'd say shop around but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ?
A :  Mm .
B :  Right , that's my concern too .
B :  Um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . My personal preference is I'll just throw my cards on the table , uh I think we should probably go the solar battery route , just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . Uh , I like the idea of the visible light signalling , that's something to set us apart and uh I was thinking about I was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes .
B :  So we're not so confined by one style and say some you know , say our the one if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation .
D :  Right .
A :  Mm . Can we do marketing piloting too ? Try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ?
D :  Right .
D :  Um
D :  It's an option , uh but actually there's I've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now which actually might even come into play beforehand , it may help us decide for now . Temporarily anyway .
A :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Okay , perfect . Great , thank you very much Nathan . That's perfect , so I guess that makes sense for you to take it from here .
B :  Oh yeah , you're welcome .
D :  I guess so , 'cause I found some interesting things .
C :  Did you ?
D :  You waiting for me ? I know , what a teaser ain't it . Um . Right .
A :  Fascinating , compelling even .
D :  So current market trends .
D :  Screen . Um , basically I was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now and what's going on in other design fields , to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . Um , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , um that we need innovative design options and there needs to be an easy user interface . Um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing .
D :  Now I'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , but I think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean ,
B :  Mm .
D :  v line thing may be something we can look into . Different skin options , or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , like you could choose your menu bullets to be
A :  Tomatoes .
D :  a different shape or okay , not the example I would choose , but you know what I mean to t sort of and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , uh not something I I've come up with a though if we can get around to getting piloting , I thought maybe a casing option like uh
B :  Mm .
C :  I like it , I like it .
D :  not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something
B :  Hmm .
B :  I should have mentioned this um . As far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , it has a consistency of those stress balls .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yes .
D :  Mm . Might be an interesting way to go .
A :  Slick , slick .
C :  Fabulous .
D :  Um , yeah so something to sit on for now . So overall I think we should stick with what we're finding , everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new I think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now .
B :  Mm .
D :  Um .
A :  Interface , oh the interface graphics for the um
D :  Yeah . Um . Well I d but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I like the idea of of rubber too because it's tends to be associated with being durable , something that you can drop and it doesn't matter . 'Cause so many you go to so many houses these days and you see broken remote controls .
A :  Mm .
D :  True .
D :  Very true . Very true . Very much so . Um
A :  Yeah , it's like , yep it's ubiquitous isn't it ?
B :  Taped with duck tape and what have you , you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber .
C :  We can have a duck tape casing .
D :  We could . I think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , but worth a shot .
C :  It could go with the granola crowd .
D :  Ah , it could be , it could be , um . Yeah that's what I know .
A :  Great , thanks for that Sarah . Ron ?
D :  No problem .
C :  Phew .
C :  Computer's adjusting . One moment please . So interme interface concept by your faithful user interface designer .
C :  So yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . Uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . Here's a d series of different remote controls that are out on the market today . I think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look . Um , so
A :  Yeah .
C :  the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . Uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team but uh I'll get to that in a moment . Um , so current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , um and basically you record your own verbal labels c and connect them to the remote control . Now our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses . Like you could say good morning uh remote control and it'll say in a sexy female voice , Good morning Joe . Um .
C :  In fact we already have this for a coffee maker line
D :  Mm .
A :  Lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team at the
C :  On the remote control right .
D :  Yeah . Very true , very true .
C :  Um , another concept is what uh Apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh L_C_ display like on the uh iPod which I am sure most of you know about . Um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , I don't think that's we're necessarily going for . And uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming but uh I again if we go with touch screen I don't think that's a big issue . Um
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
B :  No .
C :  and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose .
A :  Yeah , I can see .
C :  Um , again probably not what we're going for so I I mean my ideas here and kind of where I think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular iPod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing although I think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . Uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package to kind of set the idea that you can change it and you can try changing it and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one which can add value to our uh bottom line .
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm , right .
C :  Uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . Um , and of course our voice command system which I've talked a little bit about already and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around so
A :  Mm .
C :  red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . And uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that I got from my bank
D :  Mm .
C :  has jokes when it's ready .
D :  Nice .
A :  Great .
C :  And uh that is about it .
A :  Great , wonderful Ron , cool . Lot of good ideas , good facts to have .
D :  Mm .
A :  That's what they need , it's like a little dongle it just sticks up this further so you don't have to stand up every time , just connect it , my kingdom . Right so , good to know all that stuff , thanks guys , um . Now we kind of have to come to some decisions , um , I figure we can just go down the line and all three of us can have a chat about it . Um .
D :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Based on what Nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um I think , I dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ?
D :  I think it's our most marketable feature just because it's so new and it's something that is showing up in other places .
A :  'Kay .
D :  But can we really afford it 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then right ?
A :  'Kay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  My estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty Euro per remote , yeah that's just an estimate though .
A :  To produce each one .
D :  Per ?
D :  Piece .
C :  Oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects .
D :  I know
A :  Mm .
C :  You industrial designers .
B :  I know . It's fun .
A :  Hmm .
D :  And our goal was to be under twelve fifty or we have to be under twelve fifty ? Do we remember ?
A :  Well .
B :  I thought there was some flexibility with that .
D :  Okay .
A :  There is , it's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . Um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five . If you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five .
D :  Can we justify it ?
D :  Right .
A :  So
C :  Where do you guys come up with these numbers ?
B :  That's just off the top of my head , it is pending further emails .
D : 
A :  From the board , um , well
B :  Right .
D :  Though I think that's what people would pay for , I mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something
A :  That's true , I mean
B :  It is the new it would be in a class of its own .
D :  Yeah .
A :  And that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , we're gonna make I mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , we just couldn't , not for twenty-five Euros , so
D :  Right .
A :  we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , but that's something that we can have finance deal with . Um , I say that we provisionally go with the touch screen or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter Ron ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  I'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea and I also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh
D :  See if we can cut some corners .
D :  Right . Well and we can look into this other manufacturing option , and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It's true . We could initially go with what we have and if we can find them cheaper later on
D :  Right .
D :  It's a starting point anyway , so .
A :  No we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , there's always the opportunity , if it's gonna be about the size of the iPod or whatever , you know , w we yeah , I guess we can play around with it a bit . Alright , let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here .
D :  Mm .
A :  So
C :  I mean I think that we really have two main selling points , I think that our casing and the voice recognition
D :  Yeah 'cause with voice recognition
D :  I mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote .
A :  The voice rec thing , I mean , if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , I think we might have to drop the voice rec .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely .
A :  Yeah .
C :  To be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , I mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice we're using it for our coffee machines already .
D :  Price-wise .
D :  True . We've already got it .
C :  I can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall . Sounds good .
A :  Hmm . What do you think on it Nathan ? About the voice rec ?
B :  I think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up um but it does put it into it'd become the Rolls Royce of remote controls basically . It would be very nice .
D :  Pretty much .
C :  I mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say .
D :  Right and they said they wanted voice recognition . Course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell
D :  is a call I don't think I can give the highs ups . Like really I can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know .
A :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Does having both really up our costs ?
A :  I can't see how it wouldn't , I mean , there's you know the old aphorism , you can have it fast , you can have it cheap or you can have it quality , pick two of three . You know , you can't you can't have all three . It's just impossible .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well if we're gonna pick betwe e alright so we have to pick between one of the two . Um .
A :  Otherwise , yeah , we just it just becomes cost prohibitive . What which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ?
D :  Well , we already have research backing voice recognition as you know
D :  fiscally solvent . But uh I I I personally would tend to another direction but if that's what's gonna sell I think that's what we need to go with and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model .
B :  I would have to side with that , I think the voice recognition is simpler , we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , it's
A :  'Kay .
A :  What does the cost look like Ron ? Is it cheaper to do the V_R_ or to do the uh touch screen ?
C :  Well my p is
A :  Nathan ?
D :  Mm .
B :  Um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , but I think the voice recognition would they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition we're not gonna have to do as much design work and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what I mean .
A :  Mm .
D :  Right .
A :  Right .
D :  Right .
C :  Um , I definitely have to agree with that last comment .
D :  And we're still not then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , we can stick with what we've already got .
A :  Mm .
D :  In a lot other ways too .
A :  Okay . So I'm getting alright so more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . Okay . Yeah .
D :  I think it's our lower risk option which for right now we can have it on the market sooner which is all in all our best option .
A :  Okay . Sorted . We will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition .
C :  It's you and me outside a little here .
D :  So and when are we gonna have basic prototypes coming up next that's you guys's next step right ?
A :  Yeah , well we'll we'll sic we'll sort out what it what f what else we're gonna talk about for the prototype but yeah that's our next step , it'll be a developing of prototype .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
D :  Okay .
B :  Are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ? Okay .
A :  Yes .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  We'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um . You discussed either a lithium or a solar power . Would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? Or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ?
B :  Um , the solar power definitely would be but I think just to keep people from getting annoyed , 'cause sometimes solar power fails and there's no way round that , we should install a small backup battery .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to
D :  Well what of people with like the T_V_ in their basement , like what if wha we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere so having a secondary source is probably
A :  Mm . Yep .
B :  It's true . Yeah , it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , and you know how those those don't really require that much light , um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . Doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything .
C :  Calculator .
D :  Yeah . True . True .
D :  Right .
A :  Right .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . What do you think Ron ?
C :  I'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . Uh I have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . If we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control and maybe kind of have a round remote control that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh
A :  Hmm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Interesting .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? What's the uh idea ?
C :  Just a thought .
C :  Well if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point .
D :  I if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition or is it just something that they do sometimes .
D :  True , and i probabl I think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , right .
A :  Well we have to have buttons on it too as well . But that's done , that's no bother I mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have or like um who is it , Apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass and you know and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers . I mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , it could still have the basic buttons on it . Um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right .
D :  Yep .
D :  Yeah .
D :  With the bu yeah .
A :  And maybe a menu button and so forth , you know um use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever you know I mean we can sort that out .
B :  I think , I think you're on to something because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . Maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good , even though and hand-held the same time .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  True .
D :  Way to go .
C :  I think it's all about following Apple's lead on a lot of these things .
D :  Yeah I'm thinking of the airport portal , you know like that little pod looking thing ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , those are nice .
C :  Exactly .
A :  Yeah , I mean a nice although we do um wh uh is I'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing and get back to it but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um
D :  Right .
B :  Mm .
D :  That would be kinda neat .
D :  Terracotta bowl or something .
A :  Still , I mean , yeah , along those lines . Yeah I like that , I like that idea a lot . Um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . And the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel , um you know li lik if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit . You know something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it .
D :  Mm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
B :  Just kind of the squishy feel .
D :  Yeah , which is the next big thing , so that's not gonna hurt us either .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Yeah let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . But to be fair , yeah , I mean , you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up .
D :  Right .
A :  Yeah I like it , I like the idea , that's good . Um and we've sorted of discussed costs , um . I guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um .
D :  Handy .
B :  Sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , I just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers and I'm just having to guess .
D :  Okay .
A :  We'll have more of an idea when the prototype
A :  have more of a we'll have more of an idea later on . Um . And we just yeah go from there . Um , so we've revisited the touch screen and more or less ruled that out , um , I think so we're more or less con we wh wh we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex .
D :  Mm .
D :  Right . Well when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , although I'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , like those shouldn't be
B :  Right .
A :  Like maybe have menu things .
D :  Take precedence , yeah .
B :  If , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things .
D :  Right .
A :  Mm .
D :  And they slide .
A :  Yes .
D :  Well and do we wanna consider like an iPod screen which isn't a touch screen but you're still scrolling through menu options , in p
C :  Think then we're hitting our cost issue again .
D :  True , we're still not making it easier then .
A :  Yeah we've also got the the me the thing of , if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we yeah . B But no I mean we could do a slide or a compartment , you know , like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . Or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um like on a D_V_D_ player . You know you see the modern D_V_D_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that .
B :  Yeah .
D :  True .
D :  Fair enough .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah it's just a scroll .
B :  Right .
D :  Yeah .
B :  So are we gonna are we talking we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , are we going to use scroll buttons ? Rubber buttons ? Um
A :  Well it seems like I dunno it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case we might as well stick with that um .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Probably .
B :  Right .
C :  I think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command .
D :  Right .
D :  Mm .
D :  Well no it's basic just like four directions that are that can use as menu or channel and volume or however you wanna do it , are really versatile and everybody's already got them to some extent on the remotes they already own so it's not like we're dealing with everybody relearning things 'cause that's not something anybody's gonna wanna buy a new for .
B :  Right .
A :  Mm 'kay , um .
A :  We've already kind of covered this as well . That seems to be selling um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um . Especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population .
D :  Mm .
D :  Right , particularly in technological fields , so that's exactly where we're headed .
A :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Um .
A :  Yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover I think fi an an any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype .
C :  Well what are we actually doing ? What were
A :  Right . I was just gonna step on to um I wasn't ? Oh , my bad um sorry . The um , yeah okay I was just gonna assign tasks in the next b anyth any oth any other final thoughts before we go ahead and cool ?
D :  Uh .
D :  Oh it wasn't in the way but yeah , whatever .
D :  No , don't worry about it .
C :  Sure .
D :  Okay .
B :  So have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? Or are we just going to go with one ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um .
B :  ..It's very , it's very hard thing to predict because you have different cases and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well mm . It's a tough situation , but obviously having more cases also costs more so
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  Well then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , I don't know , olive green or something . That wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing .
B :  There's an idea .
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  And again copying iMac's kind of for iPod Mac Apple's uh colour scheme .
D :  Yeah , get in there .
D :  Yeah , totally .
A :  Yeah , I think that's probably a good id okay so let's work on uh multiple case colours .
A :  But yeah , stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design .
A :  Cool .
A :  Alright , so we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . I want the uh I'd like Nathan , I'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . Um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . And um Ron if you can
B :  Right .
A :  figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . Somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place .
A :  Um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . Um I need you guys to work together on making a prototype , um using um prototype building materials um . And also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . So that's what to start with for now , is that alright , you guys feel clear about this ?
B :  Oh excellent yeah .
D :  Cool .
B :  That sounds good .
C :  Fabulous .
A :  Alright . I guess we'll just hit the bricks . Thanks guys .
D :  Cool .
A :  Okay . Hi Team . Hope you had a good lunch . Okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting . Um let's get started .
A :  'Kay , here is the agenda for today's meeting . Um we're gonna open it and I'm gonna keep the minutes as Project Manager . We're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you again . And then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts and then we're gonna close it up . And we have forty minutes again .
A :  'Kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control .
A :  Okay . Let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . Who would like to go first ?
B :  Just trying to move mine right now .
A :  Okay . Um Courtney would you mind starting us off ? Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Trend watching ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Okay , so trend watching .
D :  Uh since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks . So I guess we can go ahead and go to the next . So what they want . Right now customers want fancy versus functional . Um basically about fifty eight percent of what they like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . So the customer basically is confused . They don't know exactly what they want . They want us to tell them .
B :  They want everything , but simply . Okay .
D :  Yes . Exactly . So we can go to next . Okay . So in Milan and Paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . So I don't know if we want to go with that um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . I don't know really , I mean I guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . I mean do you guys know what I mean . Yeah .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Mm . Mm .
B :  Yeah th
A :  Right . Yes .
D :  Um . But as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , I don't know if we really want to go with that , because it is just a trend , and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months , because Yeah . I mean that could just be a Spring thing right now .
A :  Right .
B :  I I can
A :  Right . People don't buy a new remote every so often .
B :  I can address some of that issue , I think , with uh my presentation .
D :  Okay . Awesome . Um so design preferences , um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled so that , I mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . Um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , you said that in your design , with the bulb . Um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . Uh we need the Real Reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . That's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product .
A :  Okay .
D :  And I was thinking about different types of designs and I came up with something . Actually right here . So what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone like this , where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , I mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . 'Cause then it'll appeal to older generation and like said retro's cool . So it's classically retro . So I mean that's just an idea if you guys like it . And , yep . And that's it .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Very good . I like it . Okay , ready for the next slide ?
A :  Op mm 'kay .
B :  Okay .
A :  Great . Great presentation .
A :  Ready ?
C :  Okay hang on .
A :  'Kay .
C :  See if it's there .
A :  Which one is it ?
C :  I don't know . Hang on . Interface concepts , no ?
A :  Interface concepts new .
C :  Either refresh it , or it sh Oh wait , maybe I didn't put it there . Hang on .
A :  'Kay .
B :  Mine will always read copy of something or other . I I copied mine before I sent it over .
A :  Sorry ?
A :  Oh okay .
C :  Sorry , hang on .
C :  Don't know .
A :  Oh there we go .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay , um looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . Uh if you wanna start the next slide .
A :  Sure .
C :  Um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways , on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , so you have that option right there . And then also there's the idea of the base . That's sort of like an idea there . And then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the iPod . It's becoming really and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and
C :  um and very simple , but technologically advanced . So if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control then sort of
C :  look into it , but Anyway , next .
A :  Mm 'kay .
C :  Um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . You'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . And the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a V_ , and so yo you're kind of feeling a V_ like volume up . What it really is is a V_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow . And so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up .
A :  Mm .
C :  Um but then you have you could either do it by raised type , which could be you know , iffy , um sort of old-fashioned in a way . Either that or just have it by shape , for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . And then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . So it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel . Okay .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
C :  Um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . Um this is particularly geared towards children . Um it's very cute , and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . Um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . Um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain
D :  That's cute .
C :  channels that only these children would watch , so it's like they ch watch , you know , the C_ Beebies or something like that ,
C :  uh keep them away from other channels .
C :  So that's like another ar Um , I mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . You have the wider section for the main controls there . Uh you could see how many buttons there are . And then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . On the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , because it's more for like a D_V_D_ function which we are not gonna be using . Um .
A :  Okay .
C :  So again it's sort of like just give you ideas and then down at the bottom you have the logos and that's where you could put the R_R_ , Real Reaction .
A :  'Kay .
C :  And then finally these are like the sort of same examples , but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . None of them I'm particularly keen on by the way .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
A :  No .
C :  But it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this .
A :  Mm . Or I like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever .
C :  Right .
D :  I have four of those remotes .
A :  Good lord . Okay . Ready ? Oh , yeah . Okay .
C :  That's it .
A :  Great job .
B :  Okay , my turn .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Whoo .
A :  What's the title ?
B :  It'll be copy of component design .
A :  Got it .
B :  Yeah . Th that looks like it .
B :  'Kay . So basic remote operation runs as follows , press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , chip senses the connection , chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . So you press the button , it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . Transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the T_V_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . So that being said Next slide , please .
B :  Findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , all those basic things that make a circuit function . Um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself .
B :  An L_E_D_ , which is a light emitting diode , um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . Next slide , please . Thank you . Uh personal preferences , uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . Um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , L_E_D_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it .
B :  Next slide , please . Um just talking to the um manufacturing division . They suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , so you shake it and it increases the power . Um I'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , they have yet to get back to me on that . So next slide , please . Suggested casing options . Okay . We can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , very specific to the customer . Options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood . I don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one , because splinters
A :  Hmm .
A :  Interesting .
D :  That would be amazing , though , yeah . No , splinters would
B :  Yeah . Um certain restrictions do apply here though . Uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . So , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . Double-curved , you can't do titanium . Um that would be two curvatures , so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . Now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . And uh so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . I think I have one more slide . No , I didn't .
D :  What is that ?
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
C :  Right .
A :  'Kay .
A :  No , okay .
B :  Um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . Um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . So depends on what we decide we wanna do . In addition to that if we're offering all those different options to the customer for producing their remote , we're going to have to have multiples of each type , like a double-curved in rubber , um you know , each option should have a certain select number produced with all those options . So we'll have to mix it up , make sure we produce enough of everyone . But that could also drive up the price of the actual remote itself if they know that we only produced five thousand , you know , double-curved wooden remotes .
A :  Mm .
D :  Right .
A :  Hmm . Okay . Alright , well thank you for those informative presentations . Let's go back to um Now we have to make some decisions .
D :  Okay .
B :  And that's all I got .
A :  Where were we ?
C :  Let me just add one more thing that I couldn't say before , and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition .
A :  Sure .
C :  Um .
D :  Oh this the thing we were talking about earlier .
C :  Right except that it's sort of odd , and I'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for So , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , Jill , but
C :  I'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions . So does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , or can it be altered in a certain way , or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this .
A :  Mm .
A :  Right . Right .
D :  Yeah , like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . So that way the remote reads it .
C :  Right , so it's got like a limited memory and programme it . So it's sort of iffy , but that's kind of what you'd say .
A :  Mm .
D :  I feel like voice recognition would be ,
D :  I don't know , w it would be too hard to really I mean we could do it , but
A :  Hmm .
A :  Programme .
A :  If it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology
D :  Technology .
B :  Well , we are making the chip . So , I mean
A :  Hmm .
B :  But , I guess , we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . Yeah .
D :  And it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like
A :  Mm .
D :  the , I mean just like the more advanced it is ,
D :  the better it'll sell .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I I thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know I think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe . So that we could reduce cost . Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy .
A :  Okay , that kind of brings us to this , let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . Um .
B :  Okay .
A :  Do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ?
D :  Oh the base , yeah .
A :  The base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ?
C :  I always feel like first I wanna know what it looks like , before 'Cause if it's something really really small , then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it , that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up
B :  I think the p
A :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah , and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the T_V_ . It's not gonna be a huge universal remote .
C :  Right .
D :  We need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want and exactly
A :  What size battery and
C :  Well , the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons .
D :  It could be like this . Yes . I'd , well uh
D :  This one is really comfortable , like I like the sides whatever , because
C :  Are you gonna lose it easier ?
D :  But if we have the um , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that .
B :  That's true .
D :  So we can make it small if we have a l locating device .
B :  If we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . So
C :  Yeah .
C :  So i That's the other thing , it's like
D :  Hmm .
C :  You know
C :  Are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period ?
D :  Two double A_s ,
D :  for this size .
C :  But like , you know , if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size .
D :  Right .
B :  Honestly , I think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base if we did do a nice small , compact
A :  Right . I agree , it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just
D :  Yeah .
C :  So we sh
D :  Smaller , without Yeah .
A :  A battery like this guy . Alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? You wanna vote ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm yeah .
D :  I think if we had a a locating device with the small one , I think that seems way more advanced .
A :  I'm kind of I'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of
B :  Yeah .
C :  I'm a away from
C :  the base . Yeah .
A :  bigger and the base . That just seems so clunky and
D :  Yeah .
B :  'Kay so
D :  Yeah , because I mean if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is , yeah
C :  Smaller and smaller , yeah , yeah , yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  The only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash .
D :  Oh .
C :  You're kidding .
B :  You know it happens . I've had three watches go that way too .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Oh watches I've but I've never washed a cell phone .
D :  Ouch .
D :  A phone , whoa , that would wow , that would hurt .
A :  Okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ?
B :  Pieces everywhere .
B :  Well , we have lots of options . I don't think wood is a viable option .
D :  Yeah wood .
A :  No . Oh what did you Oh sorry , go ahead .
C :  Well , titanium s I was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then
C :  I would probably lean away from that .
D :  Yeah , 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive .
A :  Right . What would you recommend ?
B :  However , well , we only wanna sell it for twenty five Euro right ? 'Cause I was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , make them a rarity so to speak .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  That'll Yeah , exactly .
A :  Mm .
C :  The selling point , yeah .
D :  We could do that , because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if
C :  Are we restricted by this ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well the original
A :  I I think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.I'm not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of
C :  Twenty five Euros
B :  Okay .
A :  remotes . If this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , I think .
B :  Yeah . Good plan .
D :  Good plan .
A :  Okay , so we wanna go for plastic , or what would you recommend for materials ?
B :  Honestly I'd recommend like um uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , I'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex , because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . We could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so , because this year is all fruit , God only knows why , um we could do f a cherry cover for this year and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know
A :  Hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , who knows .
C :  So you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ?
A :  Okay .
D :  O or we could like take off this .
A :  They could buy cases , maybe ,
B :  They could come back . And buy the extra case . So we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start .
C :  Okay .
A :  if they wanted . I think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell
A :  options .
D :  Yeah .
C :  The what the top face , right ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Okay .
D :  Yeah , because the soft latex definitely is squishy . That's in . Well I mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic .
A :  Right . Right .
A :  Okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ?
B :  How complicated Are we gonna go with the voice activated
C :  Yeah .
A :  I don't think we should do voice , I think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know . could we Yeah .
C :  A tracker , yeah .
D :  'Cause that uh what it type of , yeah , for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like ,
A :  Hmm .
D :  because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time .
A :  Right .
D :  So uh
B :  Well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing .
D :  Ooh . Uh see I'm uh I'm strangely attracted to it , because I know that's it's definitely gonna be big , because it's , I don't know , it's just so high-tech .
C :  Well , my little sister got for Christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work . And then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off . So it became highly irritating .
B :  Yeah , see that would just irritate me .
A :  Oh dear .
D :  Oh , then maybe voice
B :  So I think having a key-phrase is much better .
A :  Okay .
D :  maybe voice activation won't be good .
A :  Okay . Alright . But it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , right ? Just a Okay , alright .
D :  Yeah , n n no , we just want it to be a finder .
C :  But then it
B :  No .
C :  Hmm . Okay .
D :  But do can your can the department make
B :  That would be like a mid-class um Yeah . So we don't actually have to go for
D :  Oh , brilliant then .
B :  Well , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's a brand new chip . Why not introduce it in this way ?
A :  No .
D :  Yeah , good point .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  Uh and what size batteries , double A_ , triple A_ ?
D :  I think triple A_ , it'll be lighter .
A :  Two ?
A :  Could it run off of two
D :  I mean more more come in a package . Yeah .
C :  Well , that depends on what the energy is needed .
B :  I think , well , we could d r do two or we could do one small lithium , 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? So they're more widely available now . And they also have a longer battery life than most batteries . But if you only have to replace it every five years .
A :  They're more expensive though , too .
A :  Mm .
D :  That's a good point .
A :  Thoughts anybody ?
C :  As long as we sell it with it .
B :  Well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it , 'cause I'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk . Yeah .
C :  Right , that's what I meant .
D :  We could think about it and come back to it next meeting . We still have one more meeting .
A :  Okay . Yeah . Alright .
A :  Okay .
A :  So we've covered that first category , User Interface Concept , meaning design .
C :  What's it gonna Yeah , what's it gonna look like .
A :  Okay . I ki I kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial , and that the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ?
C :  Um .
A :  It might be the four way scroll , too . I mean if Yeah .
D :  Yeah , it could be whatever , as long as there's something big in the middle , because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are , because w And then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ?
A :  Mm .
D :  Oh , that's true .
D :  Good point .
B :  In the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , which I think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , that could be particularly useful .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Oh , I see what you mean .
A :  I think so .
D :  So scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ?
A :  Yeah , I like that . 'Kay .
D :  But we definitely If we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled .
A :  Mm .
B :  Well , if it's just up and down
D :  Yeah , like on the side of it . Oh if it's just up and down .
C :  But is that for Which ?
B :  Volume or channel . I don't know .
D :  Well , you could do some on both sides .
C :  Do we have both sides ?
B :  Mm yeah . We should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know .
A :  Can we ?
D :  Yeah . That's squishy . That's squishy .
A :  So that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan
C :  Well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side .
D :  have buttons .
A :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , that .
A :  Hmm .
A :  'Kay any other ideas ?
C :  Um what colour ?
A :  Oh , yeah . Latex covers . W
B :  We have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available .
C :  Well I sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the R_R_ like that .
C :  And that's at the bottom of it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  I think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , because if people are able to change the covers , I don't know , maybe the on-off button , something , some the menu button , I don't know , but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get
C :  Which button ?
A :  another one . Are they all gonna have our company logo on them ? Every cover ?
B :  Yeah , I don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . So I think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea .
A :  Yeah .
A :  If we want it to be visible and
A :  Um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? But those are plastic , right ? They're not titanium . I kind of like that look . Uh but , or if it was really Yeah , for the base or if we're going for the retro look , I think , like a really shiny black would be cool .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  For our base one ?
D :  Yeah , or like a gun-metal grey , 'cause then it combines the silver and the black .
A :  What are your thoughts ? Gun-metal gray .
A :  There you go , gun-metal gray .
C :  I'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button .
A :  Why ?
B :  It'll wear off .
D :  Yeah , buttons wear off .
C :  What's the button Well , w w then what's the button do , and how do you know that that is what the button does ?
A :  Mm .
C :  I guess . Just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing .
A :  Right .
D :  Hmm .
B :  There's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual
D :  But we want it to be seen . We need it to be seen .
C :  But you don't But uh , yeah , you don't see it .
A :  On the back ? It d visible Visibility though 'Cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery .
C :  Well , hang on .
C :  The other option is , I don't know if you can see it but it's like if
A :  I can find it again .
C :  Yeah , it's like the second to last slide .
A :  Okay . And yours was called Interface Concept ?
C :  Interface , yeah .
A :  This one ? Well , for some reason I can't get it to just go to that slide directly .
C :  Yeah . Um .
C :  Okay , it's the very right one . You see at the bottom , it's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top . It doesn't necessarily replace the entire top . And so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in .
A :  Mm .
A :  Okay , yes yes .
C :  If c you envisioning it ? And so that stays the same when you have the logo , and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes .
A :  Okay .
B :  The only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , so I was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
A :  Like a little cut-out kind of
B :  Yeah .
C :  Right . That's like , you know , a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened .
A :  Okay .
D :  Right .
C :  And so , what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the R_R_ ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Some of tho
A :  Anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ?
D :  Well , some of those buttons though are blue-based . Um well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based . Well , kind of . Um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . Like if we like the one all the way on the left , uh you ca you can see it on your computer better . Um where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . So we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yellow .
A :  Yellow , I like that idea .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Oh , that one .
A :  I like the yellow illumination idea , very good .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Any other ideas or thoughts ?
C :  Um . Ha hang on Let me catch up .
A :  We all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  'Kay .
C :  Did we finalise what buttons we're including or we just everything that we said before ?
A :  I think there will be time for that later . I'm guessing .
A :  'Kay , well we're gonna wrap this up . Um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes ,
A :  and here's what we're each of us going to do . The I_D_ is going to do the look and feel design , the U_I_D_ the user interface design . I think you're going to get a lot of , I mean , the final say on what buttons get put We'll all talk about it , but I think , that's pretty much what you're gonna do , right ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  I guess . 'Kay . And you're gonna do some product evaluation . Okay , and right now , the I_D_ and U_I_D_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay .
B :  Great . Play Doh .
A :  Yeah . Okay , and you should all be getting an email pretty soon . Alright . Well , thank you for a very productive meeting .
C :  Fun .
B :  Ooh .
A :  Hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . Um . Alright we're moving on to conceptual design .
C :  'Scuse me .
D :  Bless you .
A :  Um , I'll just review what we did in our last meeting . Um , under marketing we targeted our audience , and
A :  Um , yeah .
A :  That was generally how helpful that was . Um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , um , we discussed an iPod-like button system which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're
A :  Right , um
A :  So , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time .
A :  Does everyone have presentations ?
B :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
B :  Yes .
A :  Okay . Would anybody like to go first ?
B :  Sure .
A :  Okay .
B :  So I've been looking at the components design . Um . Mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting .
B :  Um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . Um , I assume we'll be custom designing our case , probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator .
B :  And we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . But once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out .
B :  Um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the iPod-style wheel . The infrared L_E_D_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . Um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . And al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote .
B :  So we have some material options . Um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . Um , I'd recommend against titanium because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . Um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case .
A :  And why not wood ? And why not wood ?
B :  And , hmm ?
B :  Uh , well we can use wood . I don't know why we'd want to . Um and also we should note that if we want an iPod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . We can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . I don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive .
B :  So that's what I've got on design .
A :  'S good .
D :  Um , can I do next ? 'Cause I have to say something about the material
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  which is quite shocking .
D :  Ha . Mm .
D :  Right , um , I have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . Um . Next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . And th last thing is the
D :  easy to use um factor . Um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , but I suppose that is included in in the ease of use . Um , our fashion-watchers in Milan and Paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . Um .
D :  For fashion , we go for fashion . The fashion in electronics . So we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . And also go for a spongy feel , so the the question of our technology whate is Industrial Designer . As to the material should be limited to I don't know how spongy it can be , should discuss this together , I don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go .
A :  Mm .
D :  Um . I I have been thinking about this fruit and vegetable thing and I prefer fruits to vegetables , but that's just a personal opinion . I think I think people like to have a fruit instead of a vegetables in their sitting room . Uh those are just suggestions and also we need to decide whether this should be printed , so that still has to do with the material discuss should we print the fruit stuff , or should the actual remote look like a fruit ?
D :  Um , and finally again with the spongy . It has to be technologically innovative so maybe again our Industrial Designer should look into that or find come up with a solution that's better than mine . Um , yeah , to summarise these are the points that need to be
D :  um , touched in order to get a good decision , and hopefully our User Interface has more to say about the matter . Thank you for your attention .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So .
A :  I think it's the next it's the blue one , yeah .
C :  Oh , uh , there we go . Uh .
C :  Okay . Um . Well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . I actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics and and uh
D :  Neither was I . Well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um fabrics .
A :  Yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control .
C :  So so okay , let me get this right . Okay , uh
C :  Okay , alright anyway . Um here we go . Conceptual User Interface . Trying we're gonna try to talk about , um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this iPod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . And , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . Uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . Um , kind of I mean I assume , are we still on the screen idea ?
A :  Oh we s hadn't discussed it last time .
C :  'Cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um the wheel
A :  You need a screen for it ?
C :  you it seems like you would need a screen .
B :  You need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , like you know that band or whatever . With T_V_ channels it's , you know , one two three . So
C :  But like if you think about it yeah but if so is it just okay . So , b you you're gonna have to switch to like D_V_D_ and like other things like that , aren't you ? Are we
A :  We're , um , we're actually not having D_V_D_ , that was one of th I I was sorry , I I meant to update you on that . Um .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Alright . Okay .
D :  But the screen can come up on the telly , the she said . That correct ?
C :  Okay . Okay . So anyway if well we just we need to Okay so if we're not gonna have a screen I think I was thinking okay . So basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? And you're just gonna I mean I think you're gonna have to have some kind of a right . Yeah like you're g yeah like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can okay we're not choosing that , I guess . But like choose channel control , like if you wa Because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . So that people seems to be well
B :  Yeah .
D :  Graphical interface ? Uh on the you can have it on the telly though .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  You've Yeah , I know what you're saying , you have to
C :  You know . But you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . So um I guess that's wh why I was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen because
C :  So that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if or or then again if you just I guess I c I can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the T_V_ like what channel you're on . You can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  But but imagine someone with s
B :  My flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the T_V_ .
C :  I oh yeah ?
A :  But i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . Then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to
C :  'Cause you'll have to like but you can quickly s you can
D :  Yeah .
B :  They have to r wheel really fast . But I think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels , at least on theirs .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be you I mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , and um
C :  So you're either you're you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different
A :  Yeah .
C :  uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume or , like you can tap just to get to different channels .
C :  Like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth
A :  Right .
C :  And then there's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , or if you want to um you know switch around , I don't know , like , these different modes like turn on the timer or like something something like that , like
A :  I mean with that many options , you'd uh I'd think that the screen would be better , because you could have that menu option , sort of
C :  I would think so too , like
C :  So I mean and it seems it w it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , because but then again it would it does make kind of if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of m yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  It's more expensive according to the design people . You have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal .
A :  Uh .
C :  Yeah , that's the only thing though .
C :  Yeah . So then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um
A :  Mm .
C :  You can get to you know , you can
C :  Like maybe it'll be that central button that , like , then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the T_V_ and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . So the T_V_ is the screen , that yeah
A :  So it would have all these different options of changing
C :  Yeah . But the remote itself isn't really cluttered up .
A :  to
D :  Look it even has settings .
A :  Okay .
D :  On the you can just take theirs and just
C :  Hmm ? Yeah , well we don't want the screen I guess , but um 'cause that just it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive , but I dunno , and then so , it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So
A :  Um , right .
A :  What if I mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing , or whatever we're thinking . I mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? Or
C :  Yeah .
C :  It doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow I mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the T_V_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . I mean okay .
C :  Yeah . Yeah definitely . Like , I think we're looking at something that could be , like
C :  like even maybe like a cir I'm f I'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . I mean it it needs to be easy to somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate and use your
D :  Yeah but should be comfortable .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I mean how do how do I'm not really
C :  Like when I use an iPod , I end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . So
A :  Yeah , I've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah .
C :  Yeah . Or your thumb or something . So
D :  Yeah I use it like that .
B :  W when we had the wheely remote control , we it was on the top I think , if you held it like that .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , so
D :  Yeah .
A :  But , were there buttons on there as well ?
B :  Yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that I don't know what they do . So we just used the top part .
A :  Mm . Yeah .
C :  Mm yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , so but I mean I think it could be pretty small . Like , I d I mean , you you want it to be large enough that
D :  Uh .
C :  you can
A :  What if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? Like you so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? So the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it .
C :  But can't you just get
A :  Do do you know what I'm talking about though ? Like , uh , yeah just something
B :  Yeah . Yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of
D :  Well you can have it on the settings , no ?
A :  Yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah , But , I mean , do you need that ? If if you can get to , you know if so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the T_V_ screen . That keeps it
A :  Yeah I mean I guess that's the thing is is if w I if we can do this , that'd probably be
B :  Yeah .
C :  really
C :  Yeah . Uh you wouldn't I don't I just don't think you would even need it . So
A :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  So I guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this how they actually programme these things , and if that's yeah .
C :  Mean
B :  Oh how they make the menu show up on the T_V_ ?
D :  They already do it .
B :  I don't know . I believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the T_V_ , not inside the remote .
C :  I mean you can do it , you it's it doesn't seem that hard .
A :  I mean it would y would that would be
C :  I mean I've never bought a remote . It sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television , which is a little
B :  I'm not sure .
B :  Well they usually are . Well
C :  My I've never bought just a remote , like , so I don't I don't really know . But um
D :  No .
A :  Huh .
B :  I guess that's right . It always comes with the T_V_ .
C :  So , um but I mean it's I've never had a hard time with like my remotes , like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . And I don't think that should uh that should be too hard .
B :  Yeah , it most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . 'Cause it just doesn't come up every day or something .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Well so
C :  So , do we need I dunno . Well I guess we have to you know think about But I mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . That's what it does anyway .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  But also if you have it on the screen you can actually write everything out , because the problem with buttons is you like , they have these sort of abbreviations and codes that you're supposed to understand , and I never get it . Never ever . So
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , you don't know they mean , yeah , it's like yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  So , but oh , you mean if we have this screen like the iPod screen ? On the telly , okay , yeah . So yeah I think , I mean , I think I think the touch-based graphical interface is a really uh cool idea because you know it is so obnoxious to like have to push those like okay now I hit this you know , you have your little guide out and you're like , hit this button twice , like to activate the date .
D :  Well on the telly .
B :  Or on the T_V_ too .
A :  Mm . And it is technologically innovative in a way , so that fits with the
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah . I guess . And it is trendy , the iPods are really hot right now , so
A :  Yeah .
D :  Did you did you get that pc picture on did they provide you with that picture on the web ?
C :  Um , yeah , by web research , yeah , so
D :  That's quite interesting .
D :  What are we going to do about this vegetable thing that I'm dreading ?
A :  Oh god .
C :  Oh .
B :  Oh , I was gonna say . You said uh people want spongy . Um , one of your one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in like those stress ball things . So , that would be spongy .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Oh , okay , that would be cool . Mm .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Ah . Yeah .
D :  Just nice feel , but I hate spongy .
C :  Yeah , c that's e that would be kind of oh , you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing . But what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda so you're like
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I mean definitely the area round it .
A : 
B :  Yeah I think it could work .
C :  Or what if we integrated the the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like
A :  Yeah .
B :  Don't think I'd want it to feel like a banana .
D :  Well it could be like mobiles that just you just put a cover .
C :  a vegetable .
A :  An orange .
C :  Yeah .
D :  If it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana , which frankly I'm not particularly fond of , um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing . You know you had there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  You could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits .
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah . You could name it after fruits and vegetables , or
D :  Yeah .
D :  And it could the colour can fit your sitting room , so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have well I don't know . Um .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So what if what this is I'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . If you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , so like what you're feeling is comfortable , and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . And on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . Is that kind of I 'cause I I'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours . Um
C :  So I think yeah , colours .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables . I do I dunno . Um
A :  I mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just the feedback we've just got about the
D :  Maybe a ball .
A :  A ball ?
D :  Know , a squashy ball . A relaxing squashy ball .
D :  That you can p well I see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit and I'm thinking how do you change the hard would you put a um
C :  That's in the shape of a fruit , like a
A :  Yeah .
D :  sticker sort of ? Because I was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , like a
A :  This is just
A :  Okay . Say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . Squashy .
D :  Oh , okay , yeah .
D :  Yeah I was thinking of getting a cover for
A :  That see I was thinking this s sorry I was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing . And like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there . Um but
D :  Which is cheaper . Well I don't know if it's cheaper actually .
B :  Oh . Mm .
C :  Yeah . Oh I like that shape .
C :  Yeah .
B :  I was thinking sort of a single ball shape . So you're holding a squishy ball and then it has a
C :  Yeah .
A :  I was thinking if it was like this 'cause the way you were describing the the iPod and the thi the roll thingy
C :  It's like it has to be s yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It's almost like your thumb is farther up , so if if you could squish it lower then
B :  Yeah I guess so .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . So it wouldn't be very big in either like how big ? This big , and then you just do that , I suppose .
C :  What if , yeah , what if the squishy , oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , and you can so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing and you could get you could have your choice , you know ?
A :  Yeah , I know what you meant , yeah .
D :  Well just a li I can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover . But well the question is , which one's easiest to change and we can just contact our relevant department for that , and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , and for now we can do two prototypes maybe and then hi try and ask users what the best is , and
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Okay .
C :  Yeah . Oh .
D :  No .
D :  Um . That's nicer . I think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Um .
A :  Well that's not very neat , but
C :  Yeah . I mean I think uh and I think the handhe I think the handheld part is definitely
C :  So you could make that
C :  into the fruit and vegetable part .
D :  If it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your
D :  to the way you hold it . If it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you it it just moulds to your hand .
B :  Yeah you could squish it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . So where are the fruit and vegetables now ?
D :  We we don't know .
C :  Fruits and veg .
B :  I guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And the rest is the company the company colour's silver ?
A :  It was , yeah , silver and yellow . It l it looks like I don't
C :  We could promote the banana one . Like mm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I mean that's another question , where are we gonna we we should have the logo somewhere on it .
C :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm . Should also fit the batteries , which we haven't
C :  Oh yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case .
A :  Yeah , th and that would that
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
B :  Especially if you're switching out the squishy part . Then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , I think , um
C :  it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit .
C :  The part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits . But uh it
B :  Well I dunno . You'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . Then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again .
C :  Yeah .
D :  No but it does it automatically . Does it automatically ? I don't know .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . But if someone components concept . Question mark . Energy . Question mark . Was that you ? Okay . Oh right right . Yeah . Um , so what d but what do we know about
D :  Okay .
B :  That was me .
B :  Yes .
A :  energy ? I mean we're gonna use batteries right ? And
B :  Uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , which is something I don't know what it is . Something to do with torches .
D :  Oh , a dynamo is ah , it's a bicycle . It's a bicycle mechanism . It's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy .
B :  Oh okay . Yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . So I sort of picked battery . We could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . Um but I think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways .
D :  It's quite sweet .
A :  I think batteries sound good . What does everyone else think ?
B :  It it seems a little weird for a living room anyways .
C :  The dynamo would be interesting .
D :  No . But dynamo the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it creates energy on its own .
C :  Oh .
A :  What about Kryptonite ?
D :  Which is quite cool . So if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f I find them annoying . But we need to find cost .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Don't know the cost .
D :  Does anyone have costs on the on the web ?
B :  Didn't have enough data to actually
B :  All it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . It didn't give me any actual cost .
D :  Okay .
D :  Right .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  Most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . So I don't think it's that much of a problem .
B :  Like the chip is probably the most expensive part .
A :  What does chip on print mean ?
B :  Um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , calculators too I think . Um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . But it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right .
A :  So , chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced . Okay . And case ? Uh I guess that's what we've been talking about , yeah . Casing . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Case is what we were discussing yeah .
A :  thinking of like syntactic case and thi um let's see .
A :  Is there anything else we need to
C :  Hmm .
A :  talk about ? Oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough .
A :  Um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . And you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation .
A :  So you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach .
D :  Oh , thank you .
A :  Mm .
C :  Cool .
A :  See you soon .
A :  Does it matter that I end early ?
D :  I it's strange because
A :  How how early is it ?
A :  I didn't get a pop-up thing that said
A :  Alright ? Alright . Thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . Um I think we uh made some definite progress at the last one um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . Um I'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . Um the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . Um they've got lots of buttons on them that uh people don't use and find difficult to learn . Um and people lose them . And
A :  We we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . That um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , A_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and B_ as uh a Real Reaction product . So that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . Uh
A :  Okay .
A :  So again um , I'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . Um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , whether i it is practical to use uh um
A :  a a a long lasting one . And uh I I think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . And uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life .
A :  Um now the the the internal chip um and uh this is where I need uh uh Kate's expert advice and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? Or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? Uh I mean I'm I'm I'm
A :  n not an expert on these things , but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . But uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise . And then the uh , you know , the the overall design of the case uh is is is Kendra's field and uh
A :  we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward and we'll we'll finalise those
A :  uh da today . Um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , whether we p um
A :  go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . Uh
A :  and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting Kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , Kendra the uh
A :  ho how the the user actually uses it and and Andrew of course the the product evaluation . And uh Kate and Kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . Uh so , if if we can have the the three presentations again please , and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k .
B :  Okay . Um
A :  Kate .
A :  Oh I'm sorry , oh sorry .
B :  Um p there we go .
B :  'Kay , I'll just be talking about the components design . And
B :  Okay , basically I just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . Uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command and then this is translated uh into uh light signals which are then seen by the T_V_ . Uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . Um .
B :  Uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command and this creates a a connection within the the remote that allows the chip the chip then senses this connection and produces a signal in a Morse code format . This signal's sent to the transistor which amplifies it and then sends it on to the light emitting diode and uh which is then trai changed into a infrared light which is sent to the T_V_ and sort of seen by the T_V_ and which uh changes the channels .
B :  Um . Oh . Uh cool .
B :  Uh so as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . Uh y the fewer buttons you have , I guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . Um
B :  however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult and uh raise the production cost . That's something we should think about . Also we have to work within the company constraints , and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it .
B :  Um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , so I was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years and we could still keep that original idea .
B :  Um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . Um , however that's gonna cost more , but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , which haven't really been used much on remotes , so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . And that pretty much sums it up .
A :  Okay , so how um sorry , can you uh just put that one back up again , please ? Um .
B :  Mm . Oh yep , sorry . Yep .
A :  Uh d d d okay , I mean uh inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . Do we do we know uh by how much ?
B :  Mm .
B :  Um I don't actually have any price information , no .
A :  And and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip .
B :  Um it a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . Oh w yeah , we did the the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form , uh so it would uh it's hard to predict the time .
A :  Right , okay .
A :  Right , I think we need to make a a decision here . Uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology .
B :  Mm .
A :  Um uh now before we go round everybody else , does anybody um
C :  I
A :  h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ?
C :  I just have a question about that . Um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one and then you've programmed in say B_B_C_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , it's like to have a certain number of favourites um and that w
B :  W just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . Once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit , but to actually the the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working .
C :  Okay . Then it doesn't matter . Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  Cause uh I must say I find it slightly surprising given that , you know , mobile phones incorporate voice activated dialling . So uh um I mean I d d for slightly different well no , I mean , it's if you you
C :  Yeah .
A :  speak somebody's name and it'll dial the number for you , so uh bu I mean the this this information is from is this is the internal company information , is it ?
B :  Uh bits of it , yeah .
C :  Of course mobile phones do tend to be more expensive , you know , hundred and fifty pounds or something .
A :  So uh
B :  Yes , as well .
C :  As opposed to the twenty Euros , twenty five Euros .
A :  Yeah , mm true , again but if it's without any without any uh p price informations that's uh difficult to uh
A :  uh decide .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Also lots of mobile phones have got a lot of technology in them , not just that , so .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , that's that's right . It's like it's it's you can't 'cause mobile phones are expensive , you can't say it's the voice recognition bit that is . But we don't know . Um .
C :  Yeah .
A :  I mean uh
A :  I su i I mean if given that the um the technology is not well developed and and given that it's it's never been done before , um th th the double risk ,
A :  uh perhaps we ought to uh stick to uh to buttons , since the last thing we want to do is present a product that doesn't work . Um .
A :  Thoughts ?
C :  Well , another thought I oh , sorry , go ahead .
D :  Would
D :  Oh I was just gonna say mayb maybe it sh
D :  like um
D :  maybe we can like cut corners somewhere else to bring in over cost .
A :  I mean do w do we think that the voice technology is fundamental to the project ?
B :  Uh it's fundament well I mean I guess it it's something we've discussed uh since the the sort of the beginning , so I th I think in in our in our minds it's it's fundamental , but I don't know that the uh the upper echelons of the company would necessarily agree with that , so I think you have to
A :  I mean I think we
C :  Oh yeah .
B :  Hm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
C :  Well , I kinda think if we're gonna have the voice recognition for part of it , then maybe we should have it for the whole thing .
A :  Yeah , I I I I I think that's uh
B :  Mm .
C :  And we've been talking about it the whole time . Anyway , I'm I'm incli kinda inclined to say that we should just go for it .
B :  Mm , mm .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Mm , right , okay .
B :  Mm .
D :  Uh yeah , it's the second most important aspect to users that the device should be technologically innovative .
C :  Yeah .
D :  From uh my presentation show , so . Uh technologically innovative .
A :  Yeah , it should be
A :  Right , okay , so .
B :  No , that sounds good . Mm .
A :  Fine . Okay . I it will have voice recognition um uh if if that means uh if that means we can't afford buttons but I mean b b second question , do we need the five buttons for channel change , up down , volume up down and on off , just as a a backup or just so that people can uh j j just sit there pressing buttons ?
B :  Mm . Cool .
C :  Okay .
B :  Um
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I I would say we do , yeah .
C :  I think so .
A :  Right .
A :  Okay . Sorry , d did you want to say anything ? No ? Okay . Shall we move rapidly on to uh Kendra ? Uh um ra rapidly move the cable over .
B :  Uh nope , that was it , that was it . Okay .
C :  Okay .
C :  Let's see .
A :  Mm .
A :  Oh good .
C :  Oh .
C :  Yes .
C :  Is it gonna work ?
B :  Yeah , it's thinking about it .
A :  Mm yeah , it'll get there . Yep .
C :  Okay . Okay , so I did some research on the internet and um what you know , the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , um commands and mechanisms for the operation , and there're just kind of a variety of choices . Um findings , so a lot of times they tend to look cluttered and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . There're some special ones available , like this one right here , which is marketed towards children , um different designs , and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a V_ in volume because people some
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Alright .
C :  Bring a little picture of what I thought ours could look like . So just kind of minimise the clutter , avoid too many buttons and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm yeah .
A :  Sorry y y yeah , if I can interrupt you . Well d p 'kay , do you wanna say anything about um slide controls ? I mean I think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh
B :  Uh I think they're they're about the same cost really . I I mean , I think it's just sort of the the there's a lot of slide buttons out there . I think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . Mm yeah .
A :  Okay , fair enough , fine .
C :  Just because I n for example if I'm using a mouse I like to be able to slide it up and down so I thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down and then the this is my great little drawing .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Good , good .
A :  Yeah .
A :  So three three there's three buttons on a slider . Three buttons , channel up channel up down and
C :  Y yes , yes .
D :  Well , if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . Because if it if you no if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks , if you know what I mean , up like one unit , if you see what I mean . So it kinda goes up one , then y like you can keep rolling it up , but it's like like like like a cog or something . So you kinda take it up one at a time .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Uh-huh .
A :  Okay . Um
C :  The only advantage I was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh .
A :  This one on the one side and one yeah . Okay .
D :  Uh you could you could as l as like a mouse you could
B :  Ye yeah , 'cause I've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different . You'd know what you were fiddling with .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , like the shape of it almost like a mouse , with a
A :  Yeah , or yeah uh th th the I mean thi this is what the we have to come up with is the the actual shape that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do .
C :  That was
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , so we we're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change
C :  Um well I was thinking kind of just for the volume , but what what do you guys think ? We could
A :  of one sort . Just for the volume , uh .
B :  Mm .
D :  I dunno if it depending on the final shape of it , 'cause you could have like , I dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , and then you could control the buttons with your fingers .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah , 'cause if yeah , in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , just the way it would
A :  Fingers , yeah . I mean it's it's
A :  It yeah , I mean it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two . So okay . Right so uh that's sorry is that that all you want to say at the mo okay , fine .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm yeah , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Oh yeah , yeah .
C :  I'm just gonna pass this along .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm right .
D :  Here we go . Uh yeah , this is my report on trend watching . The data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . And we got reports from Paris , Milan on new fashions .
A :  Right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And uh
D :  the most important aspect is the l the look it has to look fancy , look and feel
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  uh instead of the current functional look and feel . This is a st well I was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect , which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it . So uh and the third being easy to use is probably a given , we have to try and incorporate , so uh
A :  Mm .
A :  Well I I mean I th I think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those .
D :  Uh exactly , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  I s that out of sequence ? Uh yeah , sorry . Uh yeah , and uh from the fashion watchers from Milan and Paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . Uh sorry , clothes , shoes and furniture
C :  Oh .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  and uh
D :  a spongy material to be used on the on the outside .
A :  Mm I hadn't thought of that , that's different , certainly .
D :  Yeah . But uh I was gonna say um yeah , fruit and vegetables , uh important to this year um important to furniture , I'm just gonna say
B :  Mm .
A :  What ?
D :  uh f like it's in if if fashion if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . But fashions do don't last very long .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it and then we can just whip that off and
B :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Uh .
C :  Yeah like the kind you get on like hand weights . You know , that kind of spongy yeah .
B :  Mm , yeah , that weird I dunno what that is , but yeah .
A :  Uh .
D :  A kind of yeah . Oh
B :  Mm .
A :  Also means you can drop it without damaging it .
D :  Yeah . That's c cool .
B :  Uh , yeah , it's good as well . Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , that's true .
D :  Um you have we could
D :  if we could save depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ?
D :  Instead of having a ten year guarantee ? With interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  I I mean it its uh I that's an interesting idea , it's like the old Swatch watch where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those , 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before . Um that's yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity
B :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I
B :  I think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product .
A :  W I mean we we can uh uh b but I mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time . Um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Mm .
C :  What if we included the batteries in the cover ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh yeah . I like that . That all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers and yeah .
C :  So um like
C :  Yeah , so can I see that thing ? Just this as examples .
B :  Um .
A :  Yeah , yeah , I n I know the only p I mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together and it it it you know , total reliability , but I mean I d I I uh
C :  So f
B :  Uh yeah .
C :  Yeah , I guess that's
B :  Mm .
C :  true .
A :  I know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from .
D :  Or well , but like uh like more than just the battery , like a complete different like you've only got like , you know like th uh this bit's the bit you keep , and this is the expensive bit , this is like the chip and this is the microphone . And then this is the power source and the bit everyone sees . And then
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I th I s I think if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about uh even if it costs slightly more than that , um just building the whole thing in one , then having getting cheaper production costs um and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing , the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally . Um then if , you know , if people lose the cover , I mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many Euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote .
D :  Yeah , you probably are right .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , that's true .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . So , yeah .
A :  Yeah , I mean it is it's up to it's up to
C :  Yeah , just another five Euro to get
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item . Um and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available . And um
B :  Mm .
C :  Right .
B :  Mm , yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  And that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly . Yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly .
A :  that's that's right , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah , like they have for mobile phones that are just fruits and animal prints and colours . Yeah , okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So uh i so uh okay . Um right , sorry . Um we hadn't finished your
D :  Um oh , don't worry it's all said , I was just gonna say uh yeah , are we gonna make this as part of like like uh a part of the f like it it the fashions apply to furniture , so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ?
A :  It's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me .
B :  Mm . Mm-hmm .
A :  Um this is fashionable . I , you know , I'm I'm I'm with it , I'm up to date . And you know , th the the design that I've got , and and it could be a a home-made design , um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control , this is , you know , a fashion accessory . Um ,
D :  Yeah . This is fashionable with
B :  Yeah .
A :  so I mean the the the basic shape i is is what we uh I mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else , um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing .
B :  Mm .
A :  And , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , and I don't suggest we make it look like a banana , but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , you know , t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . Um
B :  Mm .
D :  Oh yeah .
A :  mm or uh 'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a Real Reaction remote control , I want one of those .
B :  I dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow I kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the R_R_ in it somewhere on it , but I'd yellow seems a bit of a strong colour to make the ent like the thing no , but I mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . Yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah uh the the uh or or b
C :  Yeah , like an .
A :  Yeah , I'd I'd um yeah . Uh no I d I I agree , I mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  And make that a fashion symbol as well .
C :  Well n
A :  Well , th this is this is the whole point , yes , you know , I'm I've got a a Real Reaction uh remote control to go with my Real Reaction coffee maker or or whatever . And uh then people , you know , people demand more Real Reaction stuff .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well I was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse . So that , you know , when they hold it it's because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape so they could hold on to it , but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and
B :  Mm . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  have the power , wherever , somewhere .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I mean I've uh yeah .
C :  I mean that was just an idea that I had .
A :  Oh no that well there's the sim my my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape so that you can just sort of ho hold it .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , maybe . Kind of a c
B :  Yeah , you'd want it narrower than a mouse though 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , you want something you can definitely grip . So maybe it'd be
A :  W it I mean well it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse , but held , you know , so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons .
C :  Yeah . Sort of a combination .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , and fiddle around with it and press it .
C :  Yeah so yeah , kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , and then if you had
B :  Maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen and then it widens up top and you can fiddle an yeah .
C :  Yeah , then wider up here . And then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the T_V_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something . What do you guys think about that ?
B :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , cool .
D :  Yeah , that sounds
A :  Okay , yeah , yeah .
D :  Um I'm just I'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels t we still can just tell it to . I mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ?
C :  Oh yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  It's a very good point .
C :  It is a very good point .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I think we d I think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . That um the we n we need the the manual controls and that they should be of that form , but that uh yeah .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  But do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , but you can also bring it up like that and it's microphone-esque , yeah , yeah .
A :  Then you just bring it up to your mouth and just speak to it , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yeah , and just say
D :  Yeah , maybe we cou like w like we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice .
B :  Mm .
A :  I th I th honest uh my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway um .
D :  Mm I suppose , but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your T_V_ or the contrast needs changing .
A :  It's cer it's certainly possible I mean , but they we we're going beyond w w given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work um .
B :  Mm .
D :  Hmm yeah .
B :  Well you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . I mean uh if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness and and sc and then you can you can minimise the buttons and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff .
A :  Uh
D :  Yeah , that's a good idea .
C :  Yeah , I suppose I sup
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  If we we're I mean I'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available .
C :  So I guess we could have a menu button as well . We could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . So have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume .
B :  Yeah
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh uh uh
A :  Okay , if we if we're going down that route , then
A :  we need some sort of display . Do we need some sort of display ? We actually use the television , okay . Okay , okay , okay .
B :  But the television would be the display that things like that usually c pop up on a televi like you hit menu and menu will come up on television and have like tint brightness , and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's on the T_V_ , yeah .
C :  Yeah , and then y
D :  Well I mean on a onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button .
A :  Yep .
B :  Yeah , yeah , that's true .
C :  Yeah , press that is t yeah , that might work . Yeah , it's like um yeah , it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . You just press it .
B :  I never understood how that worked though , but yeah .
B :  Yeah , mm .
C :  Yeah , and you could just click that to so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select .
B :  Mm , oka yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh yeah .
C :  You know what I mean ?
A :  Mm yeah . Okay , we got five minutes to go in this meeting , so um I d I think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um .
C :  Okay .
B :  Cool .
A :  So um b b Kate and Kendra now go away and uh pa play play with a bit of Plasticine or play-dough , whatever it is on the other side of the Atlantic . Um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh I was gonna say concrete , but that's a slightly inappropriate word um to something that we can we can see and um Andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control .
B :  Play with play-dough .
D :  Hmm .
D :  Uh can I just get some things clear just for my sake . Our energy source is gonna be
A :  Yeah , certainly , of course .
A :  I think I think we decided that we're gonna for for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um , I you know , on the basis that um that , you know , if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years and that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years um .
D :  long term .
B :  Mm .
D :  Cool . Uh
B :  Yeah .
D :  And we're having a custom chip ?
A :  We're having a
A :  a custom chip , but given the the we've cut the functions down , um that will hopefully not be too problematic , but given that um technol technological innovation is important , then we need to , I'll say it again , technologically innovate .
A :  Um and uh we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um .
D :  And interchangeable case ?
A :  I i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept . Um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . And uh i you know , i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh I mean uh uh this is totally new . We d we don't know whether
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Mm , mm-hmm .
A :  that to what extent people do it or not , but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway , and uh and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , then uh you know , so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets , I won't mention any mention any names , um it's uh it's good for the supermarket and it's good for us and it hopefully makes them feel better .
D :  And uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or
A :  Um the that I mean that's no , because we've got so few buttons that it that actually makes that redundant .
C :  Yeah , I think so too . Yeah , and especially for making them so like different and
B :  Mm , does actually , yeah , yeah .
D :  Cool .
B :  Mm different to feel , yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah , yeah . And the you know , that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , 'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life , so no , I mean given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually uh uh unnecessary I think .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm . Yep , yeah . Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just
A :  As uh as wide cer certainly wider angle than than current , so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know , i i it will work most of the time um .
B :  Yeah .
D :  As wide as possible .
C :  Like this or like this .
B :  Mm yeah .
A :  Not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work .
A :  Um yeah , I mean I d I th I sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh .
C :  Yeah , kinda like this whole
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah , mm .
A :  Um so
C :  So you could use like this and it would go .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , 'cause I mean the r reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it , the chances are , so if if they're holding it anyway , the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it , then uh then that that's the sort of coverage that we want .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Um okay , d we're all clear where we go from here .
C :  Yep .
B :  Yep , sounds good .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay , so thank you very much indeed and I'll s see you all again in thirty minutes .
B :  'Kay .
C :  Okay .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Hi Kate . Okay , carry on . Alright um this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . Um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , I have the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . Um and we should each have a presentation to make . Um we have certain decisions to make and we have forty minutes total . It's twenty five after two at the moment , so forty minutes is five after three , um which I'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . Okay .
B :  Just just carry on .
A :  Um there are the decisions we have to turn to , but we'll come back to them in a minute after I take us to the
A :  minutes of the previous meeting .
A :  Right um as we remember , I opened the meeting , the four of us were present , the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed and approved . Um Sarah , you presented a marketing research report um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition .
A :  And then Steph did a second presentation um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . I think all of us agreed with those things . Kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half Pence cost . Um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries and having a docking place as a selling point . Um and the new requirements that it for be for T_V_ only um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . Um
A :  the corporate image .
A :  So we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . Alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the T_V_ , but it still should meet those parameters . Um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held .
A :  Um at that point we agreed that Sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . Um and Steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . Kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . And I was to type up these minutes and work on the final report .
A :  Is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right . So we're ready to close that and go back to our
A :  That one .
A :  Right . We're up to the point of the
A :  Go back .
A :  Um the three presentations . So we're going to pull the plug on me and turn to Sarah . Is that okay ?
A :  Is that alright with everybody else ? Especially since Kate asked to be last . Sarah , I'm sorry if I misspelled your name , I didn't know whether it was S_A_R_A_ or S_A_R_H_ .
C :  Yep .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I respond to either . No worries .
A :  You respond to whatever you get , huh ? Okay .
A :  Um , did you do your Hit
C :  Yeah ,
A :  Ah , there it is .
D :  Okay , first thing I want to address is um one of the points that Florence brought up , which was uh current cost of the competition devices , similar to the ones that Stephanie uh showed us and and they're uh twenty to sixty Euros , depending on uh branding . Some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . But I think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market . But I'm going to move on to more interesting um more vibrant things .
A :  Ta-da .
C :  Right .
A :  Mm 'kay .
D :  So , I investigated the remote control market in greater detail , and my uh the theme of what I was to work on was uh trend watch .
D :  And
A :  'Kay .
B :  Sorry . I'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on .
D :  I know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research , so you know , I'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . What's hot , fruit and veg .
D :  Spongy . And this is all over the catwalks , Paris , Milan , and I'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . This is really interesting change from past years , because it is much more organic , um some would say approachable . And I think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics
A :  Mm .
D :  and some of the bold colours into a simple
D :  handset . So . I also did a little research on um
D :  what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . Fancy . Functional is out . And f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , I'm I'm thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . This is twice as important as the next finding , which is technologically innovative . This is interesting , 'cause I think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . Ease of use . Again , pretty low , I mean it's the top three , but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . So
D :  I think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves .
B :  I think that's a good idea . Don't you ?
D :  Y yeah , you know
C :  Yes .
A :  It sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone .
D :  Exactly .
D :  Exactly . I was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . They could be ini initially I thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . Um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it . They could be interchangeable , they're spongy , that goes back to ergonomic , and the youngsters love 'em , fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . So what we're talking about is changing .
A :  Mm .
D :  this concept . Everyone has a T_V_ remote , but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . That's what's hot on the catwalks . So , this is my
D :  This is what I'm thinking .
A :  Hmm .
C : 
A :  Uh-huh mm .
A :  In most families , don't isn't the remote is a remote .
D :  Y yeah , but I think I think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it we all need a remote , but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , I'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers .
A :  Mm .
C :  So when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this .
D :  Yeah . W and plus I think
A :  Mm . Well actually some households do have three and four T_V_s and they would have a remote for each one , so .
D :  Uh yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . So this is an idea and I I you know , this is exactly what the research has uh has shown . So I really open this up to uh any other feedback . This spongy fruit and veg .
B :  Yeah , I I think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . Spongy is gonna be difficult , I'm afraid .
D :  Thanks .
D :  Alright .
C :  Yep .
A :  Hmm .
C :  And as for
A :  Hmm .
C :  as for um well budgeting as well , if we're gonna have lots of different interchangeable
D :  I I just have my ear to the market , guys .
C :  components . Is this to the market ?
B :  Yeah , I mean basically we can make these things out of wood , titanium , plastic or rubber . I suppose rubber is the closest to spongy , yeah .
D :  Is spongiest , yeah . That would add
B :  I was thinking titanium myself .
C :  I was thinking titanium , I was thinking it's just I have been influenced by pictures of iPods , and they're also minimalist and shiny .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  They are and they they would fulfil the uh first um priority , which is fancy . I think many of us would associate those with fancy . Something else we could do is uh
D :  call it something that's fruit and veg
D :  oriented . We could call it uh
D :  The name .
A :  Are we talking about the device itself or the c or a cover for the device that would be an interchangeable cov cover as a separate
A :  product ?
D :  Well it would be uh a a very simple product that would have a spongy sleeve that would be interchangeable . So
A :  Perhaps perhaps that desi that particular suggestion needs to go back to management and perhaps go to another group to actually design as a separate product .
C :  Yeah , but it's kind of pointless , isn't it ?
C :  Yeah .
D :  That , you know , that might be
C :  Let's delegate .
A :  Wo would that be agreeable ?
D :  And then we could keep it titanium .
B :  Yeah . W w would it be helpful if um I described the components a bit , because I think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to Earth of what we can actually physically do .
C :  Yeah , maybe . Or
A :  Do you wanna be next or you want Kate to go next ?
C :  I think possibly it might be more useful if Kate went next .
A :  Okay , we'll move the
C :  Um
C :  You can even have them in different flavours as well . So that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , yeah . Scratch and sniff .
D :  Yeah . Or s or smelly . Scratchy
D :  Uh well I was really thinking a lot about the I_ uh the iMac kind of gel gem tone . It's hot on the streets , guys .
B :  Right , well I I I think some of this um you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things I have to tell you , but I'm afraid this is the real world . So um
B :  I've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , and I've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , but I'm not sure that it's quite what you want um . Now this isn't a very good overhead , but this is just to show you , this is the innards of a remote control um . I really need a pen or something but uh does my mouse work ? No . Um oh yeah , can you see my little mouse pointer ? Right . This is this is the a a a remote that's been opened up and that's the the back of the interface .
A :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
B :  And this is a push-button one , so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons that go through onto the the board at the back and they push these buttons here . Um and we that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . We got to have something that pushes the little buttons that um talk to the chip that encodes the message that sends the the message to the receiver .
B :  So um I wan I wanna go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made , Sarah , but um doing my presentation in the order I wrote it . So first of all um I wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . Um we can have your bog standard double double A_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment .
B :  We can have a hand sorry a wind-up , yeah , which I think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . Um one that one that I think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device , which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . You have to it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work , but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , it'll work . Or we we had talked about solar power , but I thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark .
C :  A wind-up .
D : 
A :  Alright .
A :  Remember , we only have forty minutes
D :  Mm .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Now I'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . It can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium . Um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there I guess is rubber , but um
D :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm .
B :  I'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , but I think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Okay , what does the interface look like ? Um well push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . Um we can have scroll buttons and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , so you can have it like on a mouse where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that and push to
A :  Hmm .
B :  select something . Um you can have multiple scroll buttons , um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , but um it's it the technology is there . And we can also incorporate an L_C_D_ display in the remote , but this will increase the cost . Um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , and the price goes up as we choose each of this . If we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . All the other fancy interface designs go out the window , I'm afraid . Um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . If you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , but it that's what you need if you want the L_C_D_ display .
B :  And the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . Now I don't know what that is , but I think they think it's quite important and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . Um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , I have to say , but maybe you think that's old technology . And well I I think we've got two options . We can either go for a really cheap model , keep all of the costs down , um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . Or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , I think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , but um
D :  Mm .
B :  that may or may not be a good thing . Sorry . Um but it could have an L_C_D_ screen and it could have multiple scroll buttons , and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . So , thank you .
D :  That sounds good . Any idea you you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . Um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve Euros fifty ?
B :  Yeah , I'm afraid I don't have that information available . Um
B :  manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this , I'm afraid .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Hmm . Because , you know what , I'm being quite serious when I say that that um the things I mentioned are hot . But I think the important thing might be to choose one . You know , if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , we could call it , you know , Blackberry .
B :  Yeah mm-hmm .
D :  That's uh
C :  Bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , so what I had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it .
B :  Banana ?
D :  Alright , well let's see then .
C :  But um
C :  I I don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the Real Reaction company . It's just what I'd understood we'd be doing . That's before I heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But yeah , I'm trying to streamline mine a little bit .
B :  We we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , which would allow um say a banana , but um unfortunately I see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , we can't do anything fancier .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Shall we wait 'til I've 'til I've showed you what well , my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yep .
D :  Mm .
D :  Thank you , Kate .
A :  Thank you , Kate .
D :  Mm .
C :  You did seem to include just in more detail what I've got though . So so mine's a bit pointless .
C :  Right .
C :  F_N_ and F_ eight , did you say ?
A :  Yes .
A :  There we go .
C :  I don't have it on mine though .
D :  Oh I think um
D :  Florence resolved it by
B :  I If you do F_ uh F_N_ F_ eight again , it's it'll
A :  Do it again .
D :  F_ eight again .
A :  Keep doing it until you get it in both you get it there , you get it yours without that one , and then you get it with both .
B :  I think it yeah , you you will do an
C :  Should I do it again ?
D :  Maybe .
A :  Yeah .
A :  This time it should come up both .
C :  Right then . I don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what Kate says , just
A :  Okay .
C :  that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including M_P_ three players , uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . Uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones ,
A :  Mm .
C :  um what functions we actually need , and then how to group and arrange these on the actual
C :  the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . Uh I've been especially interested in the iPod style scroll wheel , which
C :  Well , I couldn't find a the picture of the iPod w only linked to a web browser , so I couldn't copy and paste it , but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . It has uh scroll wheels without without a display , but they they scroll like a computer mouse . So I was thinking that uh um a really simple
A :  Hmm .
B :  Hmm .
C :  a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen .
C :  Like I guess an existing
C :  Sky or cable one does . Like , you know , you press enter and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , and you can do you can scroll along and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , and you scroll up and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching
C :  the same channel on the screen .
C :  Uh but I'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote ,
D :  Mm .
C :  um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , but still quite simple and quite cost effective . So
C :  what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have
C :  a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , I mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , I was thinking , yellow and black , just because that's the company's colours , with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom instead of instead of having the iPod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . And when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing Sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . And uh and I definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . I mean titanium would be great , but I think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . If we're k trying to keep it
B :  Yeah , I'd I'd certainly support that idea .
C :  colourful and slightly organic , then I think titanium's too
C :  futuristic .
B :  It's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Uh then
B :  And the the having the the the screen on the television screen I think is a good idea , 'cause um otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting building the L_C_D_ in , but for the electronics as well .
C :  And it's a little bit pointless as well I think . Like when when when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy , just a little menu showing yeah , a menu , you go into one menu and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the
D :  It's a duplication .
B :  There is that .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  you know , your information about programme that's on at the moment . I don't think that's to taxing to uh
C :  s engineer . Um .
C :  But as for actually arranging them let me go back to the
C :  to the picture of the kiddie one .
C :  And I quite like it , 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held and it's got these easily reachable buttons that quite nicely uh spaced out , so something a bit like that with
C :  buttons arranged in a
C :  kind of circle . Up , down , left , right .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Do you want scroll buttons in that as well ?
C :  I I was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , but you know , a I can't quite d uh describe it . you see
C :  on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . Yeah , see where the mouse is , like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Right .
C :  And enter in the middle , so you pick your menu and then your different options and when when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that . I'm getting a bit uh specific here . Really we'd have to use something to show you , but
B :  Yeah . I think I think that's a g nice clean design , it's playing to our strengths which are in push button technology .
C :  If I don't think I can get it up on the screen . Ah here we go . Right .
D :  To uh m make it .
D :  Oh nice .
C :  Well , the iPod spinning wheel is uh really complicated . It does scroll , but it is hugely complicated . What else have we got ?
D :  Um Hmm .
A :  Huh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  Wow .
C :  Them , they're terrible . But they all have this this feature of this uh
C :  It's not quite a scroll wheel , but
A :  It's a selection wheel .
C :  it's a kind of selection in this circle , which I think is a really good idea .
B :  But we can implement it with simple push buttons , which is much cheaper .
C :  Yeah , like up , down , left and right .
C :  Which is good . And then and then
C :  Yeah , so I mean either a channel up and down , volume up and down ,
C :  next appearing programmes up and down , uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . So all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  And that's it .
B :  In fact
C :  Look at look at this one .
B :  Oh that's really nice .
C :  Almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . Might take up your whole living room .
D :  Do you think with um
D :  It seems that that uh you guys are quite keen on the plastic , perhaps the something reminiscent of the child's remote . Do you think we could put it in a in a fruit colour ?
D :  And have it abstract . You know , we could call like a fruit name , but it would be a little more abstract .
C :  Possibly . Yeah .
B :  Hmm .
B :  Mm . We we could actually do it in rubber instead of plastic if you'd rather if you feel if you like the spongy
C :  That also is possible .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Just
D :  I'm just just throwing out ideas .
A :  Or call it a or call it a banana and have it in yellow .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah . I'm thinking maybe we need to be a little bit more abstract if the
D :  design constraints are so
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh just something else I need to bring to your attention is have you have you seen these on a remote ? This is actually the volume up and down , but they both say V_ on them , which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , but it's actually the V_ to indicate that it's the volume , so
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Nice . Good point .
C :  But we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . If we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions .
A :  Mm 'kay .
C :  But then , that's complicated .
A :  I wanna thank you all for all your presentations . We have about ten minutes left , in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . Um and I think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . Um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . So let's
A :  Mm .
A :  Right .
A :  They want us to decide
A :  what form of energy are we going to use ,
A :  which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar .
A :  Um this is where Kate's expertise comes in , and our decision making will be a little bit guided by Kate at this point . The
A :  You were saying that the kinetic would be useful , that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . Um
A :  or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . That's the day you wanna use the T_V_ . Um so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ?
B :  Mm .
B :  Oh unfortunately I don't have costing information . I i in terms of workability , I I think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , but I'm sorry I don't figures on the difference in cost .
A :  Okay .
A :  Mm 'kay .
A :  What's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ?
D :  I've used kinetic in terms of watches and it's very very uh handy , you don't even notice
D :  um that it's there .
C :  It sounds great . I've never come across it before , but it sounds fantastic . Sounds like it could be g a really good economical it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient .
D :  It's
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  It could tie in with the fanciful design as uh , you know , throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving .
A :  Hmm .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah . 'Cause it's really a quite attractive thought , isn't it ? It's like yeah , a good selling point .
A :  So the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible .
C :  But it does depend how much
A :  It costs .
C :  I mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  And and how much you do have to keep it moving , 'cause I'm conscious that watching T_V_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm-hmm . But I could market that as a um as a a I was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know .
A :  Mm .
C :  Do your exercises while you're watching the T_V_ .
B :  Yeah .
B :  True , yeah , m more more environmentally friendly .
A :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah , that's what I was thinking as well .
D :  Mm-hmm . You know , kind of the
A :  Yeah .
A :  Thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . Um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision .
B :  Oh right , okay , I'd that that's something I maybe should have covered . Um
B :  chip on print is just a manufacturing technique um and I would certainly recommend it , I think , because I'm not sure I have an alternative .
A :  Oh .
A :  Okay .
B :  I i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper .
A :  What about the ca yeah . Oh , the way we uh-huh .
A :  Oh , okay .
A :  Um what about the case ?
A :  I think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , and I think we've discussed not having titanium . One , it's too expensive , um and second , it won't do this double um curves . Um we've sort of eliminated wood . We said plastic or rubber . What's the pleasure ?
B :  Well if if Sarah's keen on a spongy feel , the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , so it's yeah .
D :  That's exactly what I was thinking . I'm sold .
A :  What about you ?
C :  Do you not think it might need
C :  like a kind of
C :  a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy
D :  Mm .
D :  Kind of like an internal egg .
A :  Cover . Uh-huh .
C :  Yeah , s thick spongy cover , so it feels like the whole thing's spongy , but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it .
A :  Plastic inside .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Because I mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac
B :  Yeah . I'd I'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , but I agree , it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is .
C :  Yeah . Well you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them , and
A :  Hmm .
D :  And with sports on television .
A :  Okay .
D :  You know . I su
A :  Um the next part they want is the user interface concept . I'm sorry to push you , but we only have a couple minutes to finish with .
B :  I should I should r
D :  Then I'll just say I support either from a marketing point of view I support either decision that the designers make on that .
A :  Okay , and it says interface . What type and what supplements ?
C :  Just copy the one on the left . No um a scroll
C :  Well , like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen .
B :  Which I think technically is just push button and uh I'd certainly support that that that brings the cost down quite a lot and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on .
C :  Yeah , I'd like push buttons with
C :  So push buttons
A :  Okay , um
A :  that's that .
A :  Um this is gonna sound weird , but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . Whew . And they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , you can look and see this as well as I can . Marketing they want product evaluation . Oh . Oh my , I'm sorry .
C :  No , it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually .
D :  No we can't , actually .
D :  That's why I was looking over your shoulder
A :  Oh , okay . Sorry about that . missed that one .
A :  This ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . Ah , ta-da .
C :  Now it's gone again .
A :  Ah .
B :  You know , I think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately .
A :  Yes , because I can't even see mine . Next meeting starts in thirty minutes , these are the individual actions . Yeah , right . Um the look and feel design is for Kate , uh Steph gets the user interface design , you get product evaluation . Um the two of you get to play with a Pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . Uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . Anything else we need to do ?
C :  Oh yes .
D :  Mm .
C :  Great .
D :  Sounds good .
C :  I don't think so .
A :  Go to it .
C :  Play-Doh .
A :  And that's the end of this meeting .
A :  That's for her benefit .
D :  That's really all I got , guys .
A :  Okay .
A :  Right .
A :  Conceptual design meeting . Right . Okay , so
A :  Right well um from the last meeting I was trying to send you the minutes , but uh it didn't work out too well , so maybe in sort of um
A :  quick summary of the last uh meeting , I can
A :  quickly give you
A :  what we what we had . Uh right , so
A :  Wishing I hadn't closed the damn Right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . We had uh made our decisions about uh
A :  made our decisions about uh
A :  the device itself , that it was gonna be simple to make it uh
A :  enable us to complete the project in time . We're gonna have uh effectively two pages , a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted , and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh
A :  meet the technical requirements . And the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , only as and when required . So .
A :  So basically what decisions uh have we uh made ? Uh have there been any uh changes ?
B :  I think we all have a presentation again , so if we go through those and then um
A :  Right .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Three presentation , yeah . So Yeah , fine .
B :  . Shall I go first again ?
D :  Okay .
B :  I see this a little more smoothly than the last one .
B :  Okay right , let's get started . Um
B :  basically the uh for the Um I'll back actually .
B :  For the components design , um next step is basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . We still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . Then there is a chip and still the sender . So um yes including the power s supply as well . Um I'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . Uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery ,
B :  um . There's a dynamo . Any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up um . There's a kinetic option , which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced .
B :  Um that's one option , but I think that was gonna cost a little more . And then there's solar cells . Um as a final option . For the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , which is Oh just to say all all these are um supplied by Real Reaction . So I guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . Um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , which I guess is just the same as the standard ones . This says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer . Um there's a scroll wheel
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , which may be for the volume . You could do do that . Um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , so we have to take that into consideration . Um moving on to the printed s
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  What would be the cost do do we know ?
B :  Um that's on the next I th I think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , but it does affect the printed circuit board . Um which is the next section . Basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote . The firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . And there's different prices according to each . So if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . There's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . Um and I guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , so there is an extra price in that sense . There is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . Um going to my personal preferences , um I thought possibly for power we could use kinetic um which is the idea of the watches um that you move you move the remote around to power it up . And this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . Um for the buttons , I thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel .
B :  Um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . So if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . And that's it .
D :  'Kay .
A :  with the printed circuit boards you were going for the
C :  Thanks .
B :  Um i it kind of depends um if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . I'm guessing . Uh but I don't know , so that is something I'll have to look into .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  But are we going f R right .
B :  Um that's a that's a decision for all of us . Um .
A :  So are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue , so would it not be best to rather than I mean one way is to do each of the presentations and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . The other way would be to do the presentation and then make the decision at that point in time .
B :  Yeah yeah .
B :  We decide . Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um . Maybe w
C :  Yeah , that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away .
A :  'Cause at that point then you've got the details up there , so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . Then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time and then that would be the end of that issue . Does that make sense ?
B :  Um .
B :  Yes .
C :  Um I have a lot of the information there . It might not be very clear .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Is there
C :  Unless you want to plug it back in to yours .
B :  Um .
B :  We could do , yeah . Um yeah we should .
B :  As I say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , it didn't The voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . Um .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  No the scroll wheel required the regular , so the
B :  Yeah if if you down um .
A :  Hmm .
B :  It's just this bit at the bottom which I've highlighted , but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , which is in the higher price range .
A :  Okay . The display requires an advanced chip the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense .
C :  I think the scroll wheel um
B :  Also the display's for something else which we decided against . Um but that bit
A :  Okay .
B :  And note that the push button just requires a simple chip , so that would keep the price down .
A :  Down .
C :  Yeah , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , I think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ? I I've got um pictures well I've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it , and they don't really look great .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Right . Okay .
B :  'Kay .
B :  So maybe just a simple push button , and that would cut costs on the
A :  So . So we're going for p Okay . So is um
D :  So are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ?
C :  Yeah , a simple pushbuttons .
A :  Simple push button .
D :  Okay .
B :  Did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? The um it was basically what we said before , the idea that you record in a set
B :  message , and then it picks up that message um and replies to you . So it is basically the concept we discussed before . Um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . I'm guessing it would , but got like the definite information . Maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? Or are we going for the regular ?
B :  Um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board .
A :  Mm-mm . But is there any other I mean okay , that's true for the for for that element , but we have to take all el elements into consideration . And so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . S
D :  Mm .
C :  Hmm . But
D :  I suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we m make a decision .
C :  But the way that I interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , it just it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message . So I don't think it would effect our circuit board .
A :  Right .
D :  Oh yeah , I suppose so , yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So maybe that would be something separate , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  No .
B :  Okay , so we'd have a simple circuit board and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . Oh that makes sense .
C :  Yeah . And I don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . 'Cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning Jo . It might be useful to say like where are you remote . Here I am , Jo . But I think that's maybe as far as that one could go ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-mm .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah that makes sense , so we'd stick with the simple circuit board and then think of the speech recognition as an extra
D :  Yeah .
B :  an extra possibility .
C :  Yeah , just as a fun way to find it .
B :  Okay . Um .
A :  Simple circuit board . Simple push button .
A :  Okay . W w kinetic . You were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply .
C :  And it says that I think it said the cost of that isn't too much .
B :  Um yeah I I thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries .
A :  Mm-hmm . And how does it get uh charged up ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um .
B :  It's um I think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside . It's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up . Somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . So you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit and then that powers it up to use it .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . So the speech recognition was Are we going for speech recognition ? No ? 'Cause that required the advanced
D :  Yeah .
C :  Um I think it would be helpful to find it , but I don't think it'd um
D :  Just
B :  Uh yeah I think did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected
C :  Yeah , I think so .
D :  Just just for the call and find thing .
B :  It was just
A :  I had speech recognition requires advanced req require
B :  Oh no th that's what that's what I thought , but maybe maybe it doesn't .
A :  Oh . So okay . Speech recognition you reckon then is s simple . And so we would want it in as an extra because it doesn't appear to cost too much . Would that be
B :  Um I think I might have got that wrong .
D :  'Cause it's s it's separate isn't it , it's not part of the
B :  It's it's just an addition thing it's um yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  'Kay shall I pass on to you now ?
C :  I think
A :  In fact , it wouldn't really cost anymore , would it ?
C :  I'll just just check what it said .
C :  Actually I don't think it really says anything about the cost , but it says that it's already in the coffee machines , so
D :  Yeah .
C :  like it's already kind of
B :  I assume it would cost extra , but
B :  Maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later .
A :  And then have to change all change everything at the last minute .
A :  Okay . S
C :  Um .
C :  Oh , that was quick . Um okay , so very brief presentation , um .
C :  From looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy . Um I haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , um but there's some curved cases that you can see , uh a range of sizes uh . All of them have a lot of buttons there um they seem to just have the rubber buttons .
C :  Does that move it ?
A :  Sorry ?
C :  It just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything .
A :  Yeah , I've found that try and get it back .
B :  If you right click and then go onto a previous slide .
C :  Ah it's alright . Um . There wasn't much more to say about that , just rambling . Um some of the uh remotes that I looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um
B :  Okay , right .
C :  where it was connected to the remote control functions . And uh it was quite uh a swish model , where it can control uh four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , video , D_V_D_ , audio . Um so that's a bit of competition there . So
C :  I mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing and just to market it as a completely different um
C :  like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control rather than trying to compete with the functions . Um the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , um
B :  Yeah , yeah .
C :  there's examples of those , but they don't look as sleek as other models . And there's no real advantage and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great . Um
B :  On the price , yeah .
A :  So you were saying the scroll buttons
C :  Yeah . Th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um .
C :  There was children's remote , where um they just had a very limited range of buttons and they were b uh bright and colourful and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um but I don't know if that's really in our field ? But that's something that's out there .
B :  I guess I guess we're going for the biggest market , maybe not , but
B :  Was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ?
A :  Well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude The one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications . So you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , and then you could have additional features in you know like a You'd have model one , model two and model three , and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . But that's really where your field is .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step , but maybe I dunno for ours , maybe we should
A :  Anyway you could add on for an extra package , but on this basic one I'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay . Right well that's something that we can be aware of .
A :  Is that So so what are we deciding to do here ?
C :  Um .
C :  I think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function .
A :  Right .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh the fi Yeah , the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote . Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition .
C :  Oh yeah .
B :  S s so um
C :  Different languages might not be compatible .
B :  Yeah , yeah . It w it would make it quite complicated , where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple and then the
A :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , 'cause I think you program um this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah and ours is quite a cheap device , so I don't know how much we'll be able to put into it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature . And you were talking
C :  Hmm . Maybe unless something else comes up .
A :  Mm . And you were talking about scroll buttons ?
C :  Um yeah I think um I think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost and give no real kinda extra benefit and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it .
A :  Okay . b
B :  Yeah .
A :  Alright , so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons , was that right ?
B :  Yes yes .
C :  Hmm um and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote .
A :  Okay . So not to be focused on .
C :  Yeah . Um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design . Um just to avoid ambiguity . So it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a V_ on for volume ,
C :  Um let's think how they did this .
A :  Good in in Flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down . An upside-down V_ .
C :  I'm just gonna check so I do this right .
C :  Um . What did they say ?
A :  So that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down .
C :  Um I think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , and that's the first thing that they see
A :  Right .
C :  Actually that can't be right , can it ? Oh well , no , they might see
C :  yeah , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down , whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So , be careful what you put on the buttons and be careful of the shape that you make them , because they might be kind of two um
B :  So maybe we could have like
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  contradicting kind of shapes .
B :  Yeah I I know what you mean . So maybe we could have volume written on the side and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves .
A :  Yeah . You could have volume up and volume Volume up , down and Like that . And 'cause the idea was to have limited um it was to have sizable amount of information on it . Limited number of buttons . 'Cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were
C :  Yeah .
B :  Possible .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah we got it down to not too many .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Um and I think that's all I had to say for that .
D :  Okay .
C :  Um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button ?
B :  Um
B :  Are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , or are we gonna t
D :  I've I've got some things to say about possible design things from
B :  Yeah , maybe we should see yours first .
C :  Oh okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  trend watching .
D :  Cool .
D :  Right , um I've been looking at some trends
D :  in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market the the one that's the one I talked about last time , that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . And we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . So we've had people in Paris and Milan watching the uh fashion trends . So
A :  You know yourself .
D :  So just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . The most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . And second , there should be some technological innovation . And then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well .
B :  'Kay .
D :  And apparently , the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . Um but um the feel of the material should be spongy , which is contrary to last year , apparently . I presume it must have been not not spongy last year . So
D :  we need to emphasise the fancy design with on on our remote control above all else . And then also try and add in technological informat innovation which could be our sort of find the thing with a hand clap . And then we need to ma sort of make it easy to use that's as a third priority , so perhaps um fewer fewer buttons and functions as we've as we've discussed . And then maybe find a way to incorporate these trends so that we sort of capture people's imaginations .
D :  So maybe we could make the buttons shaped like fruit and veg , or the the buttons could be spongy , uh somehow . Maybe we could make them out of rubber rather than sort of hard plastic . And then sort of even wackier than that , we could maybe have a fruit or vegetable shaped remote , say in the shape of a banana or something like that .
D :  Right , so that'll be it . Maybe a banana or courgette or something .
D :  How how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , or or you know , do they not matter that much ?
C :  I think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use .
A :  Well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , 'cause you're can mis-direct people . And I would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera , so .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  .. .
C :  Maybe just one button , say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . Maybe that could be a little apple .
D :  Maybe yeah .
A :  Okay . Now ? Yeah . Stand-by button . No th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality .
C :  And then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine , and it wouldn't confuse the numbers .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well I dunno I I guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are , maybe
A :  But what are they gonna be next Yeah . What are they gonna be next year . But but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr If y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh I was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever . That means you're constantly changing your production schedule , and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else , so that's not a good idea I would I would suggest .
D :  Yeah yeah .
C :  Hmm . S
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , I'm not
D :  Yeah .
D :  I'm not I'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is . I don't know .
B :  I mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in
B :  those kinds of fashion trends . to something which is maybe more universal .
D :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  But I suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design , um even if the design kind of changes ,
A :  Well
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  We c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Ah d d But if Mm-hmm . Well . Yep .
B :  Maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um .
B :  Maybe still with a rubber design we could
A :  Was that in the sort of fashion sense that this Or was the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion ? It was , wasn't it ? So the
D :  Yeah .
C :  It seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um .
C :  And that you can make them curved or double-curved and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look .
B :  Oh yeah yeah one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Oh right , that fits , doesn't it ?
B :  Um oh no no no sorry it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . That's the way round . If you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it .
B :  Which makes sense .
C :  Right .
B :  Um .
A :  Rubber buttons require rubber case .
C :  And that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Uh so , yeah . The m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? 'Cause in essence in the production you want things to stay you want to basically mint them out 'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do . Whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . You're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that , and especially 'cause then you could make it something that
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  I suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual would or not .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well , you might be limited in space , that yes . Well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is Plasticine .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Yes yes .
B :  Maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions like the Nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . But whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , whether that would just increase the costs , make it more complicated .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Hmm . So you're talking there about uh changing
D :  That's possibly it .
A :  changing the casing .
B :  Yeah the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , so where the buttons would stay the same , and the general function of the remote would stay the same , but you could change the the way it looked .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah and then you could have Oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that .
B :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  Yeah you you could do a colour change , so therefore you would yeah yeah I mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in rather than all in black or , you know , which four do you want , as long as it's black ? But uh so
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
B :  So it is a possibility , um .
C :  But we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme , aren't we ? We haven't really seen that yet
A :  Yes oh that's true uh that might no
B :  Oh okay yes that is
D :  Yeah .
C :  It might and we might be able to do both but it might clash with certain things .
A :  Well not necessarily , because you could have your company uh We're we're meant to be finishing up . You could have your company badge and logo . I mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , you know , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it so that uh in a sense , with a with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  'Cause you you know you're sort of you're badging it . And in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top . And in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the uh the Windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product . So .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
B :  And whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases
B :  might be something to consider .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well if it's for young people , um like the phone generation , that sort of thing'd probably go down well , and the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , I mean it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing but I'm
D :  Yeah . I'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . I think with the mobiles ,
D :  it's the , you know it's a communication device , people see you with it all about and
B :  Yeah I suppose , where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time .
D :  i if it
A :  It's uh in in the house , isn't it , I suppose .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , so if we just went for one colour of a rubber case
D :  I think
A :  So don't change case . Change case colour . And we're sort of saying no to that .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Did we decide on the rubber case ? The spongy feel , or did we think that that might go as a trend ?
D :  Well , it was different last year . The trend was different last year apparently . It was not not spongy feel .
D :  But
D :  I don't know whether the trend will change . I don't know whether it's one of those things that
D :  like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , less likely to
A :  Sounds reasonable .
D :  y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know .
A :  If you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases so that you could or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case .
B :  So then th th that would
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , and then have the standard rubber buttons as well .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
C :  Uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case . There's flat , there's single-curved and there's double-curved .
B :  Um .
B :  Um .
C :  I'm not exactly sure what these things look like .
B :  Maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? But the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the Plasticine .
C :  Well it says that
D :  When you say d when you say double-curved , what what exactly does that mean ?
C :  I'm not exactly sure . Um I'll show you
D :  Okay .
C :  the remotes that I've got . See how uh
C :  Let's just get that bigger .
C :  See how uh the one Oh I'm not plugged in , am I ? That doesn't help . Shall I just turn it round for time ?
D :  No you're not connected to me anymore .
A :  One one thing to cons one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other . Whereas if you do um fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that . And the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product .
D :  That should come up .
D :  Mm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah yeah . So shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , if we have to kind of
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  So but
D :  Yeah .
C :  Um it's not very clear up there , but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges , like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there . I'm not exactl I don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ?
A :  No .
A :  Mm yep .
D :  Right .
D :  That's what I was trying to work out .
C :  But um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there .
A :  Oh right .
A :  S so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ? We're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so .
D :  Shall we
C :  Definitely a single , maybe a double .
C :  Shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  'Kay , so shall we quickly
B :  We'll go for single curve , yeah . Single curve .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay , curved or double curved ? So it's single curved .
B :  So did we did we decide on the kinetic power supply ? The one you move around ? Okay . Um
D :  Yeah I think that think that's a good idea .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
C :  And the rubber push buttons , rubber case .
D :  Rubber
D :  Rubber buttons and case .
C :  Um and we don't really know much about the colour scheme or logo yet do we , but possibly a sticker .
B :  Oh we ca Yeah yeah , we'll still have the Are we gonna go for the simple circuit board just to keep the cost down ? I th I think we can by by not having anything too complicated .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah and and the voice recognition , we can use that can't we , just to find it .
B :  Um .
D :  Yeah yeah .
A :  Yes . Yep .
B :  Um .
C :  Without affecting the circuit board .
B :  And see we could always decide against it if something comes up that's just something to that we seemed to leave out .
D :  Okay . And then are we going for sort of one button shaped like a fruit . Or veg .
C :  Yeah that sounds like it wouldn't do too much harm in a couple of years . Uh what sort of shape do we want ?
D :  Don't know , maybe just
A :  So we've got spongy feel buttons as well , have we ? As well as or w or was that
D :  Yeah .
D :  That's ru rubber buttons , yeah .
B :  Yeah , it was just
A :  So it's rubber buttons , so it's not really spongy feel buttons , it's just rubber buttons . With a rubber case right ?
B :  'Kay .
D :  Yeah . Reasonably spongy I guess , yeah .
C :  Yeah , so it's not too wacky .
A :  And the standby button is gonna be different .
D :  Yeah okay .
C :  Um I think an apple would be a good recognisable shape . If you start getting into kinda aubergines and things , it gets a bit weird .
A :  Okay so what what shape are we making the standby button ? A apple . Oh oh Sorry ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  Apple ?
C :  Vote ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Shall we vote on it ? Anyone got any suggestions ? Right .
D :  Yeah . Apple apple a a qu Quite a big one , as well . A big apple . Uh
B :  We will go for the a a a apples apples .
C :  Okay . Ah . Well it could be red .
D :  Could be a red apple , yeah .
D :  Either , don't mind .
A :  A red apple ? Is it ?
C :  Yeah 'cause we wanna incorporate a bit of colour if we can , once we find out um
B :  Okay . And then we're gonna are you gonna work on keeping the button design quite simple ? Just like the
B :  Just working out what we're gonna do for the next time .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah that seems pretty straight forward . 'Cause most of them will just be kind of mainly circular or like very plain .
B :  Yeah .
B :  'Kay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
A :  Sorry what was that last thing again there ?
C :  Uh just to keep the shape of the buttons simple .
A :  Right much option on that . I thought you were going for a single curve and
C :  Ah just the uh shape of the buttons .
A :  Alright .
B :  And j yeah , just keeping the sort of the labelling them labelling of them fairly simple as well . Fairly sort of self explanatory .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Right , so shape of buttons simple .
A :  Okay . So that's that , I guess . We should now go away and get these things sorted out . I guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever . Okay , so um .
B :  Okay .
B :  Is that the end ? Okay .
D :  Looks like it .
A :  Okay .
A :  Is everyone ready to start ? Okay . Great . Well , welcome to the third meeting of conceptual design . I'll just get the PowerPoint presentation up and running .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
A :  Okay . Um , on the agenda for this , um , for this particular meeting , we'll have your three presentations on what you've done since our last meeting , after we came up with um some general ideas of our design . And , um , then we have to make some key decisions on , on our remote control concept , and how we're gonna make it , what uh materials we're gonna use , and that sort of thing . The meeting will be forty minutes long . And um we will once again have Poppy as our first presenter . Alright , and I will switch up PowerPoint .
B :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
B :  Thank you .
A :  Okay .
B :  Should be just loading .
B :  Okay . Oh , although I can't see it on my screen .
B :  That says go here .
B :  Okay . I've been doing some research into the different components that we could use , um what's available to us f to actually make the remote control . Um , first of all we have to look at how the remote control is actually made , and what is it happens inside the casing , which is more your field . Um , thes main internal feature is a circuit board , which contains all the elec electronics and also the contacts with the power source . Which is not necessarily a battery , as we're about to see . Um , there are several components of , um , the circuit board that we need to consider , where we'll be getting them from , what they'll be made of . Um , including the integrated circuit , which is also known as the chip . Which is where all the main information is uh contained . Um , diodes , transistors , resonators , resistors , and capacit capacitors all need to be considered as well . Um , and all their positioning in the circuit .
A :  Um
A :  Are they all included , like mandatorily , or r are these different options ?
B :  Uh , these , they're all different options , they're all separate , apart from the chip , which we will probable decide whether we buy a simple , a regular , advanced . We can go into that later . Um , all the other things are individual components that we'd have to get in separately , and work out the most , like , effective um circuit , including all the wires and everything like that . And the L_E_D_ of course , that's a light emitting diode . So , we could , so we've got flex flexibility with colours and things , with that as well .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
B :  Okay , there are lots of different possibilities for the energy source . We could use a basic battery , but that brings with it , like they need to be recharged and the bulk , the size of it as well . And they're not so great to dispose of , environmentally . There's a hand-powered dynamo which is a sort of thing that was used for torches fifty years ago . A bit out of date . Kinetic energy is something that's been recently developed .
A :  Um
A :  What is a hand-powered dynamo ?
B :  Um , where you manually charge up the power . Like you wind up something . Sorry ? Yeah . Every once in a while I think . But it's
A :  Just every , every once in a while ?
A :  Just every once in a while or constantly ?
A :  Alright . It'd be kind of strange to always be cranking it I think .
B :  Yeah . It would be like going a step back in time . I don't think it would really be with kind of cutting edge technology . Whereas kinetic energy is a new idea that's being used by some watches and other devices , where you just shake the device and it gives it power . I mean , the kinetic energy is transformed into power to make the circuit work . Um , or there's solar power , which we've been considering inside a building , which is where it's gonna be used , might not be quite so useful . But , good to look into , renewable energy , always the way .
C :  Yeah .
A :  No .
A :  Right .
B :  Um , lots of considerations for the case , like what sort of shape it would be , curved or flat . That's got a lot to do with the ergonomics . Like how it's comfortable and s sits in the hand . We don't want something that's huge and you can't pick up . Or too small . Or too slidy . I know I've had a remote control before which you couldn't tell which was the front and the back , 'cause it had so many buttons on , and the shape was so symmetrical that I'd be pressing like a volume button instead of the on button . Because you can't really see which way round it is .
D :  Mm .
A :  Right .
B :  Um , we also can choose what materials um , the we could use metal , we could use rubber which might be more um ideal for the anti-R_S_I_ . It's like the same sort of rubber that's used in stress balls and things like that , so it's very like soft , not so stressful on your hands . Wood . Um , again , stepping back in time again there . I don't think that's quite up to date with what we're looking for here . Um , titanium is not gonna be possible , even though it just it beyond our budget really . But , would've been maybe for future projects .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um right our choice for buttons as well . We've developed some we've got some good advances in technology , with our research team have found some uh new multiple um option scroll buttons . I think that was brought up for , um , they're basically quite a flexible design , modern , you don't have to use individual buttons . You can just slide up and down . I'm sure we're all quite familiar with those on mobiles or computer laptop pads .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um one thing with the scroll buttons though . It , it we would have to have an L_C_D_ um
B :  Yeah . That's true . And that would lead to an advanced yeah . If we have yeah . We're going on to that later with the advanc with the L_C_D_ that means we'd need a really advanced chip . And it's unlikely that that's gonna be in our budget . Um , also we've got the integrated pushbutton , which is what we're most familiar with . It's the most straightforward . But you can in like incorporate that with a scroll button as well . . Got decisions to make there . And this is what I was just saying before . Linked in the different depends on what type of buttons we have and the inputs . Um simple would go with the pushbutton .
A :  display , and the glow in the dark thing
A :  might be difficult .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um , regular you could link with the scroll button . And the advanced we'd have to go with a L_C_D_ s display . My personal preferences ? I think we could go for the kinetic energy source . I don't , I think that's quite um an advanced kind of technology . It's not been seen before , so it could be quite a , a novelty factor , attractive as well . And also energy saving 'cause you're producing the energy , you don't need an external sort of battery supply or solar panels . You just give it a shake . Sounds brilliant to me .
A :  Right .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Rubber casing I thing would probably the best , if we're going for the anti-R_S_I_ and like more choice with um aesthetics . Like it could be pretty much any colour we want . Um , and gives you , yeah , more flexibility there . And probably the regular chip as opposed to the simple , then we could possibly have the scroll and the push , but no L_C_D_ , 'cause we probably can't afford that one .
A :  Uh .
A :  Yeah . Um , one concern with the rubber casing is that it would be rubber encapsulating all of these chips and diodes and delicate technology as
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  like as the exterior . This is the one thing that's protecting its innards .
B :  I think that would , uh there would be an in sort of more internal casing . And the rubber would just be the , what's in contact with the human . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Another thing is it might be more difficult if it's a rubber exterior talking about putting on interchangeable plates . Um , is it I don't see how a like a rubber plate going on top it would stay there . Like if it was sort of like a clip-on plastic plate . It would work that way .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Maybe if the , um , if it was just kind of a , more of a rubber coating which was on to a case . So , it was kind of , the whole thing would be removable .
C :  Like plastic with rubber , kind of on top
B :  Yeah . Like I can't think of what .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well , there's , there is a certain phone that has like a rubber casing , b like a Nokia it is . It's yeah .
B :  Yeah . Or like an you can get sort of outer casing for iPods and something , that's just it's protective as well . It , it stops it , I mean , it would reduce the impact if it was dropped or something , as well , 'cause it wouldn't damage itself so easily . I think i maybe a mixture of both there , maybe . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Like the skin ? Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . So maybe the
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So the actual remote would be hard plastic and the casings rubber . Okay . And the buttons obviously are rubber .
B :  And then yeah . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  That sounds good . I , um , is it possible to put designs onto this type of rubber ?
B :  As far as I know . It should be .
A :  Okay , we'll just say yeah . Yes , just why not . Alright . I like the kinetic energy source idea . Um , I don't know when people will , um , be moving a remote around a lot . But I think that it's worth it , kinetety , kinetic um
B :  Yeah . Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah . I thought that was
C :  Yeah , tha
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  energy source . It could make an we could have any kind of style . It wouldn't be as heavy or bulky , and
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Just for environmental reasons .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I guess it's a bit scary 'cause it hasn't been done before .
B :  Yeah .
D :  So it seems we'd have to do more research on it . Or I dunno if you could have a battery pack .
B :  Yeah . Like as a backup for something .
C :  Backup . Yeah .
D :  Yeah so there's there is a one battery , because most remotes use two batteries I believe . So , if it was running off of one battery as a
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  That would be good yeah .
B :  Yeah . Some alternative just in case something went wrong .
D :  Right .
C :  Maybe we could you were saying about um solar power ma maybe not working indoors , but a lot of calculators , yeah , have solar power . So maybe that could be incorporated as
B :  That's true . I just thought of that . Yeah . Yeah . May maybe that could be the backup . Instead of a battery . Like solar backup .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Although it needs some light , doesn't it ?
B :  Yeah . I suppose s but some
C :  Do , do those calculators yeah .
A :  Yeah , you can watch a T_V_ in the dark then .
D :  So , if we're doing yeah . If we're
B :  But thing is , it's not you don't need the solar all the time . It can be stored . It can be like you can have the solar energy and then it can store that energy and use it . It just needs to be in light for a certain amount of time per day . Like a few hours a day . .
C :  I don't know how it works .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think that might be a little impractical though .
D :  Yeah . I think sometimes it's just shoved under , under a cushion , and yeah .
B :  That's true . It could easily
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Like people don't wanna have to worry about that .
B :  Yeah . I suppose it would be really annoying if you get to think , oh no , I forgot to charge my remote today . Like if the kinetic thing , I think what's best about that is that it's instant energy . You don't have to , you know , you can shake it a few times , or whatever . And it works . Yeah . Instead of you don't have to like make sure it's in the right place to charge and .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Or just like pick it up when you're gonna use it .
C :  Yeah , I suppose .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright . Cool .
B :  K okay .
A :  'S that the end of your presentation . Alright . Thank you .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  There we go .
C :  Thanks .
C :  Oh .
C :  It's not on my screen . Why ?
B :  it wasn't on mine either . I don't know why . I think , I just , I just used the mouse on there .
C :  You don't know why ? Oh okay .
C :  Is it that one ?
A :  Yeah . That's um
B :  Yeah .
C :  Um , I'm just gonna go through the interface concept with yous now . Uh , first of all I'll explain what a user interface is . It's the aspects of a computer system which can be seen or otherwise perceived , for example , heard or felt maybe , or by the human user .
C :  And it's also the commands that the user uses to control its operation and to input data .
C :  Um , there are two types of user interfaces . There's the graphical user interface , which emphasises the use of pictures for output and a pointing device , for example a mouse for input control . So that's sort of like the scroll thing we were talking about .
A :  Oh . Okay . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I'm not really sure about the pictures that maybe that's on an L_C_D_ screen . Or maybe it's
B :  Mm .
C :  the the buttons or pictures or something .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah . So I suppose sometime after you .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , 'cause I'm sorry ? Um , because command interface requires you to type textual commands and input at a keyboard , so the numbers are sort of like a keyboard . You're pressing the numbers for , um , for what you want .
C :  Do you think it's
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
C :  So you must , for the graphical user you must need some kind of presentation for the graphics . Like an L_C_D_ screen .
B :  I s I suppose where um mm on some buttons you would have like the power would be s some kind of symbol . And if you wanted to go onto teletext or , I know we're not having that , but I mean a similar thing , you , they have there's a like little picture with a screen with lines across it , which I suppose it's that sort of thing like the , the symbol on the button . But if we're having a simplified display anyway , w that , we probably won't have to focus so much on that . It'll be more the on the numbers and the volume .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , we'll be doing
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . It'd be more a command interface , and then
C :  Yeah .
B :  I suppose we need to think of symbols for like the volume , display , and stuff like that .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So it's just draf graphical for the pointing aspect ?
D :  The infrared is like , that's considered a
B :  I
A :  Hmm ?
C :  No I think it's to do with the actual symbols that are on the , that's on the buttons of the remote control , and per
D :  Okay . So when it says pointing device that doesn't include
B :  For inp
C :  Well it could be a wee scroller thing , and something could come up on the screen .
A :  Yeah . I think they're talking about L_C_D_ type things .
B :  Mm .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  But um
C :  I think we're gonna go with the command interface anyway , to make it more simplistic . But the , we could incorporate some of the graphical user um points , as in just to make it m um nicer to look at maybe .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  What do you mean ?
C :  Like I can't think of an example , but
C :  Sort of like little pictures rather than
A :  Oh yeah , like how the buttons
C :  Like a little sound . Instead of saying volume , like a little speaker or something . Yeah , something y
A :  Yeah , as a button though . So , it's a keyboard in the shape of it , right ? Okay . Yeah . I like that idea .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah m perha yeah . Yeah . Maybe .
C :  Um , the co uh we've decided that the command interface would be the most useful for a remote control . As it would be less complicated , and the controls would be more user-friendly .
C :  Um , the remote control would be cheaper to design , so that we'd have more money in the budget to , um , target the design area of the interface . You know , make it more trendy and original . We'll have more money if we keep it simple .
A :  Yeah . I'm sure i like kinetic energy would probably dip into the budget .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  A bit more too , yeah .
C :  Seeing as it's quite a new technology . Um
C :  We , we also have to keep in mind when we're designing our , um , more user-friendly remote control , that a lot of interfaces consist of a clutter of buttons , that , um , that their functions , colours and forms aren't always helpful .
B :  Yeah . That's true . That's in like the buttons with all the different like colours for different choices and things . It can be a bit , yeah , overwhelming .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And that all interfaces are different . So , um , that doesn't improve the use of the produ product , so we need to come up with something that's easy to understand .
C :  And maybe learn from the mistakes of other interfaces that can be too complicated for people to use .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yep .
C :  Does anyone have any questions ?
A :  Do you think that we should keep all the buttons to one same colour , just to keep it , give it a simplistic look .
C :  Mm .
D :  I think if we go with the um design plate thing , we'll have to . Just because of colour clashing , and if we wanted to , so and , and we might , I mean , depending on what comes out of the design , we might have to stick to just black buttons .
A :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  But um
A :  But what about the lighting up effect ?
D :  You mean different colours for the lighting or
A :  Um , well , um , I thought we had um decided that we would if you touched one of the buttons they'd all light up . And so if they were black , it wouldn't be possible for them to light up .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh I see what you're saying .
D :  Well y
A :  If they were white they would glow , probably . If they were made out of rubber .
D :  Oh so you're picturing the light is coming from the back . I kinda pictured it as kind of coming from the sides and lighting it up frontwards .
B :  Oh .
D :  But , but I guess , you mean from the back . Okay .
A :  Oh . Where would the light come from ?
B :  I'd assume , like , an internal light , that comes through . So there would have to , have to be some parts maybe transparent around the buttons , or something .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Right .
A :  Yeah , and well rubber is a more translucent product too , so we have that taken care of .
B :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It should be able to mm-hmm .
C :  In the phone that I was thinking of as well , when you change the um covers of it , the , the little buttons that actually , you know , that contro control stuff , are behind the rubber . So you can change the buttons when you're changing the faces . Do you know what I mean ? 'Cause it's just the wee control , yeah , thing that's behind it .
B :  Li yeah .
D :  Oh . Yeah . They , they insert over .
A :  Oh .
D :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  So
C :  I mean , we don't have to decide on one colour . Each face could have its own colour of buttons maybe ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well , if they're raised up buttons . So that you can feel them . We were talking about it being more
C :  Yeah .
A :  um , a lot more tangible . Um , it might be more difficult to do . If they're , if they're sticking up . If it's flat then , like o like on a cellphone or a mobile phone , it's like all very flat , and you just have to sort of press down on these tiny little buttons , but
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  I think it would be possible . I don't think it would make that much difference . I mean , the uh the dimensions of it . 'Cause if it's just like constructed in the same way as like the front cover of a mobile phone . You can like take off the hard cover and then there's the like say the buttons . And then you get to the circuit . I don't think it would matter that the buttons were bigger through the , the top casing . I'm sure you could f work it out to fit in the casing , without causing too much difficulty . I'm sure that'd be fine .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Alright .
C :  Yeah .
A :  If it's do-able we can do . Yeah , sounds good to me .
C :  So that's everything , then ?
B :  Okay .
A :  Alright , thank you .
D :  Okay is that my turn then ?
A :  That means you're up . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Alright .
D :  I have a shorter report for you today . Um , it took a while to get this , uh
D :  Uh .
B :  You're not plugged in yet .
D :  Oh . That's a very good point .
D :  Okay , so um , this report is about uh trend-watching . Um , basically so we can live up to our , our uh purpose of having a very fashionable remote control . Sorry . There we go .
D :  Um So , just so you know , my method was mainly web web-based research this time around . I also spoke with fashion experts in Milan , New York and Paris . And I looked at the design reports from previous years , here at Real Remote . Um , just so c we can work off of them , see how fashions have changed .
D :  Um , so I'll list the three most important aspects that I've come across . Um , and they , they're each more important than the one that comes after it . Uh , the first one is that there should be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look-and-feel . Um , this should be our priority , as we've been saying .
D :  The second most important aspect is that a remote sh that the remote control should be technologically innovative . So , I think we've done a lot of talking about that , just with lighting and the buttons and the
D :  face-plates . Um , so it looks like we'll be able to keep on track with that . And the third most important aspect is that the remote control should be easy to use .
D :  So , pretty basic there .
D :  And the recent fashion update , uh , according to fashion-watchers in Paris and Milan , is that fruit and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes and furniture .
D :  Um , also , in contra uh in contrast to last year , the feel of the material is expected to be spongy . Again , we've already discussed that with rubber versus hard plastic buttons .
D :  Um
D :  So , my personal preferences here ,
D :  um of course , as we , we've already talked about the personal face-plates in this meeting , and I'd like to stick to that . The fruits and vegetable themes , I don't know if that's going to work for us . It sounds something that you'd use on kitchenware . I don't know if we wanna do it on remotes . It could be one of the options . Maybe for the television that people have in their kitchen .
B :  Mm .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um , the temporary light-up idea , sounds like we're gonna stick to that . And then , uh , tying in a trendy look with user-friendliness .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , it's the fruits and vegetables is the only
A :  area that I find rather jarring . Everything else we can really , we can really
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  It is strange .
A :  um , do , according to our plans already , given the market . But fruits and vegetables seems a very strange idea for a remote control .
D :  It's , it's a little but it , it's everywhere . So maybe we I've seen a lot of purses with olives on them , you know . But I I think , I think if we stick to T_V_ based , you know , maybe T_V_ shows , or
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But they still need to um fit into people's decor though .
D :  Or colour schemes .
B :  We
D :  Right .
B :  I think we possibly could take a more abstract design . Like look at the basic shapes of different fruits and vegetables . And then just really like strip it down to like really basic shapes . I mean we don't have to make something in the shape of a strawberry , but it could have the curves of a strawberry , or something . Or a strawberry seed or a leaf . Or just like you know really make it a quite abstract , if that's fits in more with what we're doing . Instead of fruits and vegetables , just if you look at it straightforward , it's a bit yeah . It doesn't s quite fit in with the trendy well , obviously it does , if that's the current theme . But may maybe we could go more directly , I don't know . But initially , I dunno . I think if we just sort of tone it down a bit .
D :  Yeah . The
C :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  The essence of strawberry . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Tone it down . Yeah , like more like photos of fruit , on , on our product .
B :  Yeah and like not , not yeah .
D :  I guess , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Or banana-shaped .
D :  One thing I was thinking though is I dunno if you all remember from our kickoff meeting , we talked about our favourite animals . So maybe there could be animal-based , you know . Because a lot of people have a house cat . Or , or a dog .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Um , that might be getting , you know , too specific , and we should see what the success of the first face-plates are . But it's something to keep in mind .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And , did you have any questions ?
D :  Pretty straightforward ?
A :  Yeah um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Alright , given that information ,
A :  we need to start making some more specific decisions .
A :  So I'll need to um hook up the PowerPoint again .
D :  There you go .
D :  Have you guys been saving your PowerPoint presentations to the okay .
B :  I didn't for the first one . But I have now . Yeah . Uh , hopefully . Project documents I think .
A :  But it's still around right ? Okay .
C :  Where do you have to save it to ?
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  I'm just trying to make this pop up now .
A :  Alright . Here we go .
A :  Okay so we have to uh decide now exactly what we are going to do . So energy , we oh .
B :  Okay .
A :  Oh no I can't write it in when it's in this setting .
B :  'Kay .
A :  Does anyone know how to take it out of
A :  Um , yeah .
C :  Just escape I think .
D :  The PowerPoint ?
A :  Yeah . Okay . Um , so back to decisions . Energy , we've decided on kinetic , right ? Okay , so that's good .
B :  Kinetic yeah . Are we going to have a backup ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Or do we just
A :  But would a backup really be necessary ?
A :  I mean will people just use the battery if there's no , if there's ,
B :  I think maybe we could just go for the kinetic energy , and
A :  if there is backup .
B :  be bold and innovative , and hope this works , and well hope that it works . I think yeah . I think no . I , I think we should just like take uh advantage of like using this to its full potential . Go for it .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . There's like no reason why it wouldn't work , right ?
D :  So
A :  Yeah . It could even be one of our selling points .
C :  Yeah .
B :  It could be fully kinetic energy . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Environmentally conscious or something .
D :  So if it's not working they just have to shake it a bit and that revitalises it ? Okay .
B :  Is everyone happy with that ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hope so .
A :  Alright , the next um decision is chip on print . I don't exactly know what that means .
B :  Um , it was whether we went for the simple , the regular , or the advanced chip . And that linked in with what buttons we would gonna have , so
A :  Right , and we were going for more simplistic style , right ?
B :  Yeah , it was so that was without the L_C_D_ . So that means we're not doing the advanced . So it depends on whether we wanted the scroll buttons or just the push buttons .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I think we decided on the pushbuttons , right ?
C :  Yeah . I don yeah .
B :  Uh , so that's the simple .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah . Would we need a more advanced one for uh the lighting , the interior lighting system ?
B :  Yeah possibly . So , it's probably gonna be the regular chip that we're going to need . So it's a medium . So regular chip . Regular sorry .
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Okay . That's called medium , or regular ?
A :  'Kay .
B :  Regular chip .
D :  Oh , is regular not simple ?
C :  Yeah . It's for the lighting , yeah .
B :  Lighting . Yeah if we because of the lighting that we've decided to put in as well .
D :  Right right right .
A :  Okay , and cases . Um , does this , is this dependent on shape , or what it's made of , or what ?
B :  So th
B :  I think this is just like gonna be the a very outer case , which we will decide on rubber .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Well , I guess plastic and coated in rubber . Plastic with rubber
B :  Rubber . Yeah . Plastic rubber coat .
C :  Yeah plastic coat .
A :  coating and interchangeable
B :  Interchangeable , yeah . Still going for that . Yeah .
A :  yeah , interchangeable plates . Okay .
A :  User interface concept .
A :  This is your time to shine .
C :  We decided on the component . I , I I'm sorry , I've lost my um
C :  PowerPoint thing , so I can't remember what it's ca it's the component
B :  Your screen ?
D :  Think it was called command interface .
B :  Was it
A :  Oh , yeah . Yeah .
D :  Command interface , .
C :  The command inter
A :  Command interface .
B :  Ouch .
C :  The command line interface yeah .
A :  Did you say command line ? Okay .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Line interface .
A :  Alright , and supplements .
A :  What's that all about ?
C :  Um ,
C :  I think that is well we haven't really made any decisions about
C :  what we're gonna do about the cluster of button functions , colours and forms , in the in consistent use . Like what what are ideas to combat these problems ? You know how um different interfaces are very different , and can be confusing because because of their difference , and because of the different clusters of buttons that they have .
A :  Um
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  We haven't really decided what to do about that .
A :  Um , what are our choices here ?
C :  Well it's just um
C :  w where where shall we locate the buttons . What kind of functions wi shall we have ?
A :  You mean like we'll have the numbers of the channels , and we'll have the channel-changer , and volume , and power ?
B :  The power .
B :  Volume .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Um
C :  So pretty just just the basic button functions .
A :  Yeah . Like I don't know if we should go into like adjusting light levels , things like that , because different televisions will have
B :  May yeah . Tone , contrast , and things . That's a bit
A :  Um , yeah .
D :  That was on , um
D :  one of my presentations . About how often it was used . Do you remember that ?
B :  Yeah , it was minima well , it wasn't the l
A :  Yep .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it was hardly ever used really .
D :  I w
D :  Should I bring it up ?
A :  Yeah . And most televisions will come with a remote .
B :  Yeah . That would be good . Yeah , and surely that would be like quite specific to the individual television , so
C :  Yeah , each television .
A :  Yeah .
A :  'Kay , well we know we want numbers .
D :  The ch t
D :  Screen settings was used um zero point five times an hour . So tw twice every once every two hours .
D :  Um , and it was considered a one point five relevance , on a scale of ten . That's brightness , colour , tone , all that .
B :  Mm . I think most of that comes like on the i individual television set itself , doesn't it ? I'm sure it has its own buttons , so you don't necessarily need to have it on remote .
C :  You don't change that often , yeah .
A :  Yeah , it does .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah , and different televisions . Like we , I don't know if we can make a remote that would be universal to all the different kinds of
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . So we're just going for power , channels , volume ,
A :  changes like that .
A :  Volume .
D :  The other one was audio settings . Mono , stereo , pitch . I mean I sometimes use that . Some T_V_s will have the option of like living room style , movie style , um and that , they say that's used zero point eight times an hour , which is actually somewhat high . Like almost once an hour . Um , relevance of two .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Oh . We have five minutes to finish our meeting .
A :  Crap . Okay , um , let's do this fast . Um
D :  Well that didn't some up on mine .
A :  Should we have audio ?
A :  It only comes up on mine usually .
C :  It w it would seem silly if we'd having anything else , just have an audio button though .
D :  Oh .
C :  Do you know ?
A :  Yeah , I don't , I it's , it's a problem with the international uh appeal , I think . Um , if we have audio because we don't know how other televisions work . But we know that everyone has this and it's the same .
C :  But we
D :  Yeah I guess that it affects the marketing , 'cause it , mm it is a good sales ploy to say , aren't you annoyed with remote controls that have all these buttons . This one has channel , volume and your channe and your power .
B :  I've
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's it . We can just go for , make it a selling point that it is just the basic . Yeah uh I brilliant .
C :  That could be a sales pitch .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Simple and
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Alright .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Good . And , okay , in closing , 'cause we only have five minutes . We'll be meeting again in thirty minutes . Um ,
A :  you'll be working , Poppy will be working on the look-and-feel design .
A :  Wait a minute . Is that right ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yep , and um the user interface design , so this is where the trendy stuff comes in . And you'll be evaluating the product .
A :  Um ,
A :  Poppy and Tara will have to work together , using modelling clay .
A :  And , um , your personal coach will give you the rest of the information of what needs to happen .
B :  Okay . Um , I just have one question about the whole fruit and vegetable aspect . Are we seeing as that was the most popular thing that came up out of your market research , I thi I think we should keep to that rather than moving to animals or something , because even if that may not seem obvious to us , if that's what the surveys brought out , I think that we should probably go along with that . Um , so I suppose that'll come out in our dev design development . But you're happy to go ahead with the fruit and veg ?
A :  Alright . So , anyone else have something to say ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Now do you guys need want an idea of how many uh are you gonna come up with casing ideas ? Like f five different
B :  Y Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  five . .
C :  What I
C :  What I was thinking what do yous think of this ? Um , having the numbers kind of like , not a bunch of grapes , but you know like purple and kind of in a triangle .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Like grapes . Like that's kind of fruity or something . That's just
D :  Yeah you can have some fun with the buttons , it's true .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  We can have a look at those ideas , yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  I guess what you i ideally you'd kind of think of age markets as well . So it's a something that will , you know , appeal to the fifteen to twenty five year olds . Something that your granny would want on her remote control . Um , and international tastes as well , so
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Not easy .
B :  Tricky . A lot of things to consider . Hm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Lots of yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Alright .
B :  Okay .
A :  'Kay we'll stick to the fruit and veggie theme then . Alright . And , um , we'll reconvene in thirty minutes . 'Kay . Bye . I'll see you later . Oh , what did I just do . Okay .
B :  Okay . Thank you .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  .
A :  Right .
A :  Okay .
A :  Alright . Is everyone here ? Okay . This is our conceptual design meeting .
D :  Yep .
C :  Yep .
A :  And
A :  I'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . Um then each of you will have your presentation , um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control .
A :  And then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . Um
A :  I'll go through the mee through the minutes first . Um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . Um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . Um and
A :  our Marketing Expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . Um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . People thought their remotes were ugly , um
A :  that remotes zap a lot . Um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons .
A :  Um and that they often lose the it's easy to lose a remote . Um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . Um
A :  And uh some sort of locator . Either a button or tracking device . Um
A :  And that it should look different than what's out there .
A :  Um
A :  Kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . The younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . Um uh I think we decided that
A :  um the expense was not necessarily worth it , and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . Um
A :  Then the User Interface Designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . Um the simple versus the um the complex . The simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . Um
A :  Um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . Um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . Um we would just have a T_V_ remote . Um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . Have it s be something that looks different .
A :  And finally our um Industrial Designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . Um from energy source , um uh what we would use . Batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . Um
A :  How that would power the remote and the lamp . If we were to to have one . Uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the T_V_ . Um
A :  I believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . Um
A :  Um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand .
A :  And with a , just a few buttons . Just the basics . And with a scrolling um function also .
A :  Okay and I will leave that , leave it at that . So
A :  Marketing ? We're watching trends . I suppose that you can have this .
D :  Okay .
D :  Yep . Can I have your cable please ? Thanks .
D :  Okay so I was looking at trend-watching .
D :  Um unfortunately I wasn't given too much information . I was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . And then I'll just tell you some personal preferences that I got from that .
D :  Um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , which I think we've kind of already discussed before .
D :  Um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . And again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . And thirdly the remote would be easy to use .
D :  As far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . So that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , but we can try .
D :  Um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel .
D :  Okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . Um I think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . But I think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and
D :  Whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . Um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . We brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further .
D :  And Manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . We need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , which I think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for .
D :  Um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . I don't know , I mean I guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . Yeah . Yeah . Right . Or with exterior designs . But my question is , I mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , and I'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . So maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , or I don't know , different options for female , male target groups .
A :  A banana shape ?
C :  Oh it was sort of banana shaped .
D :  And then the spongy feel . I guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . C and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls .
D :  So that's that .
A :  So possibly like a uh , sorry , just to butt in for a second . Possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ?
B :  Alright .
D :  That's what I was thinking yeah .
C :  Those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones .
A :  You have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy
D :  Yeah . So when you buy your remote you can buy
A :  feel to it . You can
D :  various coverings .
C :  What's it called ? Cust you personalised , yeah .
A :  Mm various covers .
D :  Personalise your remote .
A :  We could leave that to the cover department .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  We all know they've got nothing to do all day .
C :  Okay .
C :  Why can't I see the crazy . Um yeah I talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . Um so I've looked at some of the stuff I was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . But keep in mind that our own ideas that we had .
C :  Um I was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices .
C :  They gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . Um okay . There's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . Um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and
C :  well on a screen . A command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . Um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . You can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated .
C :  So , then I had a look at new products that are on the market . Not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . Um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . I have a there is a picture . You surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . Store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , T_V_ , cable , satellite , V_C_R_ , D_V_D_ and audio .
C :  And you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . So the technology is there . Um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . You can sort of just make those out .
C :  And then on the right is obviously an iPod , which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , and really is , and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . That is a
C :  possibility . And nothing's simpler really . Um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . So the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch .
C :  And um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . So I don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes .
C :  Um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . Sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a V_ for volume . Just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design .
C :  Um I think , d carrying on from what I've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . Maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit .
C :  And then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . Um I don't it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an iPod where you just sort of control through the menus . Stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . And then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . And that is it . Why am I
C :  Oh yeah .
C :  Just .
C :  Where are we ? Uh .
C :  Just to sort of show you .
C :  M they've even got things like that . Huge things . Which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ?
B :  That's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Notice the giant dog bone shape ? Also good for animals .
D :  Dunno .
C :  And that yeah .
B :  Makes sense , makes sense .
C :  Yeah . See .
C :  things .
C :  .
C :  Why's my screen crazy ?
B :  Uh
B :  Well let's see . I'm going to bore you with a
B :  couple of descriptions of the interior .
B :  Just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . I've more information on possible materials um as well . What we can and cannot do .
B :  Um but let's just wait for this to load up and I'll show you
B :  what we're talking about here . Okay .
B :  The details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . The underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp which
B :  then um of course shines infrared light onto the television which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . Um
B :  So much for the the workings of the
B :  of the uh
B :  remote control itself . Its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television .
B :  When you press a key um you complete a specific connection . The chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . It produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . Right . Pretty clear .
B :  Transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the L_E_D_ which translates the signal into infrared light . The sensor in the T_V_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately .
B :  This is the circuit board from the other side . Um the lower part of it , I don't know if you can see that properly , with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over .
B :  Um you can see the circuit board itself . That's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . Um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board .
B :  These are the actual keys that are being pressed . They close the electric circuit . That then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . That would be behind here . Um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that
B :  amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there .
B :  Now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . Um the way it works is that you have the keys here . The rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . And thus gives on the signal . Now this is the simple version .
B :  Um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . We are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well .
B :  And not only that . Um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . Um I've gotten some information that
B :  we could use for the case material plastic ,
B :  rubber , as well . Um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . So it's pretty squishy . That would that would serve that purpose . Um we could also use wood , or titanium .
D :  Spongy ?
A :  What's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ?
B :  Oh fya I don't have an information on that . However our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so I assume , I'm , I was given an okay to use it . It certainly is an expensive material , I'm aware of that , but I was given an okay .
B :  But there are certain restrictions to certain materials . Now let's first go through the list with the materials . So we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . Can also mix these .
B :  Um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . Um what we could use is , or what I was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . Right ?
B :  Uh a dynamo .
B :  Interestingly enough .
B :  Um we could use solar cells .
B :  Or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . Such as like watches you know . Where you just move them
B :  m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . So um obviously
B :  I personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . You don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it right ? Um solar cell is interesting . May fail though , every here and there .
C :  Mm .
C :  Would you have to leave it by the window ? yeah .
B :  Mm . Yeah . Or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week and yeah mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Always the you
A :  Works well in Arizona but in Edinburgh not so
B :  But exactly . Um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . You leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . So I'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery .
D :  Y probably not yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Which also makes a base station basically obsolete . We don't need that then .
B :  Um
B :  our interface options are push-buttons . In which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert .
B :  Um
B :  However we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . And they are possible . We have an okay for scroll wheels . Okay . Um however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the iPod
B :  I've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an L_C_D_ into the remote control as well . This however may exclude certain um materials . If you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an L_C_D_ screen may be affected by the movement . Hence we might not be able to put it in there . So um
B :  There's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . If we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that I've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . I don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference .
B :  I'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , but that's not up to me to decide really . So that's for the for the scroll wheel . Um it limits our choice and squishy is hip , so I'd say
B :  rather not go for for that . Let's see now . Um um solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . But obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , I assume right ? Or is anybody still alright .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  No I think I think batteries are probably the way to go .
D :  No . Hmm .
B :  Alright . Uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional I assume . Um
C :  Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  With the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . We would just be able to make it flat and
B :  and um yeah a straight design pretty much . Which I assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions .
C :  Would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . So I don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic . But then where do people hold it ? Just all be sort of spongy .
D :  Mm . Like a covering . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  The we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it .
C :  So you as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? Like the iPod ?
B :  You can have an L_C_D_ screen . Um but therefore no rubber will be used . Alright ? So plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . With plastic , as I understand it , you can use any form . Um latex
C :  Right .
B :  is tricky . Or rubber and um
B :  and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . So the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an L_C_D_ screen , and um
B :  then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . Or wood even . Um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Add an L_C_D_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine . Or make it just push-buttons . Basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . Maybe not the nicest feel . Or not much originality really .
A :  So the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? Or the rubbery we cannot ?
B :  With rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an L_C_D_ screen .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Mm .
D :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
B :  That's the tricky thing .
C :  Could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana-esque . So that's thing if we did it yellow . And um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . They wouldn't have any they're just on the exterior . They wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ?
B :  S Certainly can be done yes . Um yeah . if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . Like say just the underside or so then it can be done . I assume . Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So
B :  The fruit design um
B :  How about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ?
B :  Say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , but uh give it like the surface of
D :  Mm .
B :  an orange , banana , whatever . You name it .
C :  Mm .
A :  What about a smell ? T to the remote ?
B :  Just design-wise .
B :  Mm . Nice one .
C :  You could just sell it in different colours as well I suppose . In different ye yellows . I don't suppose we have to stick to co
D :  Bright citrus colours yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , that's yellow and grey . So what have we , lemon , banana , is
C :  Stick to the colours yeah .
D :  Oh yeah . Yellow and grey .
A :  Yellow and grey .
C :  Mm grapefruit .
A :  Grapefruit .
B :  Grapefruit is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps .
B :  But mm .
A :  I would say , if I were to make a decision , I would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance .
C :  Yeah .
C :  .
A :  Um
D :  I think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , like
C :  Yeah .
B :  Well we have it banana-shaped already , kind of . So
D :  Well we kinda do yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And if it's yellow ?
C :  and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour .
B :  Right .
A :  It's it's yellow . It's curved .
B :  I it's yellow .
D :  Grey buttons yeah .
B :  Well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ?
A :  It's sort of couple of couple of grey stripes . We could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . It would look like a banana just sitting on their table .
C :  Yeah .
C :  On the the gr the rubbery grips could be grey .
D :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
B :  There you go .
A :  Rather than rather th
C :  It could and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , and then people would always know where it was .
D :  Oh .
A :  Maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . Could be , it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . Hey we could have a variety of options here .
D :  Nice . Could look like a fruit bowl .
B :  It could be an ape .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  'Kay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Do you have more to your presentation ?
B :  That's pretty much it . I informed you about the materials , what the interior has to look like , and what the limitations to certain materials are on there you go .
A :  Oh .
A :  Okay . I'm gonna plug in here real quick . If I could .
B :  Sure . Hang on . There you go .
A :  Like I said we have to make a decision on
A :  a couple of these items here . Um ow . Ow .
D :  So is the two piece idea out ? Or have we not decided ?
C :  Well we sort of
C :  rid of that because gonna use a battery . And the base station might not be necessary .
D :  Oh right okay .
B :  Well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . We can still do that .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Mm .
B :  However of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . So um which then , as I understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . Say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an L_C_D_ screen and so on so on . You'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
B :  design which we saw there .
D :  Mm .
B :  But could be done , of course .
A :  Okay . Uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . Um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case .
A :  Probably case um material . And probably a shape also .
A :  Um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . And what kind of supplements we'll have .
A :  Um
A :  Energy source I think we've , I think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet .
B :  Right .
A :  And we have five minutes .
B :  Okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as I said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . Uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be
D :  Mm .
B :  a cheap one . Right ?
A :  'Kay .
A :  So
A :  Um I guess we should pick the case then . If we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um
A :  then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . We could have a complex one or a a non-complex . But did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well what about what you said , like putting the
C :  Just just maybe yeah . Just a little bit of .
A :  .
D :  finger grips just on top of the plastic ?
A :  Okay . So we would , we would have the L_C_D_ screen ?
B :  as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes .
A :  'Kay .
A :  So I guess the case would be plastic , with
A :  Perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . It's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe .
C :  Yeah .
B :  .
D :  Yeah .
B :  M more of a l lamination perhaps .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So then for the scroll , are we going for the iPod type ?
C :  Yeah I think so . I think
D :  Yeah ? Okay .
A :  Which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ?
B :  Yes . It does .
A :  'Kay . So
A :  I guess that , is that , is that about it ? So we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ?
B :  Right .
A :  Um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . Um
A :  Here's what's gonna be going on . Um
A :  Um Ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . Um
A :  Manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design .
B :  Right .
A :  Corrine we'll want a product evaluation .
A :  And the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh
A :  maybe and and get us a prototype .
A :  Which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . So that basically just be working on the prototype , uh we'll accomplish your other two actions .
A :  Alright . Okay . Let's do it .
A :  Okay . Uh good afternoon . This is our third meeting already . I hope you enjoyed your lunch . I did anyway . Um let's see .
D :  Good afternoon .
A :  Presentation three . Okay this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . It's the conceptual design meeting . And a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components .
A :  Uh conceptual specification of design . And also trend-watching . Um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations you're going to show me in a few minutes .
A :  Um but first I'll show you the agenda . Uh first the opening . Then we have three presentations . Uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . How we're going to make it . And then we're closing . We have about forty minutes .
A :  Uh so I suggest let's get started . Uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ?
B :  No .
A :  No ? Everything fine ? That's nice .
A :  Then a little uh thing about the last meeting . Uh these are the points um we agreed on . The requirements and the target market . Uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . And we are going to use default materials .
A :  Um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? Maybe ? No ? These are just the the things we thought of , so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . And maybe we can uh work it out .
A :  And we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers .
A :  So now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , um I suggest let's get started with the presentations .
A :  So shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ?
D :  Sure . I'll start off then .
A :  Okay .
A :  Good luck .
D :  Doh .
D :  'Kay I'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching I've done over the past few days . Um we've done some market research . We distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires .
D :  And um besides that um I deployed some trend-watchers to Milan and Paris to well get all of the newest trends . And I've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the
D :  the best design would be . Um okay these are some overall findings . Um most important thing is the fancy design . Um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor .
D :  Um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . By innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls .
D :  Um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . Um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal .
D :  'Kay these are some more group specific findings . Uh the older people prefer dark colours . Uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . And our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much
D :  the material for older people . Um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have .
D :  Um this leads us to some personal preferences . Uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the
D :  in the room . Um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . Just keep it simple and Well the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , because this would be the These would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control .
D :  So this would be very important that we at least include these features . Um well the trend-watchers I consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . So you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station .
D :  This is not really This is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . So they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . So it would be kinda more telephone-shaped .
D :  Um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . The wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . People with more money . Uh the grey-black colour for well
D :  people with less means .
D :  That would be all .
A :  Okay . Thank you . Any questions about the the trends ? Mayb
D :  Any questions ?
B :  Mm no .
A :  No ? Okay , we go on to the next one .
B :  Um 'kay um yeah . uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . Um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . So uh um uh that's w what I what I want to uh
B :  uh to do in uh our design . So um finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . Um the uh I found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . So maybe uh we can uh use uh that . Um
B :  Uh and uh using a little uh display . So um findings . Um yeah just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions .
B :  So uh only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . Um uh let's see . Um yeah and
B :  Uh we uh need some uh new a attractive functions uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . So uh it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . Just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting .
B :  Um and yeah overall um user-friendly . So uh using uh large large buttons . Um
B :  It's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . Um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . So uh uh yeah .
B :  And and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off or
B :  A and uh yeah . Television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . Um
B :  Let's see . Uh yeah . I was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , um just one button to keep it uh simple . Uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles .
B :  Um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh
B :  um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . So uh Um
B :  Yeah and w we have to keep uh in general buttons uh so um we've got um the buttons we have to use . The on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine .
B :  Um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . Um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons .
B :  And um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . So um made a little uh picture of uh it . Um
B :  See .
B :  Um yeah . Just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . Um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . So um
B :  D display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . Uh um you can put it uh on top . Um it's uh most uh
B :  uh place where people uh , most of looks at . So uh um and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the
B :  So you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . Um it's uh quite uh
B :  handy place . So um and uh all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh
B :  Uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh I think uh so uh the form of it so
A :  Okay .
B :  And that's it .
A :  Uh thank you .
C :  Okay .
C :  About the components design . Um for the energy source we can use a basic battery or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , which you just shake and it produces energy . But if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . So I don't think it's really an option .
C :  Uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . It's really up the the design that we're gonna use . It's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions .
C :  Uh as a case supplement , we could um , I thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip .
C :  Uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . And the chip-set , um it says simple here , but it should be advanced , because we're using an L_C_D_ uh screen .
C :  And as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , but it raises the price and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . Form should follow function overall .
C :  Um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . But depends on what we want . I think we should disc discuss that . Um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . And the chip-set uh really should be advanced because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . And that's it .
A :  Okay . Thank you .
A :  So that brings us to the discussion about our concepts .
A :  Mm .
A :  'Kay .
A :  So these are the points we have to discuss .
A :  Um first
A :  I think we can talk about the energy source , since that's um
A :  has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . Uh so
A :  uh f I think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , I think .
C :  Yes w there there are four options . We could use the basic normal battery . Uh a hand dynamo . But I don't think that's really an option . You don't wanna swing before you can watch television . Uh solar cells . But not every room is very light so it's not a very good option . Or the kinetic energy .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  No .
A :  Yeah . Okay .
D :  And how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? You just
C :  Well y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . Yeah .
D :  You use it and it works .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay . Well personally I don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it .
B :  Nah .
C :  Yeah . That's true .
D :  And besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . And I think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um
C :  Oh .
D :  get great popularity for our product .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Um wel
B :  what's the function ? Yeah f for loading up uh the batteries .
D :  Yeah you could load up the batteries , you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there .
B :  B b
B :  Okay but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh I I believe . Uh it's uh just a small display so I believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . So I believe one battery uh is just enough . Uh so
A :  Uh
A :  Uh well I think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . And I don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . So maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place .
D :  That's true .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . That's true . Yeah .
A :  And also what you said . Um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . But I think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . So you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  And then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh .
A :  That's safe .
D :  I'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ?
A :  Yeah . That's a good point .
C :  Mm I don't have any information on pricing . So I'll have to ask the manufacturing department .
B :  Mm .
D :  'Cause in our earlier um market research , if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , SMARTboard .
A :  Yeah , sure . Go ahead .
D :  Um so it was open here .
D :  Um we also um
D :  asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . Well you can see here , our target group would not do that . So if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control
A :  No .
B :  Mm .
D :  I would greatly advise not to do it . I think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  younger people .
C :  But that would also go for the L_C_D_ screen then I guess .
B :  'Kay .
C :  It's a bit higher percentage , but
D :  Um well this is Yeah but this is here the question was , would you prefer it . So that doesn't really mean they wouldn't pay extra for it . And on top of that the L_C_D_ screen would um help in making the remote control easier to use .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  And I think a voice recognition function would not make the remote control much easier to use .
C :  Okay .
A :  Easier to use ? No , I think that's a good point .
B :  But uh is uh our uh research um about um bi large uh L_C_D_ sh uh display , or uh just a small one uh we want to uh use ?
D :  Um well this was for like an L_C_D_ screen like you would have on a on the the most advanced mobile phones .
B :  Okay .
D :  So pretty large .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I personally think the L_C_D_ screen we wanna use , with the extra information , I think nobody has anything against it . Because it's just uh some extra information , and it's easy to ignore as well . So if you don't wanna use it you just don't use it .
B :  No .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And um yeah I think the um Maybe we have to uh discard the voice recognition . Because it will increase cost uh signifi uh significantly . And I don't think the I don't think it will be a lot easier to use , as well .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So that brings us back to the energy . If we don't have the voice recognition , it will it won't use a lot of energy to use . Um
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  So in that case we could use kinetic uh energy , but I think just a simple battery which you can reload on a docking station is just as good . And much cheaper as well .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And that's the best choice .
A :  So
A :  Okay let me just choose for the battery . That brings us to the chip .
C :  Well there isn't any choice there because we're using the the the the display . So it's gotta be advanced .
A :  Just the advanced .
A :  Okay , advanced chip .
D :  'Kay .
A :  And then we get to the point of the case . Um which brings us a little bit back to marketing as well . Uh if we wanna choose for wood or the black and grey . Or both ?
A :  Um as we saw there is not Yeah wood is a lot more expensive to produce . Um but I think it will attract elderly people who wanna have something exclusive , which they can show off to their grandkids . Look I've got a new remote control , and uh
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Well And I think most important factor there is the wooden colour . So it wouldn't actually have to be wood , if it's just
B :  Uh I dunno .
A :  Yeah .
A :  That's right .
D :  wood-coloured .
B :  Mm .
A :  But with colour was a lot more expensive ? Or ?
C :  Mm I dunno . I'll have to uh research .
A :  You don't know ?
A :  I think so because Yeah . It's a lot more difficult to to handle and to to get in the right shape .
D :  Probably .
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . So um uh you 'cause uh Yeah with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the Nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . So
A :  Yeah .
A :  Change the cases . Yeah .
B :  maybe it's possible uh possibility . So um um you have just to make one um standard um remote control , and um yeah you can sell uh few uh Yeah .
A :  You can sell the cases . Yeah . I think that's a very good option . Because um then you can advertise as well with the Give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Because that's a it's something extra , it's something other remotes don't have , which we can get a great advantage point . So and then you can make them with colour . Black and grey , other colours as well .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah that is true .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . We would have to look carefully into the design though .
A :  Costs .
D :  'Cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a
D :  plastic cover . The more original one , or the more standard one .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So that would
A :  Yeah . So you suggest we should design two different telephones
A :  on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example .
D :  Well I wouldn't design a telephone but
D :  Well no I think w we should just , we should then just design one um
A :  Remote .
D :  one remote , but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  So , but that shouldn't be too much of a problem .
A :  So everybody's okay with the changing covers ?
C :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I think that's a good uh good option .
A :  Changing case covers .
D :  Um I heard our Industrial Designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . Could you explain that a little more ?
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . And uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases .
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  And what would single curved and double curved mean ?
C :  Um it would just only affect the form , for as far as I know . So it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . It doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality .
D :  Okay .
D :  So we can pretty much just do whatever we want .
C :  Pick one you like , yes .
A :  Mm . Okay .
D :  'Kay .
D :  That's good .
A :  Uh but the form has to be um It has to
A :  It's has to be possible to stand up ? Or just only to lie down ?
D :  No just to lie down .
B :  okay .
A :  And the the cover of the the docking station is also
D :  We'll go for that .
A :  on top of the television then ? Or not ?
D :  Well or besides it .
A :  And you can just yeah then click it in . That's okay . Um so the interface . What type of interface do we want to use ?
A :  Um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  on the the board . Does somebody have ideas for a form or
B :  Mm .
B :  Uh we can just use the regular form of it , but it's um not quite uh fancy . So um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , so you could , so your thumb would be easily Well uh I think that was a very good point 'cause I pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause R_S_I_ . So that would be great for that . Um I thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  For uh Uh for Yeah yeah .
D :  For left-handed users also .
A :  Yep .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah we um
B :  Is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? And on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? Or Or isn't it ?
D :  For the volume . Um well that could
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah we could do that but I'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use .
A :  Usabili Yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , and then it's
B :  Yeah okay .
B :  Uh .
D :  But if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote .
B :  Mm .
D :  'Cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff .
B :  Yeah but
A :  But you have extra buttons . So people can get confused .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  That is true .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Especially if they have the same writings on it .
B :  See um yeah . Or we have to make a left uh For lefties and
A :  Can't we make uh Can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use
A :  on the same
B :  Um
A :  functions as the normal one ?
B :  You mean um
A :  Then you have to
B :  Yeah if
A :  Let's see if I ca
A :  A blank one .
A :  And then you get
A :  Here's a little L_C_D_ screen .
A :  Uh now I have to think .
A :  It's a plus and a min .
A :  No it's not very handy I think . Because the plus and the min will be opposite and all kinds of
B :  Mm no .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  No that's not gonna work .
A :  I guess . Maybe we should Yeah . But is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? I think the functions are
B :  Um
A :  that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel or
D :  Yeah . That is true .
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's just uh u using uh your thumb . So um it's
A :  Y yeah . Yeah . I think we could just uh leave it a normal shape .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Uh but maybe we have to
A :  make it a l a bit more fancy . In one or ano another way .
B :  Yeah . Um
C :  I think we should start by by choosing a case . Because that's the basis you're building on .
B :  Yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um yeah just
C :  So I could draw them out .
C :  Let's look at the flat case .
C :  Oh .
C :  It's from the side so it's rather normal . The the single curved so I'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but I think it's something like this .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
C :  So this type should be better for you or better Should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit .
A :  Easier ?
C :  And the double curved s looks something like this I guess .
C :  So th those are the three options we have .
B :  Mm .
A :  'Kay . I suggest um the single curved , because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . Uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control and at the same time look easily at the screen , because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle .
D :  Mm .
B :  So um
B :  Do you say this um
B :  S uh
B :  Uh you got like uh sort of a I believe There ?
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  So um you want to put a display over here ? Or not ? Yeah .
A :  Yeah . I think so . Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  Yeah . Uh we can make it um Mm ? That's the top . So uh this top . This down . Um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like um Let's see . Um
A :  But now it's
A :  Do you have it upside down or Do you have it this that's top ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Colour uh okay .
B :  Uh to make this side um like mm
B :  the right colour . Um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . So um
B :  Uh it's an
A :  Yeah .
B :  So so the remote control have to um lay in your hand . So uh it's possib um yeah for s so and
A :  So get your mouse . Yeah .
B :  And to put uh the the buttons for um
B :  changing uh the channel uh over here uh
A :  Yeah . That's a good one . But I think it's better to put the screen uh on top .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Uh rem
A :  So just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around then you get here . If you can have this one , you turn it like this . And then flip it upside down .
B :  Yeah but this place um
B :  Uh it's Yeah I dunno um
A :  Because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  It's more logical to have it on top as well because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above .
A :  I think i
B :  Yeah so
D :  Yeah .
A :  On top .
B :  So
A :  Yeah .
C :  Oh maybe you should just s start on a blank page .
A :  . So then we get
D :  Yeah .
A :  Here's That's the curve .
B :  Five minutes .
A :  Here the display , and then buttons . Yeah and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . Just that's for left hand and right hand users .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  And then h the rest of the buttons over here .
B :  Yeah . But um the on-off button , um still on the top uh Yeah .
A :  Yeah still here jus
B :  Yeah .
A :  That's
D :  And I'd prefer the corners to be round .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . 'Kay .
D :  Think that would be better .
A :  Should be more bit more friendly , yeah .
D :  Friendly on the eye .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Supplements . That's okay .
A :  Where's my mouse ? Then
A :  We've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . So now for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . It's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . So check out the corporate website maybe .
A :  The user interface design , it's the same story . And product evaluation . So the Industrial Designer and User Interface Designer are going to work together on this one . But you're going to get your instructions I think sended by the coach .
A :  So just um I will put these um minutes on the in the folder .
C :  Okay .
A :  And then we're going to uh try to finish our project , and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , I think . Which are Uh let's see . I'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together or I think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . And then you'll get a message .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  So that's uh basically it . Maybe this one ? Then we can save this one in the
A :  folders group .
A :  Uh yes , it's here . SMARTboard , there it it . So if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And then I guess we'll start in thirty minutes again .
A :  Thank you .
D :  Very good .
B :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  It's It won't wake up .
D :  Bonjour .
B :  Yeah . I was a bit early . Like
B :  What ? No , I just came in . Uh normally I was one of them .
D :  Why ?
D :  Okay .
B :  Come on .
D :  Check check check check .
A :  Hello . Oop .
B :  Why won't it wake up ?
B :  Is it on ?
D :  The power light doesn't work . You turned it off .
B :  But how ?
B :  Ah , there it is .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  Uh .
C :  I received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . So I'll discuss them with you . Yeah .
A :  Okay , we're just going to the later .
D :  Okay .
B :  Yeah , I received an email as well .
A :  So we're going to talk about the conceptual model .
D :  Oh .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Which one was mine ?
A :  So that's me . Uh okay . So Uh okay .
A :  Okay , so I just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute . What's it called , I dunno . Whatever .
B :  The minutes .
A :  Okay , so we just talked about uh Oh you want me to show that there or
D :  Uh
B :  No , just tell us .
C :  Mm no .
A :  Okay , we just talked about it looks . Has to look nice . Usability is very important . People don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . Um
A :  It has to be very basic , not too many buttons .
A :  Light switches on if you use a button . Uh text T_V_ still has to be a possibility .
A :  And it has to be easy to learn .
A :  That were the things I uh make minutes of . And the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text T_V_ button . That are the functions . That right ?
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yes .
A :  Okay . So I just want to give you uh Mike again , the first uh
A :  presentation of your
D :  Shall I start ?
A :  Yeah .
D :  No .
D :  Okay well
D :  I received an email
D :  Okay .
D :  I searched the web , uh and uh I searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . It has been done in Italy uh Italy and in
D :  uh another country in Europe , I forget it . Uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . So it's very important for us to create something new . So what Michael just said , it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls .
D :  Fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface .
D :  Uh this uh aspect is the most important one . Uh it came out of the research . It uh is twice important as the following . The second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative .
D :  Uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . And then uh that uh This is a point of discussion , because we just decided that we don't make use of uh L_C_D_ or uh speech recognition .
B :  Hmm .
D :  But um this is the second uh important uh aspect , and I think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative .
A :  But we already have the flashing flashing light on the
D :  Uh maybe maybe something new . We have to discuss about it s uh Okay , uh features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . And that's very hard I think .
B :  Yeah , more .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Well , I'll I'll get back on it .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . But uh that was an overall uh point . We already discussed that . Um I've got one picture . Uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So I took uh that part of the webpage . And it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh Pari uh France and uh Italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends .
D :  This trends I th uh trend I think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . But it's about uh clothes and shoes . But the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy . But spongy , what what does spongy says ? Spongy .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Spongy .
C :  Spongy .
B :  Spongy , like sponge .
D :  Okay .
C :  So rubber , kind of .
B :  Uh soft materials .
C :  Yeah .
A :  But maybe th that's al definitely a good idea , because you've you're you drop y your remote control very often on the ground . So it has to be flexible .
B :  Yeah , but Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , it's something that uh it stand there . But I didn't knew uh knew what it means . So spongy means y Yeah .
C :  It's like a sponge .
B :  Soft , sponge .
D :  So it's also a stress-ball .
A :  That's a good That's a good idea . If it's de like that . That's good , a good idea . Is it a bit like like the the the the remote control ?
C :  Yeah , somewhat like
B :  Yeah , but Yeah . How are you gonna make it ?
A :  R_ soft .
D :  Uh
C :  Yeah , I've some uh material uh information , but I'll give you it later in my presentation .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay ?
D :  What do I think ? Uh because a fancy look is the most important thing uh for remote control uh control , I think about changeable fronts .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Uh maybe a see-through one in a a fruit front . Because it's uh it's hot . And uh some basic uh colour fronts .
D :  Uh so we can make uh five different fronts to start with or something . Uh maybe an extraordinary shape , like a sponge . Uh or uh , yeah , just another shape than a normal uh remote control ha uh has . Just uh something round in it , or uh maybe not uh not uh Yeah , I dun dunno . We have to discuss about that .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh y yeah . Main point uh still uh is the technolo technological innovative . Yeah , how do we do that ? Maybe speech ? We ma must have some kind of gadget .
B :  Yeah , I'll get back on that .
D :  So
C :  Hmm .
A :  It's very uh difficult to to to do it . Because it's only twelve and a half Euros you have to spend on every remote control .
D :  Intro Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's the problem . That's the main problem .
B :  Well , I got f also an email from
D :  So
B :  the the technology department .
D :  Maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations .
B :  They have done uh research about it , and uh even more possibilities now with speech . So they recommended using it . Well
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay . Uh let's first watch Paul's presentation first then .
C :  Hmm .
B :  I'll check what they exact mean .
B :  So uh
C :  Yeah , well actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . But maybe it's cheap and it's easy to implement .
B :  Yeah , th that's the only problem . I d They don't say how much it will cost , so Um but uh if we implement uh speech recognition , I think it would be better to implement L_C_D_ as well .
D :  Oh . It's mass production . So you can say , you can
B :  Since you have to uh configure speech thing .
A :  But that's definitely more expensive than
B :  Yeah , that's that's something I dunno .
D :  Yeah . But how uh we we're gonna make many of those . So we can start a mass production , and then the cost will still will be .
A :  Yeah , but a telephone Okay , yeah . But a telephone also have a L_C_D_ and and it's about t two hundred Euros . So uh
B :  Yeah , so uh we gotta de
B :  We have to decide on that .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  That was this ?
B :  Mm uh
C :  Oh I got an email uh
C :  And it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . And
C :  Um
C :  They say uh a display requires an advanced chip . And this is more expensive than all the other chips . So it's m the most expensive .
B :  L_D_C_ doesn't require
C :  Yeah , it says in the email . The display requires an advanced chip .
B :  Okay . And speech recognition ?
C :  Yeah , probably too . I I haven't got anything about speech recognition , but
B :  Advanced . Yeah .
B :  I'll I'll give you my design .
C :  Well it d That's that's the most expensive chip , we need . If we're doing uh if we're doing a display .
B :  Yeah okay . So we Well we can
B :  I had uh
B :  to make a sort of a design . So I did some searching on the internet . I watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls .
B :  I think we should um This is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . I think we should go more to the iPod and M_P_ three players . Mobile phones . More modern . Y yes .
A :  Yeah , just modern modern but still uh basic .
B :  Um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . 'Cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides . And here you just have one , few buttons . So that's that's the main difference . But looks uh I definitely think we should go like this .
B :  And then changeable fonts , so
C :  Hmm .
B :  It's the most important part , I think . But And the home base is something like that , something simple .
B :  Well and then I just ordered the the buttons a bit . Uh basic buttons . On-off , mute . And th maybe two others , I dunno . Text buttons .
A :  Yeah , maybe the teletext tel
B :  Yeah , text button , maybe there and there . And then the colour buttons , if we want it on . I don't find it very usable , but it's Uh I don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well .
D :  No , I don't uh I don't like it .
A :  No .
B :  So and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the iPod . They can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . And uh f above ten . And I think
C :  Hmm .
C :  But it That's on on the display .
B :  No no . That th there is no display there . But it's on the place of the display . And I think we should uh light this up
B :  much more than that part . So the focus is on these two parts .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  So you don't see all the buttons you else need .
A :  But it sounds very difficult to use . Because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it . So you can't use your thumb for it .
B :  Uh well um
B :  This is how it is now . Um
B :  Here uh Well we have volume .
C :  I think it is on uh on the bottom too .
A :  Yeah , down there .
A :  But it's not not the best best .
B :  Yeah . Well here we have also side scrolls .
B :  I dunno if we can use that . Do we want to use
C :  Yeah , okay . Yeah , I've I've got something of that uh too .
A :  Yeah , for volume . For volume , or a channel . Yeah , why not .
B :  For volume ? Well then we can even simplify it more .
C :  Scroll .
B :  By just putting the volume on the side . And and just channel buttons here .
A :  And the channels as well .
A :  Oh yeah .
C :  Yeah , or uh maybe uh The channel buttons are often used . And you can't use them now with your thumb , because the thing is not , it's not easy to control .
B :  But I think uh
B :  Well . Yeah , well it's
B :  Basically it's it's here .
C :  Yeah okay , m maybe we cho should put that on top , and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom .
A :  Yeah , that's better .
B :  They're on top ?
A :  Yeah , just th th th other buttons like text T_V_ . Put that on the button bottom .
C :  Because uh you can't hold it . You can't hold it th the control and push the buttons .
B :  You mean uh these to the low ?
A :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
A :  Except from the on-off button .
B :  Oh okay . Well , yeah .
C :  But I I think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three .
C :  So maybe we can put that on the bottom .
B :  Mm
B :  Maybe . I dunno , but yeah we'll
C :  Like zapping is just switching one channel at a time .
B :  Yeah , maybe it's not easy if it's below . It's harder to zap . So I think uh it should be
B :  should be easy to .
B :  I think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top .
C :  Yeah okay . That's that's good , but
B :  And uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh you don't see 'em very good . I think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . So the focus gets on these parts and not on there .
C :  Yeah okay .
B :  But uh the position of course can be different . It's s We have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So we can uh switch these to I dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half .
C :  Hmm .
C :  No , I think th the the top buttons are okay . They sh Those should be on top . But uh we we can switch those two , yeah .
B :  Okay . Yeah , maybe Those two , yeah . And uh , yeah , you have to make sure it's easy to uh Yes , it has to be big enough so you can hold it , right .
D :  Okay .
B :  Well that's that's my findings . So uh my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . M_P_ three player . And uh well um if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we I don't think we should put it on top then . I think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , that's cool .
B :  To use
C :  Yeah .
B :  So if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . Which won't look good on the front side I think .
A :  Okay .
C :  No .
B :  So that's something we have to decide on .
C :  Yeah , we have to keep it simple .
B :  Yeah .
A :  We have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look .
B :  What we're gonna do . Okay .
C :  Okay , the component design .
C :  I looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge .
C :  So uh this was on the web site . If you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . So
C :  flashy kinda colours . Uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . Not Nothing square-like .
A :  Okay , so Hmm , okay .
B :  Yeah well uh iPod is trendy . And it is well curved square .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Square . Like .
C :  Yeah , but mm is uh has round corners I think . So we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing .
B :  Okay . So not
B :  Yeah okay . Not uh the old uh box look .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And um sports and gaming device style characteristics .
C :  I don't know exactly what that means , but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of
D :  Mm .
A :  Yeah , we have to put our Real Reaction logo as well on the on the remote control . So the colours also . So we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow .
C :  looking , I think .
C :  Okay .
B :  Mm Yeah , it's
C :  Yeah .
B :  Black yellow control .
A :  Maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black .
C :  Yeah , mm n
C :  Not that weird , because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public .
B :  Yeah , but uh I don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . But
A :  We make i Maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front .
C :  No , okay . That's a that's a sen
C :  That's just a matter of tastes , but
B :  Yeah , okay .
C :  We have to use uh kind of flashy colours , I think .
B :  Uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? Can we do that ? So
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , it's cool . Yep . And still trans
C :  Like fronts in in red and yellow and blue and
B :  Yes . So
D :  Oh yeah .
A :  Still still transparent .
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah . But with all with logo on it .
A :  Okay .
C :  Well this is a remote control , a very old one .
C :  Um Then the components . The case has just a Here's black . But we are making it uh
A :  Yeah , we make it som Maybe we have to make it from soft material . Uh I'm not sure .
C :  Yeah , I dunno .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Maybe .
C :  But anyways uh it should be transparent . We decided that , huh ? S
B :  Well one of the options . You can Just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it . So you can just replace them I think .
C :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , we could do that .
B :  That was the idea , or just uh release one .
A :  Yeah . Just give five with them , just in a box . Five different
B :  Yeah , uh Or just uh sell different ones .
C :  Yeah , but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent . So you can still th look through it .
A :  Yeah . Cool .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Um the buttons . Normal rubber I think . Like normal ordinary buttons . Soft .
B :  Yeah , I uh I dunno . A more
A :  Yeah . It it could be like a Nokia , like plastic . That's better prob Yeah .
D :  Uh uh
B :  Yeah , just uh
C :  With the hard hard buttons .
B :  I think uh rubber really has an odd look .
D :  Yeah . The the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the uh the style , I think is part of the remote control itself .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  It it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . Uh it's n doesn't Is uh a button uh um How do you say it ? It it didn't it i it don't come out of the on the background . It is in uh the c a remote control uh
C :  Yeah , it's it's all on one level .
C :  Yeah , on one level .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I know what you mean .
C :  So we have to keep it on the one level . Like th the top it's Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , like mobile phones . Like uh the iPod . Uh just
C :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Okay , it's chos So that should be hard plastic . Then the buttons ?
A :  Yeah , that's cool .
C :  I think . Or maybe
B :  I dunno what uh kind of material it is . But
C :  Yeah .
A :  But maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . Just only the basic uh
B :  Oops .
A :  basic remote control from normal plastic , and
C :  Yeah .
A :  the rounds of it from softer s
C :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And um Then the L_E_D_ . The normal infrared L_E_D_ I think s sufficient . And back light L_E_D_s . So But I think we have to make the case transparent , otherwise the back light won't work . So if you put
A :  I dunno .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Cool .
B :  Uh you can just make them around the buttons uh Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Y i if you The numbers could be can be Yeah , that's right .
C :  Okay .
B :  Or it runs the whole
C :  Yeah , but we can still make it transparent . So Or no
A :  They can choose .
B :  Yeah , you can halfs transparent , or just that it's comes out a bit .
C :  Yeah okay . Good . And in green colour , the back lights or
B :  Different , I think , also .
C :  Yeah ?
A :  Blue .
B :  Blue or red . Whatever you want it , I think . Uh depends on the colour of the
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but you can't choo You can't choose it when you buy it . You have to choose
D :  Uh i
B :  Yeah , that's true . But
C :  No , but I think there are multiple colour LEDs . So
A :  Is it Okay .
D :  Yeah , but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? You
C :  I I know I dunno . Is
B :  Yeah , it can . 'Cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well .
A :  Yeah , okay .
C :  Maybe it's it's more impor more expensive . I think it's
A :  Maybe put some different ones in it . Doesn't matter . It's just No , just some LED .
B :  I have the mo mi I have a blinking light on my phone . And I can change the colour of it .
A :  Okay , cool . Just make it some different colours . Blue , red and green , or something .
C :  Yeah , I dunno . Maybe it's too expensive , but it I th I don't think so .
B :  Well , we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . So
D :  Hmm .
C :  Then uh some more technical things .
C :  I don't know what it is , but it should be there I think . Um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things . W So we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators . There's all these kind of things .
A :  Yeah , we have to hurry up a bit , so
C :  Um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls . So I guess we j we just need that . I don't know what they do or
B :  I'm sure we can fit in .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay yeah , you can you can change Yeah . No .
B :  Yeah okay . We just
C :  Nah , but they just said we need it . Uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , a recharger maybe .
B :  Yeah , we have to make sure to uh
C :  Yeah okay . Yeah but
A :  We still want to have a recharger , don't we ? Is that still the
B :  Yes . Yes .
C :  Yeah , but it i We don't wanna have a ar an How do you call it ? Accu .
A :  A recha Oh no . Uh Battery . It's just a battery . Yeah .
B :  Re recharger . Base station .
C :  Y uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries .
B :  Yeah , batteries . Yes , rechargeable batteries , I think's best .
C :  Okay . Not a separate Okay . And uh a chip , that's this one .
A :  No , just rechargeable batteries .
C :  Then uh I received some possibilities . Um for the energy source we can use batteries or a kinetic uh Like with the pulse watch . So it operates on your wrist kinda .
D :  Ah cool .
D :  Okay .
B :  So if you hold it , it gets powered .
A :  But normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch .
C :  If you hold it .
C :  Yeah , I don't think it will work , and Or we can also use solar cells . But you mostly use it indoors , so
A :  It's dark in the room . No . It's just batteries , that's cheaper .
C :  Yeah , and and we can use the home station kind of thing . Um cases , flat , so uncurved . Uh two D_ curved is um like front to the back . And three D_ curved is also in depth .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
C :  So that's possible . Uh but with three D_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . So we can't use the flat buttons .
B :  Mm . So we need uh two D_ .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I think .
A :  Definitely .
C :  Um these kinda materials can be used .
A :  But it doesn't really matter , we just make it plastic .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I think so too .
A :  The scroll wheels , that's cool . That's for the volume .
C :  Yeah , scroll wheels um
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's good . We can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to . But I think just the volume is enough .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Uh For channels it's not handy , because you scroll too fast .
A :  Okay .
C :  And uh the L_C_D_ . So we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an L_C_D_ .
D :  Mm
A :  I don't think that's an opportunity . Just skip it . Because we don't have time for that to to put it in .
C :  Okay , then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . So th so the regular chip . Because we use scroll wheels .
A :  Yeah , okay .
B :  Okay .
C :  And um
C :  Yeah , that was it I guess . Uh are are we using a a rubber case , or We haven't decided yet .
A :  Okay .
A :  Oh just sk Maybe you have to skip that one as well . It's
B :  Uh I don't think a rubber case looks
D :  Uh but we have to do something about the trend . The trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh . And uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two .
C :  L Yeah , i it it should be soft . You said so ?
B :  Yeah , okay . That Uh fruit and veg , or
B :  Yeah , fruit and veg can be just the covers .
D :  Uh yeah i Just Just on front .
B :  So you can the the spongy yeah , I dunno . I can't imagine a soft remote control .
A :  No .
D :  Neith uh I don't like it uh neither .
A :  No .
B :  I just can't imagine it .
C :  So just hard plastic ? Okay .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I think . Titanium . It's mentioned here uh .
C :  Titanium , uh I think it's too expensive .
A :  But maybe the form has to be a bit different . Not the sh the square form . Just a bit
C :  Yeah , you can make it curved or mm round . But just in two D_ , not in depth .
A :  more rounded . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's right .
B :  Okay .
A :  So
A :  We have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . What exactly . Because we have to know it . So the energy uh is the recharger . We already know that . Just a normal battery . Okay . The chip-on-print is a normal one .
B :  Yeah . We have batteries .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Regular .
A :  Okay , the case is just a plastic one .
C :  Yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one . You have the simple one , regular and advanced . So it's b should be regular uh the second .
A :  Yeah , re Yeah , regular . Yeah , okay . Yeah , regular .
A :  Okay .
C :  I think I'll just check it .
A :  And we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel .
B :  Yes .
A :  That's pretty much it .
C :  Yeah .
B :  User interface concept .
A :  And a flashy light .
A :  So uh I'm not sure . But we do I don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . But
B :  I dunno either .
C :  Mm . Or should we do it in the next meeting ?
B :  Uh I_D_ and U_I_D_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board .
A :  Yeah . That's for the next one . That's for th
C :  So we should did it here ?
B :  So we're staying here ?
C :  Or should we do it in the next meeting ?
A :  Uh that I think that's the next next meeting .
C :  Okay .
A :  But you definitely get a specific instruction .
B :  Okay , so now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ?
C :  Yeah .
A :  But th think about something that's more rounded . Just And more
B :  Yeah , uh I dunno . But the iPod and etcetera , M_P_ three players , mobile phones .
A :  It has to be
A :  Uh a bit . Just just on the top or on the bottom .
B :  Just a bit cur Okay , I'll see if I can see any of those .
A :  Maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . O um if you draw it like this , you get a
A :  What the fuck is it ?
A :  Okay . Mm
A :  Doesn't work . You see what I mean ? If I draw here
C :  What ?
A :  It draws about four centimetres lower than Nah okay . Just .
C :  Oh .
C :  Okay .
A :  Maybe you can make it like this .
A :  And this is all the wheel for volume . So that you just um It's all rounded , so you can do uh turn this one . Yeah , but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it .
C :  Like a very big scroll-wheel .
C :  Okay .
A :  Maybe , I dunno .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay , so we have this at the moment .
C :  I think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted .
B :  Yeah , you Yeah .
A :  Okay , so we'd have this . Is that okay ?
C :  Yeah . I think it's probably better . Yeah , but maybe we can make a a plastic , so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . Only if you use your finger .
B :  Yeah , that's a little problem , of course , as well .
A :  And
B :  Yeah , maybe you just have to make it uh
B :  That's not scrollable too easy .
A :  Like this . And uh what's the channel choose ? Where do we uh put that ?
C :  I think in middle .
A :  Still on the bottom or
B :  Uh wh what is the middle part ?
A :  That's the numbers .
C :  Uh I think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle .
B :  Numbers , okay .
B :  Yeah , I agree as well .
B :  Use the dz
A :  It doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . Because you already have the volume here , so You can also put it here one butt and the other one there .
A :  Next to each other . back and forth . So you can also can put it all on the top , and this , you keep this empty . Because you have to hold it as well .
B :  Yeah , that's right .
C :  Or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below .
A :  But that's not want to zap very quick , so
B :  Yeah , I think uh zapping is the highest priority . And then you use those uh
C :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Is this a opportunity , or you don't want a different
B :  Yeah , of course uh .
C :  Uh but I think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , so
A :  Why ?
C :  Because then it's it's easy to know m if I push the the the up
A :  But still the next It's still the next one . Doesn't make
C :  Yeah , but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , and down button is If you put them
A :  Yeah , but fo from left to right is exactly the same . It ma it doesn't make a big difference .
B :  Yeah . I I think it's
C :  But uh but I I think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing .
B :  It's it's obvious , I think .
D :  Yeah , that's not not It's not al uh always the same . Every remote control's uh different .
A :  But it's exactly th
C :  In uh On most on most remote controls . So so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time .
B :  Yeah , I think
A :  I dunno . I You already have the volume on the side , so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . So it's uh
B :  No , uh I think
B :  Yeah . I think it's s so simple you just
C :  I dunno .
C :  Okay .
A :  So but that's for that's for you , 'cause it's
B :  Yeah , okay I'll d I'll take a look at it .
A :  Okay , so hmm .
A :  What did What else we have to discuss about ? I dunno .
B :  Think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ?
D :  Yeah , we have to care that it r uh looks really new . Because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh
D :  uh square uh remote control . 'Cause wha what I see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And the LED .
B :  No , you have uh It is Uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic . You have to look at that image of the iPod .
C :  Yeah , but i i it should be round in in shape . So
D :  Yes . Okay .
B :  More that uh kind of style .
D :  And a bit uh
B :  Not not the old grey black
A :  Uh Yeah .
D :  Some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have
B :  Where you can put a ve Uh we have If we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo .
A :  Yeah . Uh the logo was has to be on there . Yeah , that's right .
D :  Uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? Uh five or something ? Or more or
A :  Yeah , five . Let's give five .
B :  Maybe you can buy separate ones and uh
D :  And um uh uh buy the product . You buy , you get one . And uh basic . Or you can choose one uh if you buy the project .
B :  Yeah . Um I think Yeah .
C :  No , tha that will be
B :  That's your choice , I think huh .
A :  So y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? Is that is that a good good opportunity ? So you could put it like that , okay .
B :  Yes .
C :  Yeah , so top down . Hmm ?
D :  Yeah , you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station .
C :  Do we have to design that w as well ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh I'm not sure .
C :  The docking station ?
B :  Yeah , I think so .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah , we can b
B :  But th Yeah , that can be very simple .
B :  Least .
D :  It c it could be just just a square , just a packet .
C :  Yeah , just a recharger .
B :  Yeah , just where you're around something .
B :  Li Yeah , we had one example .
C :  But we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well .
B :  Mm . Mm .
D :  Yeah , but that's a round one . Maybe we can choose then .
B :  Which w
B :  Here you see one that's very round .
C :  Oh yeah , okay .
B :  So I think that can be all kind of shapes .
A :  But maybe you can just round up the corners a bit .
A :  That's all . Yeah .
C :  Of the remote control ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah Yeah .
A :  Just round it up .
B :  Yeah , so y you don't want uh this uh like the iPod . But
A :  No . Yeah . Yeah .
B :  More rounded .
B :  Yeah , I think it will just look like more like this one . Since it's This is also rounded . I think i
A :  No , just just the corners .
B :  Yeah okay , tho those are al already a bit cornered . Mm
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , but we can we can do all kinds of uh As long as it isn is in two D_ we can use all kind of round shapes .
A :  Shapes .
B :  Yeah okay , but then we have to think of something totally new .
C :  Not in depth .
C :  Yeah , but Yeah , if if we want to make it
C :  kind of , yeah , new .
B :  I've uh I had a lot of picture of old ones . And all curves have already been done .
A :  It's a bit annoying , isn't it ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  What do we do wrong ? Hmm . Just just more like this and not uh a square . Okay .
B :  Yeah okay , yeah well
C :  Yeah , but we could do a lot of , lot more curving .
C :  I would do it
B :  Yeah . I know we can do a lot more , but
D :  Yeah , it
C :  Like in this kind of shape or
D :  Uh it's very annoying . Okay .
C :  I dunno .
C :  I dunno if it's handy .
B :  I think it will only look more like the old remote controls .
D :  Uh
C :  This ? The olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah okay . But uh I had a lot of pictures Oh I can show you here
B :  what the old ones look like .
C :  Mm .
B :  Curves , curves .
C :  Yeah .
B :  You've more there as well .
C :  Yeah , okay .
B :  It wasn't very small one .
C :  Yeah .
B :  very simple .
B :  That is for elderly .
A :  So we have to make a decision , what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have .
C :  Yeah , I don't know .
D :  Yeah .
B :  I think if w My opinion . If we just uh take the iPod , and the same look . So uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours .
D :  Yeah .
B :  And uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . No rubber buttons or something . Just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . More like the M_P_ three player M_ um P_ M_ P_ three player .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
A :  And you have the scroll button inside . Okay . But why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? Of Skip that one as well .
B :  Yes . Just a simple scrollb
D :  Yeah .
B :  Doesn't have to be .
A :  Okay . Yeah , it's cool .
C :  Yeah , though that's a trend . If we want to make it . But yeah , I'm not a Trendwatcher , you are . So
D :  Uh the t the trend is
A :  Rubber spongy .
D :  spongy and fruity . But yeah .
C : 
B :  Yeah . No . Spongy and
C :  Spongeball kinda .
D :  It's not not a lot of trends I uh I found uh
A :  Okay , so we have s still one minute left . So just I think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square .
D :  Uh
B :  Mm .
C :  Okay . Yeah , I d I don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff .
D :  It The th th
A :  No .
D :  Yeah .
A :  But I I think it's still for older people . You j still have older people . It's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , like f Whatever . Just you have a normal
D :  There is one
C :  Yeah , but we're we're aiming at a young public .
D :  There's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , and I hope we can uh make it look not like the iPod itself . It must have uh uh uh a very different
B :  Yeah , idea . But you're If you look at the way remote controls are now
D :  Yeah , they're all the same .
B :  And if you make it look like the iPod
A :  But i it is it is it is already fancy . Because of the lights on the bottom of it . That's already fancy . Uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . Make it in in yellow or something . Just like the colours of Real Reaction .
B :  Yeah okay . So that's already a very big change compared to
C :  Hmm .
B :  Ye yeah . Well uh
C :  Yeah , we could do that .
B :  Could .
D :  Uh yeah , but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow .
A :  Yeah .
B :  No , I think Oh .
A :  It's right .
B :  Think the scroll wheel won't be very big . Since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . So it will just be a small
A :  Yeah .
B :  small scroll wheel . So it won't uh stick out much .
A :  Yeah . Maybe the ones we are going to draw there . Maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this . Because it doesn't work properly .
A :  So maybe you have to ask her .
D :  No .
B :  Yeah okay . Well , maybe we can just open images there , and I'll paint and paint .
A :  Okay . Yeah . That's probably
B :  I'll be able to do a better job .
D :  If you set the pen yeah , he will draw here .
D :  Doesn't work .
A :  Okay , so just finish it . So we make it a bit like m that one probably .
D :  Yeah , I'll see it .
A :  Yeah . Is that okay ?
B :  Bu Yeah , I agree more like iPod .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , only the colour and the flashy light and the We just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition .
B :  Yes . Just a
B :  Speech . Yeah , do we s keep that ? Yeah , I think
A :  Or keep that ? It's okay . But you'd definitely need a
C :  S Uh yeah , I don't know . Yeah , I think so . And we we have to build in a microphone and
B :  Well uh then it w
A :  advanced chip .
D :  Uh
B :  Well that's very easy . We already have uh the beeping of the home station , so
C :  Yeah , and I do I don't know anything about that . I d I didn't receive any information on speech recognition , so
D :  No .
B :  Uh strange that I received the information about that .
D :  Oh that's hard . But
A :  So
D :  Uh the ma the main points I I I uh just said .
D :  We have to be original and uh technological innovative . Becau Yeah . But
A :  Can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , okay ?
D :  Ma
B :  So shall we it open then ? So we can put all the
A :  Yeah .
A :  The function of that in there . Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  And we need a Probably we need a uh advanced chip then .
C :  Fine .
C :  Yeah , we probably do .
A :  But it doesn't say anything about it , does it ?
B :  Yeah .
C :  No .
B :  Oh yeah , I
D :  But we don't have any f information about the cost .
B :  No .
D :  We started with information about the cost was now th
B :  I just I just received the
C :  Yeah , uh I have I have some some information about the cost . But just a about the chip .
B :  Yeah .
D :  And how much is the chip ? The the the
C :  I don't know how much , but
B :  Yeah , our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . This is a very small electronic unit , will give a standard answer after it recognise a question .
C :  Just in inexpensive or
D :  And how how does it work ? Is it
B :  Doesn't say . Just You say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample .
B :  Because uh
B :  So it works like uh good morning remote control , and then the remote control says good morning .
A :  It doesn't has to say anything . Just You have to just talk to
D :  No . Does it say does it say something back ?
B :  Yeah uh th that's just It's a No . Yeah , it Well that's integrated in the chip , so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it .
A :  Okay , we have to stop it now . So just
A :  Okay , that's a r That's that's a advanced
C :  But i it's a separate chip .
B :  I dunno , but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well .
D :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , I don't know anything about this , but Nah .
D :  Um
A :  Yeah , we just decide not to put it in , because it's too difficult .
C :  I dunno .
B :  Well it it would be would be a good feature feature .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , we just put it in , because it's a good feature . We have to stop now . Okay , just We have to stop it now .
B :  Okay . No no worries about the cost , etcetera . And there's a chip in it that will Okay .
D :  Fine .
A :  Okay , welcome everyone to our next meeting . I'm busy writing and busy leading the meeting , but um I've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda I think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . Um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . Um once again I will try to uh write some minutes which I just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder ,
A :  which was quite some typing . Um today we once again have uh three presentations , if I'm right , and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . And just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . Okay , well
A :  I'd say let's start with the first presentation . Um in the same order as last time ? Okay .
D :  'Kay .
C :  W sure .
B :  Mm . Alright .
A :  Well , take it away .
C :  Okay uh welcome you all . Components design , um uh first of all uh I would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things I uh uh elaborate some of the things I did . I I elaborated on the concept . What should be um
C :  uh said about uh the components , uh its properties and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls .
C :  Uh well first of all I've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed . Uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . I would like to uh give you an idea of uh how I thought about .
D :  Don't destroy my giraffe .
C :  Giraffe's gone now . Okay um the case was is made from rubber , I suppose . There's one of the because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control and they break uh becau the uh titanium was also an option . But uh it's a very expensive material . Uh rubber is , I think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh
D :  Drop it .
B :  Hmm .
C :  for our remote control . Um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . Uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour . Uh titanium uh you have to paint it and with that uh it's possible to scratch it or uh yeah make it ugly . Uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . But it's a very strong material .
C :  Um I h I had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved . Uh so it's t two dimensional . I think it's uh it's best to draw oh green .
B :  It's a colour .
D :  Bright colour . Fancy colour . Forward .
C :  Uh
C :  New . Blank .
D :  You have to go t
C :  Okay .
C :  Let's make it uh black .
C :  Okay . I thought of an idea like this .
C :  Oh that . Um delete .
C :  Blank . Okay .
C :  So it also looks nice when it's on your table . So you get uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , but it's c it's stands .
D :  Oh it's a side view .
C :  Side view yes it's side view so uh I I'm not technically good at th three D_ modelling , but . Um uh it's just an idea I had so it's uh it's very uh so its also looks nice when it's on the table . Um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . Uh I thought about uh the L_C_D_ touch screen , which is uh is easy to clean too .
C :  One of the great uh advantages of the L_C_D_ screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff . And um it should be made of strong plastic and it should be bright . Well I already uh s uh explained some properties of that material and I think uh well we also we almost concluded about that uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . So uh
D :  True .
C :  uh that's all about uh the buttons . Uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . Questions , ? Okay .
D :  No no no no no . Just looking .
B :  No .
C :  And they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . And next step is the chip uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . Uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip but I think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , so uh there should be some more uh investigation on that side .
C :  Uh my personal preferences uh I also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . That was correct , wasn't it ? Okay . I think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well , business colours I thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , so yeah , it needs colour ,
C :  Okay they should be m sh they should be in mind , wasn't it ?
A :  but I don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour .
C :  Okay so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan ?
A :  It must be recognisable .
C :  Okay okay . Well that's possible of course . We could make a little R_ and R_ on the top of the machine . Uh so they are pretty boring , I suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls which peopl uh who people
B :  You can put the R_ and R_ .
C :  in which people will find they're uh interesting . And uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . Uh s as I said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely imp instead of uh of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium .
C :  And I personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , because it yeah it makes sense . Okay . Well that's all about my uh my findings .
B :  Alright .
A :  Okay , thank you .
D :  Mm mm mm . Next .
B :  I will go next .
B :  Alright so I thought a little bit about the interface . Uh how it should look . And uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an L_C_D_ screen , so I had to uh look on that . And the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of .
B :  Uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . And this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device and it answers you . And they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . And so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning Joe or what's your name . This uh and there's an easy way to uh program that uh you say record into the device into the speaker and then you say the question and three seconds later you say the answer and then when you say the question it gives you the answer .
C :  Mm .
B :  Um perhaps it's useful , perhaps for because people um lose the remote , they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something . And perhaps we could uh implement that . And then I have to go out of the presentation because I tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like but I can't draw , so uh don't make too much of it .
C :  Mm .
A :  Mm .
C :  Mm .
D :  It's true .
C :  Oh my God .
B :  I tried to uh the L_C_D_ screen I tried to sort of to draw . I thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . I don't know if there is an icon for the program , but yeah . So uh and then the buttons above and uh below the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon .
C :  Not just a P_ . Oh okay .
D :  P_ yeah , just a P_ .
C :  .. .
D :  Where's where's the button for two ?
B :  Um .
B :  I forgot that one . I thought I forgot something , but uh . And uh and uh the numbers , that should be a bit larger I think it's not really on scale and and so forth . Um an options button . And I thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart because it's not really options , I think . It's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the T_V_ and that kind of uh thing . So could call it settings or something . But this is a bit uh how I thought it . And uh the L_C_D_ uh somewhere on the remote . Perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should ,
D :  Okay .
C :  Ah .
D :  Doesn't matter .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  No .
C :  Yep .
B :  so that it's better in your hand or something uh . But uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that .
C :  Oh okay , yeah .
B :  Uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of
B :  and then you should get the other options with what what you could do and that you could do with something like this this . And uh it's also uh I thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . And older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . So they want to u use one button and then something happens , and not choose with uh this kind of uh And you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things .
C :  Oh yeah , .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
B :  That's an option . And that was my uh finding dinge .
A :  Thanks .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Now our third
C :  Go Danny , go Danny .
A :  team member with his presentation .
D :  Okay , I'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . The trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours ,
D :  material and stuff .
D :  'Kay .
D :  The method I used was
D :  Like I told I watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . So we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . Findings I made . The most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy .
D :  The second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , okay , like the L_C_D_ screen that's quite innovative so that should be great meeting for this . And the third thing is it should be easy to use . I think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use .
D :  The personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff .
C :  Fruity ? Fruity .
B :  Grass green .
D :  Yeah . Like that . The round shapes ,
D :  and soft material m materials like the rubber . It should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s Sponge Bob like things . Th
C :  Mm . Okay .
B :  Let's build it into a sponge .
C : 
D :  Elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . They liked square shapes with round edges .
D :  And hard materials like wood , um titanium . They those kind of materials they liked . This is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours ,
D :  innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . And then I th I I personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like
A :  Oh y
D :  this or something .
D :  It's it's a bit like a banana . And the colour should be yellow , or something . And for the elderly people just plain old . Because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , or was it two colours ? Different colours , yeah . We should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . I think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the iPod or something , with round squares . Simple but
B :  It was one remote , I think , different colours .
D :  easy to use . So that's it .
C :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
A :  So for the older people , a more traditional uh form .
D :  That is my
D :  Yeah , like the older o older colours I can maybe
B :  You could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . I don't know which shape you should should take , but .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Colours th the elderly people
A :  Yeah , I guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh
B :  Yeah .
C :  Changing just the shape of the uh remote control ?
A :  the shape of it .
B :  Perhaps you could find something in the middle . Round but square .
C :  Yeah , s round corners , but s but square , yeah .
A :  But maybe then both groups won't buy it .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Uh i i if you do it uh uh square , with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh i Do you know what I mean ?
C :  Yeah I know what you mean , kind of like a .
B :  wait , like like this uh a bit .
C :  Yeah .
B :  So it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh
B :  round .
C :  Kinda like a beer glass . Yeah .
B :  So but then
C :  I know what you mean .
B :  Same sides .
C :  It's also easy to to have to to put in your hand .
B :  But that's uh
B :  Yeah but that's also how other remotes are shaped , so that's uh But perhaps that's a good thing , so that's easy to use . People know the
C :  Yeah .
C :  Will recognise that's as a remote control . Uh when I saw your d Oh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh
D :  Look something like that . Autumn colours like red , brown . They liked the wood a lot . So maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . And a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things .
C :  Huh .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , kinda like old cars , uh
B :  Yeah .
C :  Let's put it all together .
B :  Swords .
D :  Those kind of Yeah , those kind of things . So you see the big difference between the young people ? Fresh , exciting . And the old people , old and boring .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But that's easily to do with the colour , I think .
D :  So Sorry ? Yeah I think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape . Because otherwise we have to get different shapes , and colour way easier than yeah the shapes .
B :  That's easy to do with the colours , I think .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh .
A :  Yeah we think so too .
D :  In material yeah rubber , rubber is , like I said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones and the old people like plain wood . So we have to decide if we're going to use
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  real hard rubber , or soft rubber . Or something something between that .
B :  Yeah think uh Also in between .
C :  Soft rubber .
D :  Yeah soft rubber which you can you can feel in it .
C :  Yeah I know what you Um .
B :  I don't think you should be able to mould it , but
D :  Or No . Or or wh what's something harder . No no no but but you have to like like like a a eraser or something . That's the bit you can press it in , or something harder .
C :  It should shouldn't be .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh .
B :  Bit like this kind of rubber . This uh
D :  Yeah , something like this , yeah .
B :  But it's quite hard , this .
D :  Yeah it's quite hard but you can press it in . It's feels kind s spongy .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Spongy .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Something .
B :  I don't think it's rubber .
D :  No .
D :  N n n
A :  So we need a spongy feeling .
B :  Uh did you have something about uh
D :  Are you going to invite Sponge Bob , maybe he can
C :  Yeah .
B :  So we should first decide about shape , I think . Which uh Then you can fit the L_C_D_ screen in it , and can decide uh .
C :  Ding ding .
D :  Yeah I think that's the better thing to do .
C :  Um I also s uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control and the L_C_D_ screen was uh rather small . Um .
D :  Yeah w I think that L_C_D_ screen should be like
B :  Yeah it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit Yeah .
C :  .. .
C :  This was your size , but I think it should be larger .
D :  Yeah three quarter of the of the
C :  Yeah , three quarters . So uh so you don't have to put your oh .
D :  Yeah the buttons won't get that small when the L_C_D_ screen is
C :  Uh new , blank .
C :  So uh when you get this uh
B :  Ooh
C :  Uh kinda like this .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Or should it be larger ? Larger ? Because you want to put your hands You want
D :  Larger I think .
B :  But if you pu Now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen . Perhaps that's best .
D :  Yeah becau because you have
C :  Yeah . Your thumb here .
D :  Yeah okay , true , true , true true .
B :  But not on the screen because Yeah that's uh that's an idea .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Looks a bit like a Game Boy now .
C :  Because when you put your f Yeah but if yo if you make the the L_C_D_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll you'll always get some You Yeah . Going to be very greasy and stuff .
B :  You always touch it , yeah .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .
D :  But it won't get that small because you have how much ? Nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen .
B :  Yeah .
D :  One to zero , the two digit ,
C :  Yeah you don't want it too small . How yeah how large
D :  You have to you have to Because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time .
C :  Yeah they have thick fingers . But if you wanna make it in international , Japanese uh people got uh rather small hands
D :  Yeah true , but Yeah , we have we have the zoom option , right ?
C :  and we got these large
C :  Zoom opt Ah yeah of course , yeah . You can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . And we won't include a a pen , or something to point , hey , we we want to do it with our fingers , right ?
D :  Yeah .
D :  No . Yeah .
C :  Your fingers , yeah . You don't want uh Because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Y you could include a pen .
D :  Use a pen You you c you can lose the pen .
A :  Yeah but I think people want to use a remote with with their fingers because th they're used to that and
D :  Yeah the fingers , yeah .
B :  Yeah o yeah , if they think it's handy to use a pen .
B :  Yeah I think this uh this is a good size for the screen . I don't know how how large the actual remote should be but a little bit like this , or something .
A :  And maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but that that can be with plain soft tissue . Yeah , you can buy those at
C :  Yeah You can do whatever uh any uh cloth .
A :  Okay well maybe , if I can interrupt you , maybe I should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision .
C :  Sure .
A :  So we can discuss these points .
A :  those points um
A :  energy question mark . How how should we uh supply the thing with energy and how are we going to do it with separate docking station and then put in it . Uh chip on print and case . Those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , but I hope you have ideas about them .
B :  I think energy were batteries and then uh and uh Yeah .
C :  The docking station .
A :  Yeah . So that's the the the first point . We already decided that on the previous meeting .
D :  Maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries which you can recharge through the docking station .
C :  W
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Just like with the telephone .
D :  So if the badg the batteries are dead
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  then you can re you can uh change them .
C :  I kinda like your
C :  Yeah you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ? Mouse . Computer mouse .
D :  Yeah yeah yeah like those .
C :  Kinda like those kind of batteries .
D :  Yep .
B :  but it should be th I think normal batteries , not not like two or two uh
D :  Yeah , normal plain you No normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Simple rechargeable uh batteries .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Um what was with the chip on print ?
C :  The chip on print ? Um
C :  Uh you gotta f Yeah . I think so . Chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a
D :  Print plate .
C :  We also discussed that . Didn't we ?
A :  Yeah but how did this how does that with a L_C_D_ screen ?
A :  You still have a
A :  print plate .
C :  Uh
D :  Yeah yeah yeah . You always have a print plate .
C :  Beg your pardon ?
D :  You always have a print plate , right ? Always , so
C :  Yeah sure , of course , yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I dunno what w what we have to decide about that .
A :  Yeah well it's a good question . It just was in there and I didn't have any information about it , but
C :  Well uh chip on print , I think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button . But when you got a L_C_D_ screen , with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place , for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen , uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same . When you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place and you got on the and on the
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , okay .
D :  But
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah okay , but the p print plate of L_ L_C_D_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , so that that's not of any discussion , I think .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Well you need some kind of C_P_U_ , I guess .
C :  I suppose so .
D :  Mm , I don't I dunno I don't think that's
C :  It is a simple C_P_U_ but it doesn't
D :  Yeah yeah okay but I d I I don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple L_C_D_ . Yeah , it's quite a simple L_C_D_ screen . I think they don't need that big of C_P_U_ .
C :  Yeah because it has to uh b
C :  Yeah but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume .
D :  Yeah , okay , true true .
D :  True .
C :  So it has to have some kind of a
C :  calculation unit or C_P_U_
C :  to know uh in which state you are and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment .
A :  Mm-hmm . Because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the L_C_D_ screen .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen . And the case , yeah we already discussed the case , we wanted to make it from rubber and uh
A :  Yeah .
B :  It's rubber . Yeah but but a hard rubber like this ? Or softer rubber or Yeah .
C :  Uh hard rubber I think . That's the easy to ha uh to to uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  It bounces back from the floor where you throw it . Yeah yeah this in different colours ?
C :  Yeah . Yeah sure , look .
D :  We have different colours .
D :  So the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ?
D :  No I don't think , I think
D :  it's more round than square .
B :  Yeah it's a bit . But I think it should be a bit longer , perhaps .
D :  So it meets I think it meets more the young people than the older people .
B :  Yeah . I think so too .
A :  Yeah . But that's what we want , .
D :  Yeah , that's our target . Yeah .
C :  It's our main target .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Lower than forty years , I think
D :  it was .
C :  Well and how about my idea uh of making it um
C :  with one single curve ?
D :  Oh yeah that that I think I thought that was a quite good
C :  So i
B :  Yeah .
C :  Because it's a gadget and you want to show it off , of course .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah yeah you have a fancy design , then , right away . So
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh .
D :  You can put it on your table with the L_C_D_ screen , you don't have to put it get it in your hand , you can put it next to you and then dive it in and . Yeah .
C :  Because it Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , that's a good idea .
C :  It's a lot easier .
B :  Yeah , alright .
D :  So
C :  So , so you got uh Did you write that down ? Uh got a single curved uh rubber
A :  Okay so
B :  And then
C :  f uh fancy coloured remote control .
D :  You can't you You can't oh , you c you can draw it on your paper and then load it on the
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , you can uh It's pretty easy but
A :  Yeah but I wrote it down .
B :  And
D :  And load it on the the user the server .
A :  What about the user interface , there are also some some questions uh about the concepts I think you have some ideas on that . You you showed your drawing .
B :  Yeah , I had what I just uh I should again .
B :  I miss a few buttons , but .
B :  Well .
B :  At least uh what we should also have on , I just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh
B :  if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now . This
D :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah , you have to go back .
D :  Yeah uh uh .
D :  Isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ?
B :  I don't know . I think it's
D :  With the minus and the plus . I think it's
B :  I don't know . I I thought it was uh easier to handle this way , but I don't know what they think .
D :  easier than
D :  Yeah .
C :  Sorry ?
B :  Would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ?
A :  Mm .
D :  For sound and channel .
C :  Depends on the screen . If you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . If you make it uh in a rectangle
B :  Right well if we make it like this , I think if you
D :  Yeah .
C :  I so it's it's it's it's
B :  put it like this
C :  Square .
D :  I think it's it's easier to have it something like
D :  Oh a button uh minus here , plus over here .
D :  A minus here , plus over here .
C :  Oh , okay .
D :  And on here .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The other buttons and on here the top .
D :  The options and then you have something like uh the P_ over here ,
B :  Yeah . But I think I wou
D :  and the sound .
B :  I think that's a matter of what you're used to . I think I would put a plus and a min uh here . And then the P_ in the mid in the middle and the sound uh in the middle .
D :  Something uh
C :  Uh .
D :  Something like
D :  Sh
C :  Take your time .
D :  Plus minus plus uh
B :  Almost .
D :  minus .
B :  Yeah but I think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus .
D :  Yeah I think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb .
B :  Yeah but I think Yeah I don't know . Perhaps I have some examples . I don't know
C :  We'll leave that to the usability engineering then .
D :  Who's the usability engineering ? She is .
B :  That's me . But I'm going to look if I've got some examples 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . The 'Cause they can use that better . Yeah .
C : 
D :  Oh .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Um
C :  Consistency .
D :  Oh I have that those s numbers .
B :  I
B :  Here is our here are uh
D :  Or a good watch . B
B :  I don't really know .
A :  Everybody's searching in his data .
D :  Channel selection . Per hour one hundred and sixty eight . Volume selection four times an hour
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but But I mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Uh
C :  So not how much n not how often it's used , but
B :  W what's what's usual or normal . Yes I'm looking here . But here's it's below , here also , and now here's here's next to each other .
D :  Yeah , that depends on on on the remote .
C :  Uh .
B :  I think it's it's a
D :  I think because I have two televisions at home . One is horizontal , one is vertical , so it depends .
C :  Yeah it does it doesn't really matter , but
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Depends .
C :  Uh .
B :  I think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , because you go higher and down . And the the pay the the the program is next to each other , because you would go further and back .
D :  Yeah , lower .
D :  True .
B :  That's how it's is usually when I look here
C :  Okay , um .
B :  that's what I see .
C :  Let's cut to the chase .
D :  It's got to change .
A :  Yeah well I think we have we don't have to decide about that now how where we will put the buttons just the
B :  I don't know .
D :  Yeah is it is user interface .
B :  Yeah .
A :  concepts .
D :  Component .
B :  This concept is in the actual design , but you should know where you would place a
C :  Okay , well le
C :  Yeah .
C :  Interface , yeah .
B :  And the speech uh shall we implement that ? Or uh
A :  Yeah well we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ?
D :  Yeah I think it's it's easy for that , where are you , but then it says I'm here .
C :  Technologies , uh .
C :  Yeah . Makes it possible to
B :  Yeah . But then you should also find a place You could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . You can talk into the corner . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah , a microphone , yeah .
C :  Not even necessary , because a lotta you can make a very sensitive microphone , so it makes it possible to uh just put it arou uh underneath it or on the on the bottom of the uh remote .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah maybe at the bottom where you can can hel hold it with you hand that there's also a microphone uh
B :  But
B :  Yeah , that's also .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Right .
A :  over there .
B :  So , in the middle or something .
C :  But that's not import I think that's not im very important because yeah , it doesn't matter where the microphone is .
A :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  but you should uh decide where you want to put it . Right ?
C :  Ah okay , sure , okay , well tha
D :  Um I think where it isn't seen
C :  Underneath ?
D :  the most .
C :  Indeed . It shouldn't be uh very uh visible .
D :  Inside .
B :  You could p you could put it in a logo of the company .
A :  Yeah . Well maybe just in the the spot you just pointed out
D :  Yeah . I i between the round of the R_ .
C :  Yeah sure , why no
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  because I think it should be in a in an important position where people can see it , because it is the the unique uh idea of our remote , huh , the the speech control .
B :  Yeah . So where do you want to put it ?
D :  Yeah , okay .
A :  Well maybe where the one hand
C :  Yeah but it doesn't makes it uh any more fancy because you get to see uh
B :  Yeah actually it does because it you can you can find it better if you use it .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah bu but
B :  It's a way for you to uh
C :  Uh .
B :  So it makes more sense just 'cause other remotes don't have that .
C :  Yeah , okay .
A :  But are we talking about the button , or about the microphone ? Yeah because a microphone is very small thing , but you can make it look like it's big so as its its really an important function of the remote .
B :  About a microphone , there is no button .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I think the left s under corner should be the best .
D :  Where isn't i it isn't most in sight .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Well put it there . I don't mind . That doesn't doesn't really matter .
D :  I think .
D :  No . Actually doesn't .
C :  Okay . So ?
B :  Alright .
B :  Any more uh
A :  So well uh type , supplements ,
C :  Interface type .
A :  anything . Yeah , well we already s discussed that , huh , the the L_C_D_ and
C :  The L_C_D_ yeah , uh supplements well the supplement is to yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I think I thought the , like you said , like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy . I think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen . If you want to go back you have to back button go back , if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Hey , .
B :  Um yeah . Yeah the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah .
C :  Use the scroll . Yeah I think so too . So why not , on on side .
D :  Yeah ? You do like it ?
B :  Or at least Yeah I don't know if it's really the scroll , but the menu they like most , and I think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh
C :  Fast , yeah .
D :  Yeah I think it is is faster . Becau I think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options , but if you don't have a lot of option then
C :  So if you've got a settings , if you
C :  Yes .
B :  But you have it's f uh we have five or four or something .
C :  You have a lot of options , because when you use Yeah you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . So then it's uh very handy to to scroll down , you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . Just put it on the side and it's very easy to use .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Uh-huh .
D :  Yeah , okay , true .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
D :  Okay , no problem .
A :  And I think I would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side which you can touch and
C :  Yeah , yeah .
B :  Yeah . It's also different .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Okay .
A :  Okay . Well there's our five minutes uh warning . Um any more uh questions about about the design or the user interface or different components , everyone ?
D :  Um .
D :  No , colours are clear , shape is clear , material is clear .
A :  Everybody think they can can
C :  Okay , what's the standard colour ?
A :  work for that ? Is there a standard colour ?
D :  And a standard , yeah we don't no we have different colour . How many colours are we going to
C :  I I You got you got different colours , but you should have a standard colour .
B :  You should you should have a black one because uh I think black is standard .
D :  Black . Yeah , black I think is is the standard .
C :  Black ? With the with the yellow uh
B :  But if you want to be different , then uh
D :  Dark grey , something like this this colour or something .
C :  Just a regular uh remote colour . And then have uh different covers uh to use .
D :  Yeah like like yeah . Or or silver .
D :  I think it's better to have silver nowadays .
B :  Silver .
C :  Silver , yeah .
D :  I think you see more silver than black .
A :  Yeah .
C :  You see a lot of t uh silver televisions .
A :  But still silver and black are well silver is new but also traditional , so uh
B :  Silver rubber .
D :  Yeah the the silver black are our main colours . Yeah . I think we have silver , black and between those is like I dunno s five colours between them or something .
A :  Yeah w what about a yellow thing , I mean it
C :  Yeah y I think it's better to
D :  Yeah yeah yeah it'll be a banana yellow , we have .
A :  could be ugly , but it's definitely fancy .
D :  R red .
B :  But yeah .
C :  Yeah th yeah . That's right . But if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy .
D :  Green , wood , brown . Yeah .
D :  True .
C :  When you use titanium , silver is fancy , but when you use silver rubber , it isn't fancy . Silver has to shine , and rubber doesn't shine .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Especially when it's made of soft rubber like this .
B :  Yeah .
C :  You understand ?
D :  Yeah , I understand .
A :  Yeah I would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue , just
D :  Yeah o of course . The fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , dark red and brown .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Just all kind of colour .
C :  Fruity . Fruity loops .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . Maroon . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
A :  Okay , so
B :  And and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh
B :  Is it
A :  Who's pinging ? You are pingin Okay . I thought we Okay , so uh that wraps it up ? Everybody knows uh what to do ? Well I wrote it down here . I wrote it down here what to do um . The next meeting is once again in thirty minutes . Um here are the individual actions , and especially notice that uh the Industrial Designer and the User Interface Designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board , and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach .
D :  No .
C :  You ping .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Well not what to do . Not what to do . Look .
B :  Well I don't know what to do , but .
C :  Okay .
B :  Ooh .
B :  Right .
D :  S tough .
B :  Yeah .
D :  We'll be available .
B :  But do we have to We'll work together , but do we have to stay here , or do we
A :  Well I I'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out . I don't know . Okay well that was what I had to say , uh ,
B :  Right .
B :  Yes . Okay .
C :  Thin I think we should work .
B :  Yeah I think .
A :  final thoughts from anyone , or ? We're finished . Okay , well thank you very much .
B :  No .
D :  No .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Finished .
C :  Thank you very much .
B :  So we have to keep talking English now ?
D :  Hello .
A :  .
A :  .
D :  Yes , I made it .
D :  English from now on .
D :  Drawing or
C :  . Just kidding .
A :  Yeah just testing .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm ?
A :  English .
A :  .
C :  So annoying .
A :  Break is over .
D :  Ooh it works .
A :  Whoo . Spicy .
D :  Spicy .
D :  Where are are all the other presentations ?
C :  I just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be yeah I think so . Yeah , conceptual design . What or whatever does it
D :  The conceptual or
D :  Ah . Because I see only my own presentation yeah .
C :  No no no , can you go back one ?
C :  Uh 'cause it has to be PowerPoint pre yeah components design , that's it .
D :  This ?
D :  I'll just put it in there .
A :  So , he's coming .
C :  . I did get a bit more done than the last time , 'cause I knew that I didn't have time so I just copy and paste everything into the
D :  Or not .
B :  Okay .
A :  Oh okay .
D :  Ah , I can't cut and paste it into the other folder but
A :  Ah . She . You can look at the final report , 'cause I have to record everything we are deciding and such , so I'm trying to write it down between everything else .
D :  Move to meeting room .
C :  Sometimes I have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , and also with I don't know how to use PowerPoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Oh .
D :  Yeah me too , .
D : 
B :  I I've got the same problem as well .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Here we go again . Welcome . Uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh f the remote control has to support . So who wants go .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yes . Me first again or yeah . Alright . Did you open it already or no . Ah .
A :  Yes ?
C :  Who wants to start ?
A :  Yeah sure . Doesn't matter .
B :  Oh . No . Yeah . No problem
A :  No .
D :  Ah .
D :  Yes .
D :  So welcome to the marketing presentation once again . Um this time about trendwatching .
D :  Uh well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . Uh it shows a number of developments . Uh I will address them uh in a moment . Um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public .
D :  Um well fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . And the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . So um the developments I will address them oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . So to give you an idea .
D :  Um well the developments ? Uh development one . Uh well most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . Instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . Um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface .
D :  And the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . Um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . I think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , so I don't expect that to be a problem .
C :  Sound .
C :  Yeah yeah uh uh .
D :  And the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . Um
D :  Well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . So um that kind of gets you this ratios . So fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  .
D :  Uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . Um well technolog technological innovation , we've covered that pretty much I guess . Um and easy to use , I don't think that will be problem . So my point of attention is especially this part . That this will be a crux . So that was the marketing uh presentation . I had only one document left .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And shall I go first ? So I
B :  Yeah . No . I I don't mi I don't mind . That's
D :  So kind of this
A :  Yeah yeah sure . No .
C :  Yeah ?
B :  Do you want to go first ? Okay . Yeah .
D :  So a k a small example . Kind of this this look . Uh nothing about the buttons but just sponge kind of thing , and and some fruit and colours I dunno . Just made a quick design .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Cool .
B :  It's better than than my uh drawing .
D :  Alright .
C :  Alright .
A :  Yeah you're just the user interface hmm ?
C :  Uh components .
B :  Yeah okay but I have to design the
A :  Yeah layout .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Oh no .
A :  Yeah okay .
D :  Yeah . It's okay .
A :  You probably opened it .
C :  Yeah true . Um
A :  F_ five .
D :  F_ five .
C :  Alright . So I'm dealing with the components design . Um let's see . I uh used some design examples we had uh from similar products . And I used uh possibilities from our manufacturing department about current components which will have to be implemented in the design . That's why I had to , wanted to go first .
C :  Well they gave me um an idea about what people want . We're f mainly focusing on this group , but I want to make the distinction clear . Uh I could not drag the pictures into the the slides so s so I don't have examples of how it looks like . But it comes down to what you uh what you think we should do with the spongey and the fruity looking uh type .
C :  If you , the young dynamic people want soft primary colours uh , which looks like fruits you know , you can and shapes that are curved and not uh solid straight lines anymore . So this basically um yeah goes on to what you were mentioning earlier .
C :  There is a lot of um factors involved in choosing the components . There's a lot of options that we have to discuss . Uh for example the energy source . we have four types . The basic battery . Uh we have a hand dynamo , which we yeah we Dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . Uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . Which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  And uh of course solar cells . But I dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product . So uh my yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in Scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know . So that's not cool either .
D :  Wi an indoors . Oh .
A :  Yeah okay .
A :  Calculator's can do it .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  So um for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . Single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . Or the double curved . Um I wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet , but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh the case materials . Well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . I would definitely go for rubber 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Um poo , this is a lot of text . I wasn't able to organise this yet . We have yeah several uh interface designs . Uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . So that's not really interesting .
B :  Yeah . Pushbuttons . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Electronics ? Yeah , maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use the advanced chip I think
C :  is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . Um
C :  Yeah . I think this is about it . Yeah I was working on some per personal preferences . I first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah I'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . But I really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy , where you have to move the thing to be able to use it .
B :  Yeah . Yeah . As an optional uh feature .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Or combine uh both with a with one uh
D :  I guess we can only choose one .
A :  Uh I think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the
C :  Yeah maybe we
B :  Okay .
C :  I can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . But it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again .
D :  Yeah . And it's more fun .
A :  Yeah I didn't receive any info uh .
C :  And it's also more fun yeah . I always chuck my uh remote control around , so
D :  Yeah , just playing with it and especially when the material's rubber . It can be done , I mean , you can't harm it , so it's a perfect combination I guess .
A :  Yeah .
A :  S yeah it's safe .
B :  And throw it .
C :  Yeah y exactly . You don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . So that's the end of it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
D :  So
C :  Uh go ahead .
A :  'Kay next .
D :  So double curved is like this , this , this , or
C :  No it means curved in two dimensions . So uh w single curved ? Uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . And double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . Like three D_ . Yeah .
D :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Also in in height ? Yeah okay .
A :  Uh
A :  Okay . Can we uh
B :  Yeah . One one uh very important thing I was uh yeah thinking about is the speech uh option . We were going to use that . Yeah . So um
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah um yeah that's one thing uh which I'm not sure uh of how to implement it uh into the remote control .
C :  Design ?
A :  Well the visual representation is not there with speech but you can
B :  No okay but it has to be combined with with the menu uh for functions and
A :  Yeah . Just yeah . I think you can just uh match the speech commands with the functions that are already present . So I don't think you have to design anything else for that .
B :  So okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Yeah with the programme .
B :  But do uh j do we uh do the speech just for the basic options , for the simple buttons ? For for everything , also for the advanced options ? Okay . Uh we have this very uh basic uh trendy design . Everybody says it so that's what's uh yeah um
A :  Both .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah in the in the last uh meeting we uh we were yeah putting the the simple and the advanced options separated . That's
B :  yeah obvious . Um yeah . Pressing the the menu option uh will disable uh all other options on your uh remote control .
B :  And only the the L_C_D_ panel will uh light up and then you can only uh change the yeah the options .
D :  And and the and the buttons that you need to control it , I guess .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um yeah design has to be very attractive but that's your your op your yeah . you have to uh delete this but this is the the the simple uh layout . Uh display on the upper side with the the menu button and maybe a some sort of cancel button or save button . I'm
A :  Yeah .
A :  That would be the back .
B :  The back .
D :  Yeah . Back and okay .
A :  Back and okay .
B :  Back and okay yeah . Uh
A :  You did read the minutes I wrote ? You did read the minutes I wrote ?
B :  What ?
B :  A little bit I think but not not everything w
C :  I
A :  Oh okay 'cause I pretty much summed up all the buttons there were . So
B :  Okay . Oh I uh didn't read that . But
A :  I hate doing work for nothing .
B :  But this is the the basic uh design uh for the for the m yeah for the buttons .
B :  Um
B :  I wanted to to categorise everything . Uh with a speech display uh yeah , sound , everything you you noted in your uh minutes . Um every pushbutton has uh has its own uh LED light . So you can uh yeah change uh m make it more trendy for for younger people . And uh if there are older people they wanted more uh yeah more uh luxurous so that's an a also an option .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Um that was it .
A :  That was it ? Okay . Uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  again . Ugh .
A :  Okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? Uh energy source , chip type , case type . And user interface . But I didn't see a clear distinction between these so I think what we have is okay . So we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . Uh the case would be doubly curved . So
D :  No .
D :  Rubber material .
C :  And rubber . Rubber material .
A :  Rubber material . And that's the only thing we have left .
C :  Yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function .
A :  Oh okay . No it's easy .
D :  So that's uh is that is that the advanced chip ?
C :  Yeah . Yeah . Otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . But we need more .
A :  Advanced chip . Okay .
D :  Wow .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Alright . Kinetic . Double curved .
C :  I'm just thinking , this is not my department , but I I'm not sure what this is gonna cost , to be able to m
A :  Too .
A :  Uh I didn't get any info on this . So
D :  .
C :  So 'cause we need to sell it for twenty five Euro a piece . That's gonna be difficult huh ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  The cost of making it should be twelve and a half ?
A :  I have total here .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah I don't know . I didn't get any information about that so
B :  .
B :  We're going to produce it in uh China so it's no problem .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Child labour man , we love it .
D :  Yeah , so it's cheap .
A :  Who doesn't . Uh let's see . Is there a new thing ?
D :  Um well the interface type supplements .
A :  Yeah the interface , maybe can
B :  Uh it's it's quite difficult because we we haven't got all the options uh yeah .
A :  Ooh .
A :  No . Uh do you have a picture of doubly curved case ?
A :  And could you put that in the group folder ? Of the project folder .
C :  Um let me see . Wait a sec .
D :  If you go to your homepage or something , you should
C :  Yeah I'm going there now .
D :  get your own information .
C :  Inspiration .
D :  I got my fresh and fyoo fruity uh picture uh also uh over there , so
A :  Ah you didn't draw it yourself . Ah .
C :  Well
D :  No . Too less time .
C :  Um yeah maybe it's
D :  Yeah , also the menu . Yeah that that w
B :  Yeah . This is the the menu I was uh looking uh at .
D :  Yeah . Yeah I was thinking of that also , with with a with a uh arrow . So that indicates that there's an menu under that menu .
C :  Maybe it's easier
B :  Yeah .
A :  Arrow . Yeah .
B :  Arrow yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah perfect .
B :  Yeah .
D :  So
A :  .
C :  Maybe it's easier if you guys come over here . S see this is the the the standard traditional type , where the form uh yeah serves the function , you know . It's like really basic . But this m is more appealing to old people and we don't want that .
A :  'S the target group .
B :  S yeah .
D :  Oh yeah .
A :  Yeah sure .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  This is what we're looking for . And th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions . Not only like this but it has to be exactly . It has to be kind of instead of the PlayStation , the module . It has to be like the the Game Cube , you know , where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . And
A :  Oh okay . I see . Yeah also like this . So you can hold it .
B :  Yeah .
B :  But it has also to it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people .
B :  Th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . So
C :  It ha
A :  .
A :  The children's story . Yeah I've got it .
C :  Yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually , 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . And
A :  Distinction . Yeah .
B :  Yeah . The colour
C :  Yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , you know , with the
B :  Yeah . Okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with LEDs uh beneath the the buttons . If you press a button and you can disable the the colour LEDs for for people that don't like it .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Mm .
C :  There is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights . Maybe we should consider this function . To customise it and so I mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours and people who want something , you know , different , or more uh design , they can go for one colour like uh for example this uh photo th camera .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Different .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Camera .
D :  Yeah . Cool . S underwater uh yeah .
A :  Yeah submarine .
C :  Personally I think it's really ugly .
A :  Well
B :  Yeah .
C :  Just give me the thing that it's inside there maybe I'm too old for this stuff . Yeah .
B :  Very cheap uh cheap look .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah but this this the is for the .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  So those I think are all my oh .
A :  Uh
D :  .
A :  Ah yeah bright colours .
D :  Yeah . Also a kind of rubber uh
C :  And this is , this is with the curved that I mean .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That's singly curved .
C :  Yeah . Yeah ?
A :  Okay .
D :  That should be nice .
A :  Well we could make a compromise between that . But I don't know if it's worth the effort .
C :  A compromise between what ?
A :  Uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved .
A :  So to appeal a little more to the all the public .
D :  So s
C :  This , this would be uh single curved uh ?
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah there's only in in this dimension . Like this . So curvy or not . Yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Exactly . Exactly .
A :  Also .
A :  Yeah that would be an option . I don't know what you think .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I think the I mean our aim is to make something different right ? To make something new . I would go for the double curved . And I I'm I'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . So it kind of holds nicely , something like that . Well this is really your decision but
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah I'd agree .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . If you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . As well . You can make a trigger button or something like that .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Something to shoot at your television
C :  Yeah or that that is the confirmation button or something , that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm . That would be a nice way to use it but I mean , yeah , I'm thinking big already , and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand I think .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah .
B :  That's yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Different .
A :  Stands out .
A :  Or
A :  Oh yeah a one hand uh solution .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So from top view it looks kinda like this . But from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . Maybe because the the screen is on top you can have
A :  can turn it maybe . To switch from buttons to interface hmm . If you turn it a little .
A :  .
D :  Maybe you can c have this kind of shape . A little upwards . So that the screen is more
C :  .
A :  Oh yeah . Least you can easily see it .
D :  towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen . Well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . So then you have double double curved in some way . So this this is so the screen is positioned over here .
C :  How about
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Oh . Something like that . And the buttons are more , well it's very thick now but
C :  Yeah I understand what you mean .
D :  That's uh that's
C :  How about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop . So that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . And then if you want
A :  If you can uh flip .
D :  Yeah ? That that you can press it and then it comes up ? Or
C :  Yeah . Something like that .
A :  Uh so you have a the the side view .
D :  But then the side view can be straight . If you have a pop-up screen . But I dunno if that's too expensive . I mean maybe it's too much
A :  So and you want to be able to
C :  Yeah .
A :  make this
C :  No uh like I would draw it like this .
A :  .
C :  Let's say this is the side view . That you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . If you know what I mean . So that it would come up like that .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  Okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way .
C :  Yeah or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Oh the advanced buttons . Right .
A :  Oh yeah . Yeah yeah yeah yeah . Right . Yeah that's good idea .
B :  That's the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But you you want okay . You just want to hide them all ? The oh .
C :  F for the L_C_D_ menu right ? So w w
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  No not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . But you can hide the okay and the back uh button . And the menu button also because when you flip it open and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically .
B :  Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Oh
C :  Activate and th the yeah .
D :  So okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open .
A :  Why ? You could just make it mechanical .
C :  True . True . But you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here . You know a simple uh with a
D :  Yeah . Yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your
B :  That's but it's it's not
C :  Yeah . Exactly .
B :  it's not very uh very strong uh yeah if you drop it one time .
D :  True . It uh c it can go open .
C :  Well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the L_C_D_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever .
A :  If you cover it with rubber .
D :  An adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm .
C :  And
A :  Yeah . So it can bounce .
C :  Exactly . Exactly . We just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . Th it's very solid yeah .
D :  Yeah , uh
D :  It's very no it's very strong . Yeah .
A :  Yeah okay so that that may work .
C :  That actually will offer some extra protection for the
A :  Okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape .
C :  Yeah . Yeah I was thinking , if if you have your hand , it this is your th
A :  Yeah . What kind of
A :  Harder .
D :  Yeah the lower part doesn't work I guess , so maybe you should try it over there .
A :  .
C :  Okay . If this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that .
C :  With your uh wrist . That you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . So it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f
B :  But when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh yeah . Yeah of course . Yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this . Like like you drew here .
A :  Maybe can design two versions .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But that's that's very expensive uh
D :  Yeah .
C :  And maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre . Give it I would give it a female shape but uh yeah . Anyway .
A :  Mm-hmm . And ergonomical shape . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  The female shape yeah . With two uh
D :  Yeah .
C :  Obviously . Make it more appealing to guys .
B :  We we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse , with which you can change uh and so if you
C :  I mean
A :  Oh yeah . Some uh k esk uh yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but but that's optional for later I guess . I mean , we have to make
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape .
B :  Some yeah .
D :  Yeah we we better so choose one
A :  Yeah yeah .
C :  And also the screen , you cannot mould it . You know kind of thing .
B :  No no no no .
D :  Yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . But that's the kind of the idea , so it lays good in the hand , and then on on the side with with your thumb , you you can you can use , yeah , you can use the button option
B :  Okay .
C :  Yeah .
C :  And then you can
C :  You can place the screen here , which can come .
A :  Yeah . So the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ?
C :  And but then I w I would
D :  Spongey .
C :  I would do the arrows here , kind of thing .
D :  Spongey can be reached by means of
C :  Those buttons ? And the simple buttons here , so that
B :  .
D :  Yeah . And and the and the control thngs in the middle ? The the the arrows ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  I Uh y eah that's what I mean . The arrows over here , and here the s simple uh
B :  No the arrow's over here . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah and then numbers .
A :  Buttons .
D :  Yeah . Alright .
A :  Okay . I think that uh it's a nice design . It's cool .
D :  Uh pretty nice design . Yeah . Yeah it looks uh pretty fancy .
A :  Yeah .
C :  or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? I dunno .
D :  .
A :  Yeah that's
D :  Uh bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , so it's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours . I don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? Like some soft green or something ? Or and then
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah we could make
A :  Orange or something .
B :  Or blue ? Dark blue or
D :  Oh yeah yeah , dark blue and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that , with very uh bright tones I guess . So you have something like
C :  We should use
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm .
C :  Yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the LEDs on the on the remote control . If you we uh yeah . If you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , also for the for the more uh yeah for the people .
C :  Yeah . Yeah okay yeah .
D :  Mm . That doesn't really work . To draw , I guess .
A :  Huh cool . No it's
A :  .
D :  Oh . What's this ?
A :  Yeah it's text .
D :  Right .
A :  N no you have to exit .
D :  Hm .
A :  You could also make line with uh Yeah .
B :  So that's
D :  Yeah . Two hours further .
D :  thickness . Oh .
B :  So that's blue .
D :  Oh . Wh why not go for the twenty ?
A :  Mm .
D :  Yeah . That's what I call painting . So that's that's a dark blue basic colour I guess . It's pretty nice .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah and then on top of that .
D :  And then uh
D :  Oh
A :  Some yellow .
D :  Yeah with some some yellow banana
A :  Banana colour .
D :  Like .
C :  And how about some uh some flashing standby lights ? Like you have on the Samsung , well I don't like to call brands phones , the you know that 'cause I remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often .
D :  Yeah ?
C :  So it not not only in in the colours of the LEDs , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , or
D :  How do you mean ?
A :  Yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically .
C :  Um
D :  Some some
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Exactly .
A :  Well I think it's a bit too much but
B :  Maybe a
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah an orange . Well alright well this is more like purple I guess , but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  So uh yeah . That would be a nice uh nice device I guess .
B :  And which which colour should uh should I give the the display ? Uh
B :  Or
A :  Who ?
D :  I mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? Ah well I don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six five thousand uh colour , so yeah too expensive . So just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that . Green is too old-fashioned . But blue , blue's okay . J
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  And then you can use yellow or semething .
A :  Why not ?
A :  Aye .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
C :  As long as you loo use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . So that people with uh with
B :  Yeah maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ?
A :  Like this .
D :  White backlight , and dark .
B :  Dark uh letters , yeah .
D :  Yeah . Whatever which is visible . I know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions . I mean it's hard to tell uh I dunno .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  And also for people who are a bit colourblind .
A :  Colourblind yeah .
D :  Yeah . True .
A :  No so that's mostly red and green I believe .
D :  Which which uh colour should the buttons be ?
B :  That's adjustable .
A :  Woah .
D :  Why adjustable ?
A :  All all buttons ?
B :  Yeah ? Or not .
D :  No uh
A :  Okay .
B :  That's how we are going to make it uh more trendy .
B :  Or is it uh too expensive ?
D :  But maybe I mean they have to they have to have some colour right ? And if the background is very dark blue
A :  It's difficult .
A :  Blue .
A :  Maybe green .
C :  But don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? So th the total of the thing is very bright ? Like the pictures I showed you guys . Those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy .
A :  Yeah you can
D :  Yeah ?
A :  Mm-hmm flashy .
D :  So more like
A :  Mm bzz .
D :  Doesn't work very well . Uh . More like this colour .
C :  Yeah something like that , something that stands out more .
D :  And then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something . But then then again , which colour should the buttons be ?
B :  Mm .
C :  Yeah .
D :  The the press buttons . Should they be white or black or
A :  Red maybe .
B :  And it it looks quite cheap , that colour I think . It's it's not
D :  Uh
A :  Black .
C :  The green ?
A :  Why ?
D :  Yeah but it's pretty fresh , on the other side .
B :  Yeah . I dunno .
A :  Yeah . So
C :  It's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment .
B :  It's it's trendy okay . But
D :  Yeah .
D :  My couch is in that colour .
B :  Mm .
A :  Ooh . .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Well it works pretty well .
B :  Yeah .
D :  And then time was up .
A :  Uh not yet .
D :  Uh
D :  .
C :  Do you get a pop-up if we
A :  Yeah within five minutes yeah .
D :  That you have five minutes left or
C :  Alright .
A :  Y left yeah left and then uh I have to kick you out .
D :  So something like this . That should be pretty nice colour . But maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . Because the of the green .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah yeah .
C :  No that's actu
B :  But the but the buttons have their own LEDs or not ?
A :  They have LEDs but they have a colour .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . Even for colourblind . They will see one of each as grey . But if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same .
D :  Yeah ?
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
C :  I think .
D :  So red buttons are okay ?
C :  I think so .
B :  Okay . That that's a default uh setting . The the red buttons .
A :  You can make them red .
A :  Yeah . But I think you need to keep in mind that the LEDs are just extra light .
D :  How do you mean ? Yeah .
A :  Uh they they don't determine the colour that much , I think .
B :  Okay . Yeah I I was think about a red uh red LEDs and blue LEDs and
D :  No that's that's too busy I guess .
A :  'Cause you have to print on them you have a background . Each number is transparent .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Uh partly but you have to print on the number . Or the the sign . So you can't
B :  Okay .
D :  You better bet better better keep the LED and the button itself in the same colour I guess . So just an extra
A :  change the colour so
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Bit of light .
C :  You can what we should do I think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured LED behind it . So that the whole button will shine
D :  bit of light and attention .
A :  Bit of feedback .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  as the colour the
C :  And if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay with
A :  Uh
A :  Don't mean to discourage you but uh basically
A :  you two are going to work on the smartboard . Next thirty minutes to design something so
C :  Ah , right .
D :  Alright .
A :  And the
A :  You will do the evaluation .
D :  Of the product ? Which we don't have yet .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah uh about
D :  So wh how should I do that ?
A :  Yeah I don't know . You probably get a mail .
D :  Oh okay . Or you you or you send it to me . Or just because you are going to design it on this board right ?
A :  Yeah . Once they are finished . Yeah .
A :  Yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . I don't know .
D :  Yeah . I I probably get instruction on that , how to do that , so I make another presentation I guess . I kn I know what's gonna happen in in yeah so
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  About . Yeah . You have the basic idea .
D :  I've a basic idea .
A :  And you two uh are going to do this .
C :  So we're gonna work here ? On this sketchboard ? Alright . Thanks .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Look-and-feel and
A :  Yeah . Good luck . So I uh make new page and uh be creative .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Alright so that's uh
D :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
B :  But we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ?
A :  Yeah you have uh thirty minutes .
C :  Thirty minutes .
B :  Okay .
A :  Then we have to uh see something which we can uh
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ?
C :  Alright .
A :  show to the management .
C :  Yeah . Shall we uh make a new uh
A :  I would yeah .
B :  Yeah l let's just uh delete all these uh or
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Next .
D :  .
C :  Yeah , I just make a new one . Alright .
B :  Oh , next .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Oh and save this uh board .
C :  Huh ? Yeah I'll just I'll just keep it there .
A :  Just save it .
A :  Yeah okay but just press save and uh
C :  Yeah .
A :  It'll be fine .
D :  On the left .
D :  S so , yeah .
C :  Uh sorry .
A :  You can also include clip-art .
C :  Okay . Current colour ? So um
D :  Yeah .
A :  So if you'll rather draw in paint or something
B :  Okay . Uh
C :  Shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ? Because I I
B :  Yeah .
B :  And then after that we can make the user uh inter interface .
A :  then look . Yeah .
C :  Yeah 'cause I have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . So how it's gonna look . And you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . So if I'm drawing and you think okay I'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . Uh do you mind if I draw in black then ? For normal sketches .
D :  This ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Uh pretty accurate .
D :  Oh we skip this I guess . Sound button press .
B :  Yep .
A :  Yeah . You can also include it . It's not much work .
D :  Light only button user ca user interaction .
B :  Oh no it's it's okay .
C :  so we kind of want the girlish
D :  Yeah .
A :  That's included . Yeah okay .
D :  Yeah . So the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction . So
C :  figure .
C :  I'm not so good at drawing .
C :  Excuse me ?
D :  Well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable .
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
C :  No uh uh .
D :  Maybe you should draw it very large like this .
B :  Yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Sensitive .
D :  Oh right .
C :  How do we uh uh or insert text ?
D :  Erase ?
A :  I dunno . Maybe just start typing .
B :  It's a bit uh large .
C :  Oh that's a bit big . Yeah .
A :  You also do the other sides . Not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view .
C :  Yeah . Ex exactly .
B :  .
B :  L let's make first the the the all the views . The the front view , side view and the back view .
C :  Uh
A :  Uh .
C :  Uh I thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and
A :  Jesus . What do I write down ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  Why can't I work here ? This is much easier . Yeah .
D :  Much easier , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  The middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand .
A :  Mm .
D :  I don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but
C :  Exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that I think .
A :  No so I just work here a few minutes .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah the display , we yeah we can put a display .
C :  Uh don't you think ? So the display we will put in here , the basic uh functions in here , where it's most reachable . The
B :  Yeah .
B :  The the arrow functions . Yeah . Yeah .
C :  The th
C :  Exactly .
C :  Oh . This is hard . What do don't have to draw it exactly do we ?
B :  No it's it's uh it's okay .
C :  Wait . Let me try it one more time .
C :  Maybe I've uh it's easier if I draw it in once .
C :  Okay , of course it will become way more ugly .
B :  You can make it m larger . Maybe it's easier to to draw uh
C :  Yeah .
C :  This'll take forever .
C :  It's fun to work with this pen . Um so , larger .
D :  Oh . Wrong one .
B :  Yeah that's that's the basic idea . Yeah .
C :  And yeah . So side .
A :  Five minutes left before the meeting ends .
C :  'Kay . Um other views ?
D :  Alright .
B :  Yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit .
C :  Uh
C :  Yeah .
B :  That's the question .
D :  But we we
C :  Let's fill i fill in the buttons later . So this is gonna be from the
B :  Yeah .
D :  I is it if if this is from the side woah . Steady . Because there the screen goes up like that right ? So then it's like this , or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the it's better to have it somewhat like this . Or does it flip all the way ?
C :  uh from yeah yeah . Sorry .
B :  From the
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah ?
C :  The the idea is that it has to flip up to here .
B :  Yeah I'm I'm
B :  May maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the L_C_D_ screen just into this this bubble .
C :  Okay .
B :  Because it do doesn't have to flip then .
B :  Because we have en enough space for for making a an L_C_D . Because here
C :  Yeah . Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  It's better to to have this like this I guess , and then flip it like this .
C :  True .
B :  But why why do we need uh the flipping uh
C :  you can adjust the angle to which it flips . So it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there . You can flip it up to there if you want .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . So w yeah . But we still keep the flipping mechanism .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Think so .
A :  Yeah we keep the flip ?
C :  Yeah because I think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that I dunno .
A :  Keep the flip live .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh the the shape is okay but yeah ?
B :  I don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism . Because we
C :  I thought it would be cool .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay yeah . It's it's for for for more trendy uh
D :  Yeah but maybe Yeah but maybe we we should then
B :  Because we have enough space . H here we got uh the basic functions , the the arrow uh yeah button .
D :  Yeah there the middle
D :  Sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? And then like i oh th doh .
B :  Yeah and then h we sh mm .
D :  Come on . So this is the shape . Oh . It hasn't
C :  . It doesn't aim so well .
D :  Okay but the screen is a bit lower because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . So there's a layer of rubber on the side . So no flipping but just no .
B :  Yeah , then it's
C :  Yeah yeah yeah . Definitely .
B :  No flipping or you wanted the flipping so
A :  No flipping ?
C :  Yeah I guess but uh I mean most votes count right ?
B :  But if you if you
B :  If you drop it it it just breaks . And it has to be very strong because of the . Yeah kind of
D :  Throwing and the kinetics . Oh . We better make we better make it like this . Eventually .
A :  It's shaking .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah true true .
C :  Yeah . Yeah if you if you're going for the kinetics
A :  Yeah just light on top .
B :  And it's also for the for the children , it's yeah for people not sixteen years . But there are more
D :  Yeah .
A :  Safer .
A :  Mm . Yeah okay that the target group .
D :  Uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . Yes .
B :  Yeah okay . That's true .
B :  Okay . Yeah ?
A :  Well . I just uh ended the meeting . You two go design .
C :  Yeah . I'm just thinking totally different designs also . Remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a Gameboy . Maybe we should try something like that . But yeah .
B :  Okay wi
A :  Oh . By the way . Um
B :  Yeah .
A :  I uh thought up a name for our product . Yeah . It's called uh the Real Remote .
D :  Yeah ?
C :  Oh right .
D :  Ooh .
A :  With a copyright sign after Real .
C :  Alright .
D :  Yeah . Alright .
B :  The Real Remote .
C :  Yeah . I like it . Okay . This can go .
D :  Good .
A :  So maybe you can include that somewhere .
D :  Yeah . We should work in our own room right ? Or not ?
C :  Oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well .
A :  Yeah .
A :  I don't see any power cables here so
C :  Let's see .
D :  Yeah . Yes .
C :  What the hell's that ?
A :  'Kay .
B :  I think uh it's the sensors . Okay .
D :  See you two in half an hour uh
C :  Uh
A :  Good luck .
B :  Yep .
B :  Okay that's the side .
B :  Ah it's it's okay . But do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons ?
C :  Yeah . I think we do .
B :  Or just leave it ? Uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll , volume button .
C :  Yeah or j or also scrolling for the m yeah . Yeah ?
B :  For menu . Or
C :  I dunno . We w kind of wanted to stick with the
B :  Yeah . No , yeah .
C :  Yeah I'm just thinking , if we i we wanna make something different right ? So the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons .
B :  Yeah .
C :  I think .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah you are going to design it so
A :  Hello again .
C :  Hi .
B :  Hello .
D :  Hey , Project Manager .
B :  Um , Project Manager , I have something to tell you . I have a little problems with my laptop . And uh s s s so I had a little less time to complete .
A :  Mm yeah .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
B :  No , a little problem , uh big problem . I just thought Um , it didn't work anymore .
D :  What was it , problem ?
D :  The laptop ?
B :  The entire Windows uh
D :  It hang hung .
B :  It it hung .
D :  Ha-ha .
D :  Oh .
D :  Project Manager .
A :  Yes .
D :  You're our Project Manager .
A :  Yes .
A :  Your project manager .
A :  Welcome to the conceptual design meeting
C : 
A :  for Real Reaction .
A :  Uh , hello again . Uh it's uh the same as the last time . Uh uh , also this time there will be uh three presentations . And we um must uh reach a decision on uh the remote control concepts . Um uh , and at the end , uh I uh , when I finish it off I have some uh input from uh a master class I uh visited . information .
B :  During lunch , yeah .
D :  Master .
B :  He's the master , yeah .
D :  Master of
A :  The the the the the concepts on uh we uh where we uh must reach a decision on . Um uh , our from uh are of two sorts . Components concepts and user interface concepts . Uh , the first one is uh really about the the the the the total package uh with uh Well , we have decided to do a do the uh with a touch-screen that must be a case around it so uh it won't be uh uh as breakable . Uh how how about the energy ? Can you uh can you reload it or uh just have batteries which you must exchange ? Uh , the user interface concept . Uh , with the type and uh the the supplements . So uh where to put what button .
A :  And uh uh I would say uh Jans , can you begin ? Okay . At the end , uh I will take notes uh and at the end of the minutes uh will uh be at the shared folder .
C :  Yeah , sure .
C :  Okay .
C :  Uh , let me see . I think it's this one .
C :  Ha .
B :  Wow .
C :  Right . Uh , well , I'll be talking about the components .
C :  Uh , what I did was I reviewed previously used items uh by uh two two uh different uh age groups . Uh below forty five and above . And uh I just uh watch what the differences are and I checked uh , well , what what d do we want , and how can we uh d aim a at uh the target group . Well uh what I found was that a senior um
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  I'm sorry . Okay . Go on .
C :  senior citizens uh
C :  Ye Ah , it's it's okay . Uh They , well , they like more the they like the traditional materials , like wood and and such more . Wood and chrome . And uh uh they like uh straightforward shapes . Um , uh they they they they like luxurious uh styles , where whereas the young and dynamic , they like a more uh soft materials .
C :  Think of the Teletubbies , for instance . Uh uh , soft and fluffy and colourful and Well uh , shapes are curved and round . Y y you get the picture . And uh they like sports and gaming , and that gives them uh the vitality . Uh , so w well uh , firs Yes .
A :  One one little question . Um about the the material . Uh a soft material for a remote control ?
C :  Yeah .
C :  No , I'll I'll get to that . You you'll see . Yeah .
A :  Okay . Yeah . Thank you .
C :  Uh , well f first off , let's start start with the energy . W I uh I had a choice between uh a few different uh sources . But uh the two basic sources that I found were the best possible were the battery uh versus kinetic . Uh kinetic , that's when you move something , then uh it gets energy .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I figured , well that's ki kinda high-tech , when when you have a remote control that well , when you pick it up , it has power . That would be actually very nice , uh I figured . Well , we could also use a battery , that's a bit
A :  Oh .
D :  Yeah but when the power gets low , you have to shake it or something ?
C :  Yeah . Yeah yeah , you c just you have to shake it around a little bit . And then then it d then it has some more uh energy . Well , y you could just go for a battery . Or you can go for both ?
D :  Uh , and uh uh
D :  Hmm .
B :  Oh , have you considered the option of using a solar panel ?
C :  Yeah , I actually did . But uh the thing is about solar panel is you have to have l uh light . Well , sunlight preferably . Uh , and you you could you could use normal light , but uh you wouldn't get the same amount of energy that you would from a battery or something .
B :  W nah .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Uh for uh ultimate b uh n uh use of uh solar panels , you could actually use uh you could use uh solar panels , but uh you ha you'd have to implement them into uh the remote control , leaving you uh a bit less space for the interface .
D :  Mm yeah . It's too less space .
B :  Yeah .
C :  So uh so i i it it wo what's actually I I c just in f I've figured it out that well , uh seeing that you'll always be uh within the l uh distance of T_V_ , and the from T_V_ there comes a a a whole bunch of light .
C :  So it would actually power itself uh from a T_V_ . But , well you just take up all the space , and you wouldn't uh have the full amount of power actually used . So I I prefer kinetic because it's uh well , the costs aren't that much higher , and um , ju just a bit more high-tech than than a normal battery . I mean , if
B :  Yeah .
B :  Okay .
A :  But you prefer kinetic ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , but you don't move a a remote control too much .
C :  No , but uh d Well , you pick it up and you press buttons and y well , you
A :  And that's enough to to keep the energy level uh
C :  Yeah , well uh actually it is . And it it if it isn't , you just shake it a bit and and add add with power up again . But , what l what Jarek said , you could you could use a battery that you'd just keep it on the recharging whenever it moves . And for rest , you'd just add juice on the battery .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  And when the battery doesn't work , I usually shake it too . So Like slamming on it . It's exactly the same .
C :  Exactly .
A :  Thank you , Tim .
C :  And so that Uh Uh well , f furthermore , you you we uh checked uh the cases . We have uh different options uh concerning the cases . You ha I you sim uh you simply add a basic uh standard uh model uh it was kind of square and uh I figured that's a bit boring .
C :  So you you we could go for uh the single curved or the double curved . Um , single curve , it's just a well , uh , you know , it's just uh a nice curve . Or but but you could go in a in an double curves . And that's like several different dimensions . That gives you an whole new uh effec
A :  Yeah .
A :  Dynamic dynamic look ?
D :  Hmm .
C :  Yeah , that gives you a younger and uh more high-tech look , I f I figured . But , that uh we'll discuss later .
D :  But , are you going to draw it ?
C :  What ?
D :  The Yeah .
C :  You want me to draw in three-D_ ? Uh , yeah , I ca I ca I could I could show you . I could show you . Well uh let's say y uh you uh
B :  Th th yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Uh , I c I can't imagine .
D :  I can't imagine how how how it looks like .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Let's say that's your standard uh
D :  Design .
B :  Yeah .
C :  That's a bit your d standard design . But you could actually go like uh something like this .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  And then uh in three-D_ effect you could go
B :  Um
D :  Uh
C :  So y you you just
A : 
C :  Yeah , this is a this bit uh difficulty in I didn't take a major in art . So But but you could have uh uh a whole new uh the back back the the the depth , you could you could uh just play around a bit with . You you don't have to use standard uh
D :  Oh , okay .
D :  Okay .
D :  Oh , okay .
A :  A little artistic .
C :  Yeah you could y It leaves more space for creativity . Uh that might be an idea , but just a Well , furthermore , uh well , uh plastic versus rubber ? You We could choose uh what uh what's better , plastic um or rubber . I I ch prefer rubber because it feels uh Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  It's soft .
C :  Yeah , it's soft and it's that I like soft . Yeah , yeah I mean uh plastic uh is Plastic also has that cheap feeling to it , like plastic uh Your your I usually associate plastic with uh something that's cheap . Uh that's maybe just me , but Uh , we could uh
A :  That's the material the younger people want uh , ain't it ?
C :  uh , oh , talk about it later . Uh furthermore , buttons . Uh traditional uh or a touch screen . Well , we discussed it in a previous meeting , so I figured I'll just leave it at the L_C_D_ .
C :  And uh chip set , well uh if we are going to use traditional buttons , we could go uh with a simple chip set . But uh if we decide to go on a n uh um L_C_D_ screen , we would use an uh we have to use an a advanced chip set . And that would bring uh the necessary costs with with it .
C :  So that's something we th have to keep in mind . If it isn't uh manageable uh budget-wise , we'd have to go over to uh to sim to simple buttons .
D :  Well , I think uh we're going to sell tell ten millions of them .
D :  So uh I bet a big company in uh Korea or Taiwan , like uh Samsung , can give us uh a big discount on the chips , so
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , probably .
D :  U usually , chips are uh aren't more expensive than one dollar .
C :  Yeah , probably , but But uh yeah , that's that's That shouldn't shouldn't be uh that big a issue . I'll I'll I'll just add , uh uh I put a big summary here , so we could discuss it a bit . Uh what i what are your ideas concerning battery versus kinetic ?
D :  So
D :  That that shouldn't be a real issue , I think .
B :  Um , I think you should use kinetic as a back-up .
C :  Yeah , you you you should we should A combination . Uh , you use the battery and w charge it up with kinetic . When you pick it up , it charges up .
D :  Yeah , a combination .
B :  A combination , yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Like an uh aku uh
C :  Yeah .
D :  Acu uh , yeah . Well , . Yeah .
C :  Yeah yeah , I know .
B :  Okay . Yeah .
A :  Just like the watch from Seiko .
B :  Psycho-kinetic . Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I con Exactly . What uh what do you think ? You agree ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  I I uh I would prefer uh both uh too .
C :  Yeah ? Both ?
D :  Combine them .
A :  Yeah . Combine them .
C :  Okay . Uh , well that would bring the m m some more costs , but I mean the
D :  Okay .
C :  Who cares , right . That's the Project Manager's problem .
B :  Buy a fifty cents battery and uh
D :  Of course . Fifty cent .
A : 
C :  Yeah , well Fifty cent uh Uh , why doesn't And then we have single-curved versus double-curved . That
B :  Well maybe I have something in my presentation to uh to cope with that .
C :  Okay . No , we'll we'll just wait and uh Uh , plastic versus rubber . Any ideas ? Uh , rubber ? You
D :  Rubber .
A :  Rubber . Yeah .
B :  Um , isn't possible to make combination with kind of rubber is or bendable remotes where you've got a . Or do you think it Rubber casing , yeah .
C :  Uh , I figured it will be m rather than hard Nah , rubber c uh this is a casing , yeah . Rubber casing , because well if you use an uh d a touch-screen , uh it's just a casing uh around it . So um , you could go for plastic , but I figured
D :  Rather hard .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um , well d Maybe I can ask it right now the question that I have . Uh , is it possible uh of is it necessary to make a touch-screen square ? It isn't , I think , yeah ?
C :  I I I would choose rubber .
C :  Well , m I don't know . No .
D :  Well , I think that touch-screens are generally square . But it's the case you put around it that makes the shape . Hmm ?
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah .
B :  We're We put fashion in electronics , so maybe we can uh
C :  That isn't
D :  Yeah okay , but if you have a square uh L_C_D_ screen , and you put a case around it that has uh like bulbs or that that covers part of the L_C_D_ screen . That
B :  Mm yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah , that would cover it . That that would solve the problem .
D :  That's it's custom customisable and
B :  Oh , yeah . Okay , I I get it .
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  So mm Uh uh so uh so what are the opinions ? Uh rubber or plastic ? I I I prefer rubber . Yeah , you too ? You sure ? You you you seemed to hesitate a bit .
D :  Yeah , me too .
A :  Me too . Yeah ?
B :  Okay .
B :  That's good . Well , as long a as long as it's it's uh it's firm , and you don't uh it's not bendable or something , I th I think that goes too far .
D :  Mm yeah .
C :  Yeah , it it shouldn't it shouldn't flop over when you hold it in your hand uh No , that that that that's gonna The the chip set will hold it firm in place , and uh and and uh and a L_C_D_ screen also
A :  Okay .
B :  Oh .
D : 
B :  Okay .
B :  It might even bounce back when you drop it on the floor . Okay .
C :  Yeah it m might it might . Uh , tra uh traditional versus L_C_D_ , well I figured we we all set on that . And uh , then also the simple versus advanced . Well I figure if we go for L_ L_C_D_ , we we should have the advanced . So that shouldn't be a problem . Okay , well that's my uh
A :  Mm yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Thank you .
C :  Uh , you're welcome .
D :  Can I uh do my thing ? It uh
A :  Yeah . Do your thing , Tim .
B :  Do your thing .
C : 
A :  Bring it on .
D :  Expert map .
D :  Okay uh
D :  Last week
D :  I went to uh Paris and Milan for some trend-watching .
D :  For marketing .
D :  Our research and development department and I went to Paris and Milan . In Paris and Milan , we uh asked different people , uh differing in age and in income , uh the amount of money to spend , um what they like in design uh and material nowadays .
D :  Findings . Our main audience , uh so that's people below forty , uh prefer the following . At first , the colours of fruit .
D :  Very basic colours , like Janus explained . Um , fresh colours , uh green , red , uh strawberry red , uh yellow , banana yellow . Um , considering material , um
D :  Yeah . They like spongy material , like yeah a sponge-ball . Like a s soft material . Janus m uh mentioned it also . I think he did some uh
B :  Spongeball .
A :  Yeah .
D :  some findings himself . You wer you weren't in Paris ? Okay . Like this .
C :  Well , the Teletubbies sh
D :  Like big uh g flashy colours . Fresh . It's nice , I think .
A :  Flashy .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Okay , our secondary audience , uh people above forty a forty years in age , they like the dark traditional colours . Uh
D :  Yeah , uh materials like wood that
A :  Yeah , but wood is not a not a material you which you build a a remote control of .
C :  Well , you could . You you could . Well uh
D :  No n j just j just a w
A :  Yeah but never seen one .
B :  It'll float .
D :  No , okay , but just just a wooden uh look .
A :  Case . Oh , a wooden look , yeah .
C :  Yeah .
D :  Like uh you have those fake uh fake panels on the floor . The that isn't wood anyway , but Okay ?
B :  Tables .
A :  Okay .
D :  But , that's our secondary audience . So , uh we decided to take
A :  Yeah .
D :  mm yeah the people below forty . So , that this doesn't apply .
A :  Yeah .
D :  'Kay , the third . Uh , there're some overall thoughts about new remote controls . They have to look fancy .
D :  Um , they should be technological in innovative .
D :  That means uh there have to be fancy things in . Uh , and easy to use . But that's common .
D :  My personal preferences .
D :  We have to aim at a mu at the main audience . And uh , therefore use fresh colours .
A :  Would you prefer uh uh that you can choose the colour of your uh remote control or
D :  Uh , I'll I'll come to that in a second point . Here , think about removable covers , as seen in mobile telephon telephone market . To customise your own remote control . Like the Nokia uh the removable covers , uh just put a red on it and go to the shop and buy a green one .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh , a third , material being used uh could well be stuff like rubber . Um , two advantages . Uh , it fits within the current market trends . And uh it adds safety to your remote uh when you drop it . So
D :  Uh to come back to your question , I think uh and the people in Milan and Paris also think that uh the rubber should be pretty hard . Like uh
D :  seen on regular mobile phones .
D :  Actually , they have a lot in common . The phones and the
C :  Well , I actually saw a phone that you could use as a remote , so Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah . Okay .
B :  Ah .
A :  Maybe you could use your remote as a phone .
B :  Hey .
C :  Hey . That might be a next step .
A :  There are numbers on it , so uh
D :  Yeah , exactly . Uh , in my second sheet of personal preferences , uh we have to reconsider the speech function uh recognition . Uh , it's very innovative . Innovative .
A :  So that you say um S_P_S_S_ , and it goes to uh Okay .
D :  Yeah , like something . You you can see that the market is just screaming for new technologies , like speak uh speech recognition and stuff . But , we have to keep the cost in uh in mind , but it
B :  Twelve fifty uh
D :  Yeah , it it can be uh very expensive . 'Kay , second . Uh , building games like Snake or Tetris to amuse the younger users . Uh , also the link with uh mobile phones . Uh
A :  Yeah , but you don't use that th games when you watching television , I think .
D :  No , but No , okay . But you don't use games when you're d when you're making a telephone call . It's just the same .
C :  Well , yeah .
B :  When your parents are watching some boring program , you can take the remote and do something else .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay .
D :  When you're at college . Uh No . You al you also take uh t you take your IPac and go uh play games . Yeah . Yeah . Well , I do that , but Okay , and um
B :  Take it .
C :  You take your uh remote with you to school .
A :  You take your remote control with you .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And third , I stick with it , the log-in functionality uh with the slogan , take parental control to a new dimension .
C :  Very nice .
B :  Ooh . S
D :  That's it .
A :  Uh great .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  In
B :  Okay . Um the interface contents .
B :  Well that's a just simple PowerPoint mock-up I want to m make it more as dynamic for you so I'll draw there . But , the main concept is um take one big touch screen .
B :  Um , always display the primary buttons clear and visible .
B :  Maybe even li like this with uh u uses of a lot of space . And uh make the menu structure changeable . So if you press um system , that's Yeah , well m multiple system options can , maybe five or ten or or one , can fit in . Or maybe even a step further when you want to um
B :  t um have some other options that are not programmable with one horizontal button . And um other buttons can may be displayed here if that's necessary . And um well , how do uh do we want to look at uh uh f um Yeah Does a remote look Well , it's you've gotta hold it in one hand . So um the middle like all remotes have to be in a little bit small , so you can put it in
B :  inside your hands . And some remotes you can use with your thumb . But I think that's too difficult for this one . So you can make it s a little broader .
B :  Yeah . And here ? And maybe use your thumb
B :  on the on the main buttons . And use your other hands
B :  on the menu structure . So here are gonna be the program buttons . One , two , three , four , et cetera .
B :  And the the volume control and program control maybe .
B :  And , down here ,
B :  um , I added , this could be one uh big L_C_D_ . Um , the menu structure .
B :  So you can use it in uh in this way .
B :  Um
B :  One thing you've gotta keep in mind , keep the remote clear of too much functions at the same time . Um , know that if you are changing the menu structure here , um
B :  And well , I still believe you should keep displaying the buttons . But if you're programming the colour of the T_V_ , do not display twenty other options that are possible . Just keep it as simple as uh as possible . And do not use too many levels . Do not have to select a screen first and then brightness and then colour and un-plus , and um push plus twenty times . But just the um uh just in one button if possible .
B :  And um , well , you kn you all know the T_V_ levels . Um , channel one , two . And when you get to n to uh to ten , ye and want to go back , uh well you have a problem . Just m most most modern T_V_s , you you press one zero , and it goes to ten . And else , to one and through after that . So the s a button less . And um , things like teletext , put them in the menu . Things like um um
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Uh , what do you think about a back-and-forth come-up uh button ? L like in uh internet explorer .
B :  Yeah , yeah w Yeah , I I find I must trying to uh tell it . Is uh volume plus and minus ? And this is program uh plus
B :  and minus . Uh
D :  Yeah okay , but does it that is for uh going from four to five . But if you go from two to eight , and you want
B :  Yes .
B :  Or if you're watching Studio Sports on uh on seventeen , and your wife is watching some soap on two Well yes , I think that's a good idea . But um , well m my preference would to be put it in the menu structure . And if you're using that button a lot of times , well of course the menu will still be displayed on the screen . You just don't have to play games uh in-between . But if you're really switching between two channels , you won't have time uh to d use the other options .
D :  Yeah , and on two . That you can switch switch easy .
D :  Yeah it is .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm no .
B :  Um , yeah already already told that .
D :  That's it .
B :  Yeah . That's my conclusion .
D :  Okay .
A :  Oh , okay .
A :  Uh
A :  I think we can discuss a little about the the three uh kind of revolutionary things uh Tim uh came with . The parental control , the games , and the voice recognition . Uh
A :  There's n not uh too much decision on uh that one so uh I think that parental control is a good function to uh to put in the remote . I don't know how you think about it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Well , I agree , just put it in the menu structure somewhere .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um , yeah um system properties , um parental control .
D :  Yeah but
D :  What I see uh How I see it is you put it on the the remote and then you have like a Windows log-on screen with parents , children .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Mm .
D :  Something like that . And w when you want to use the parents uh option , you have to
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um , w well , yeah .
B :  It it has to be fast . You don't want to to go down and watch the news at eight o'clock and turn it on and wait twenty seconds for for uh the log-on screen and then remember your code and all kinds of settings .
D :  Yeah , ok
A :  No but I think most people uh find it uh much more important that their children don't watch uh sex or violence uh on the television , and uh wait uh ten or fifteen seconds longer , so they can uh finally watch it uh because of that . Uh
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Why
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  You c may use like when there's uh X_P_ , uh a simple log-on , d you just push uh one or two or three . And if you push parents , then Yeah . To log in .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Pu push parents . That then then then you have to uh go to three-digit uh log-in . Like two one three . And it's in .
B :  Yeah . And if you puts a ye
B :  Uh-huh . And if you w you push p children , uh you don't have to uh log in , but you can only watch uh children's channels or uh Okay . Well
A :  Yeah .
D :  It automatically goes Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
C :  I don't know if it's worth uh the time and effort we are going to spend on it . Because well it's a simple function , but it's gonna take a lot of resources and a lot of time um to programming it . Because you'll have to start working with the profiles and such . And I'm not sure if it's actually worth uh investing that much time and effort into it . I don't know what
D :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well I think that's a b there's a big market for it , because uh you Yeah , you read many times in magazines same kind of stuff , and you heard on the news that uh that he Yeah , they believe that children uh are influenced by the television , and uh Well , we're we're aiming uh to uh below uh forty uh years . But there are a lot of uh people will below forty who have uh children in young age uh who who want um to uh not watch uh violent or uh
D :  Mm yeah .
D :  V violent T_V_ .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well , maybe um some idea on that . Just make through a remote as it is , but make an option to insert profiles , 'cause if my grandad would buy this remote , he wouldn't want to bother with all all the all the uh things to do . Just make it an option in menu , ins install powerful profiles or something .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , of course .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  That's a that's a better idea ?
D :  Yeah , w It just has to be w when it's deliver out of the store , it has to be just simple and plain . But if you want to install it personally uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay .
D :  If I got kids , and I could choose between uh two remote controls . One uh w with parent control and one without , and I would would buy the one with .
A :  Yeah , with and one without .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um , b well , still some question I have about how to incorporate those ones . You're thinking about some channels they uh cannot see , but well , I I when I think , oh yeah , for the f for all the standard channels , and only for maybe after ten o'clock uh in the evening violent films and movies uh will come and uh maybe maybe some some timing uh will be uh needed instead of uh of channels , because if you're watching uh , I don't know , you're in the at day uh , cartoons will come up m on maybe Friday night . I don't know .
D :  I th Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , maybe it can work with show view . Uh , you you can control your video recorder with show view . Uh , when you tick in a number , it will uh start and end uh recording . But maybe there's some option that uh that t uh the kind of show view numbers are violent , and that they are blocked out .
B :  Yeah , the disadvantage vantage is that someone will has to send all the show-view numbers of the programs that they remotes and edit it all , will have to decide uh
A :  Yeah . That's true .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but yeah but that isn't possible .
B :  That isn't possible .
A :  Yeah .
C :  But , well , if you want to I i i if we in incorporate uh the parental control , uh let's say we do , and and well whatever , cho uh child just goes up to the T_V_ and presses up for instance . Well uh , nob nobody's stopping the child from uh well checking uh the channel .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Well , yeah you could say if parental control is only it it'll go from fourteen to sixteen with the page-up then , but
C :  But that
C :  Well , I'm not sure because um for that to happen , you d you will have to receive a signal from the uh remote control , so it would , yeah , have to be constant uh constant signalling .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm-hmm .
C :  What m what may be better is to incorporate an uh a separate device that uh that you can program with the remote control . And that uh provides parental control , for instance . And that's just an optional uh device . So there's n that's there's uh besides uh the remote control , you'll have a separate uh
A :  I wouldn't put it in an optional device . That that then then then it becomes too much , I think .
C :  Yeah ?
A :  If we do it , we we must do it in a kind of ways that like a profile , a parent profile , and a family profile , and otherwise .
D :  Yeah , and
B :  Yeah , on a separate menu uh option .
D :  And and you know w uh when you install another device , uh children can still go up to the T_V_ , p pop open uh the thing and and and g
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , that's true . That's true , but uh at same instant , same happens when uh you have remote control . So
D :  go to a channel .
D :  Yeah , yeah of course . But
C :  But , only difference is uh the uh the people buying the remote control will now get the f added feature of parental control , and those people wouldn't uh necessary want it . So , you you'd be
D :  Yeah .
D :  Ah it's Yeah . Yeah , okay . But it's just an an added feature feature .
A :  Yeah . Okay . And what do you uh guys think of the games in the voice recognition ? I personally think that that becomes too much .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , well yeah , I
A :  It's more like it gets you to the functionality , but
B :  A mail too from management that it's very popular to use voice recon recognition . But I don't think when you're watching T_V_ uh , hearing loud noises from the T_V_ , someone screaming one , and you f the channel switches , uh Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , like f voice recognition is too much , I think . But games . It doesn't
B :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . And games ?
C :  Yeah . I can see games happening . Yeah .
B :  W you can put it on chip anyway , so uh
D :  Yeah .
D :  That that doesn't c that doesn't co
B :  As long as it's isn't a primary feature of the remote , but uh
A :  That would
D :  Yeah , that that doesn't cost a lot of extra resources , I think .
A :  Okay . So that will uh that that that must be in it , you think ?
C :  Yeah , that will be nice .
A :  Okay . So the games uh are in it . The voice recognition are not . And the parental control are
B :  Optional in
A :  optional ?
D :  Yeah , it's it's in it . But too ma I I think so , but
B :  But how we do it ?
A :  Yeah .
B :  Well , I think also it's a good idea , buts very difficult to incorporate . So we should make it too complex . Is t some menu uh function , you choose parental control , and maybe four files will emerge from menu where put it on . But uh how how it's gonna work uh uh will f be a problem .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay . Uh , but uh will there uh uh Like the first idea uh from uh You can buy it without and uh with parental contr control ? Or are we going to put it in and uh just uh
B :  Mm-hmm . Well
B :  Ye I I think best would be uh to put it in and make it an menu option . You can put on Yeah . And you can just uh s when you buy it , you can select um personal preference , parental control on , and the password or something .
D :  To put Yeah , to put it in always .
A :  Yeah ?
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Well , I don't know . I I figure if you had two different remotes , you could bo choose one with uh well uh uh a receiver in it . So you could actually easily uh build in uh parental control . But it would would be uh more expensive . So , a and that that way uh you could make cheap model and a expensive model . Could ma make the uh simple model and the deluxe model , uh for instance .
B :  Oh , it's a p Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but T_V_s aren't capable of sending .
C :  Yes they are . Yeah .
D :  Yeah ?
D :  I thought they were just
A :  Yeah , you yo Yeah , but most often not .
C :  Yeah , you you have some T_V_s any
D :  a able to receive . Yeah , some . But
C :  Yeah . That is true , that is true .
B :  Well , maybe you just have to restrict it to what programs , where the parent says , you cannot watch channel seven , nine , and ten , and you cannot watch all channels after ten o'clock . And there's just some little uh clock in the remote .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Well yeah , you could you could easily you could easily you could easily to the mote control . But you still have the problem about uh the television itself .
D :  Yeah , j just some rules .
A :  Yeah .
B :  No , no , it's very simple . There uh th I h I've seen some of remotes who have a clock in it . So , the remote does doesn't transmit when it's after twelve clock . Yeah ?
C :  Yeah , yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah , okay . But , on the T_V_
D :  at least my T_V_ , is a is a compartment which you can press . And there are buttons uh behind it which you can use , if you d if you don't if you don't have a
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well , that's To put it very blunt , that's not our problem . Just have um the parents buy uh some glue and uh It's not not a part of the remote .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , of course .
C :  Yeah , that is true . Yeah , that is true . Yeah , you could you could you could go like uh that that would actually make uh things a lot more easy . You could just blame it on television and uh make it their problem .
B :  You have to f Yeah . Uh , or make it ourselves very diffic
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , I figured I figure we could do that . Yeah , yeah , sure .
B :  Okay .
D :  Or j Yeah .
C :  Uh , I'm not sure what marketing thinks about it , but
D :  Ah I have to uh consult my legal advisor about it .
A :  Okay . So uh I think we have decided on the things that Uh from Janus , the energy , the combination between battery and kinetic . The case will be double-curved and uh rubber , in a fr flashy fruity colour uh that with cover is removable . The buttons will be uh touch-screen . Uh but there may not be too many buttons . And in the the menu structure , uh there must not to be uh
A :  Five minutes to go . Uh , too uh too many levels . And uh it must be easy to use . The parental control will be incorporated , but it must be not too complex . And the games are in it . So
B :  Okay .
A :  I think we have uh we have decided uh , okay .
D :  Consensus .
A :  Uh , little more .
D :  Oh . Oh . I I have one thing left . Maybe for uh Jerome . Um , the views .
B :  Oh .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah ? I'm listening .
D :  Maybe it's uh handy to build in an expert view and a simple view .
A :  Like a like a moat or s or something . Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Like at In the experts view , you have a lot of more buttons .
B :  Um , well
C :  User profile .
A :  Yeah , but you have that in the
B :  What I was thinking about is just a menu structure , when you don't use it is simple . And when you push uh system properties , uh entire list pops up with e ev all kind of f stuff you can program .
A :  Yeah . You use the
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . It's already incorporated a little in that concept .
D :  Mm yeah , okay . Fairly enough . Yeah .
C :  Well yeah , you you could actually build in a function that you can program it yourself , for the more advanced users .
D :  Yeah , wh which buttons you like or not .
C :  Yeah , which buttons do you want to in it . Because you can you can like build in a back-forward button , and uh some po somebody would just want to watch two channels .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah . Just leave the other numbers away .
A :  Okay .
C :  Yeah , you could you could m have people want uh want that .
A :  We take it to the other meeting , okay ? I have a little w uh little chat to do and uh then we uh finish . I went to uh a master class and uh uh two things uh are uh are uh can come in handy uh for us . First thing uh is uh we talked about knowledge uh management . Knowledge engineering and uh uh the fact that uh that uh that the idea of knowledge , uh sharing and learning knowledge from other companies is uh like that . It's it's uh very hot at the moment , so it's it's mostly for the management expert to to look what other uh marketing or did I said management ? Oh . Just talking about myself . Uh W
D :  Okay . Go on .
C :  Ah , yeah , sure .
D :  A little chat .
D :  Marketing .
D :  Management . Yeah , that's my function , to Okay . Go on .
A :  What other companies uh had to uh also with the the the the marketing campaign when they put on a newer remote , just some uh Yeah . Import export . And uh another one . Uh , they're a ha they're at Yeah , benchmarking , that's the word I saw .
B :  Som some bench-marker .
A :  I uh couldn't uh Okay , uh another uh thing is uh there were there there was a survey , and um uh it came out that um people like to buy things from a single large provider , instead of those who uh are partnering uh with us . So , we must uh we must bring it as if uh Real Reaction is uh is big company , uh a trustful company , and uh it has m
D :  How I know a marketing name for our product .
A :  Okay .
D :  R_ th R_ to the third power . R_ three . Real Reaction remote .
A :  I had a I had another idea to put uh uh the whole the whole idea of uh Real Reaction and uh uh uh a single brand and uh uh that kind of thing . When you uh put on remote , you see a kind of a just like when you telephone , you see a little uh animation . Real Reaction remote . And uh with the with the with the motto , we put fashion in electronics . And then you go uh
B :  Oh .
D :  Mm-hmm ?
B :  Uh , logo . Yeah ? Yeah .
D :  Bling .
D :  Yeah . Yeah , okay , but it has to be like a split second , because you have to put in a code also and
A :  The
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well , you can show somebody a logo for point five seconds , they'll still remember it . And it it l linger on every time you see it .
A : 
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . But w th the idea from this uh thing is that we must present it as a as we are a a single large provider who will stand on our own .
C :  Well , if you if you have the l L_C_D_ screen , you can you can uh have a small logo i uh at the bottom . And it could just stay there . Yeah , that spins around or something .
D :  Yeah .
D :  That spins around like all the time .
A :  Mm yep , yeah . Also also . But we we are uh
B :  Very annoying .
C :  Hmm .
D :  It it's just like a uh globe in Internet Explorer .
A :  Yeah yeah y yeah yeah . Okay , but uh think about that kind of things . That's what they said in the master class . . N Uh , next meeting starts in thirty minutes . So uh maybe you can go to Paris and Milan uh once again .
C :  Yeah . Yeah , something like that . A small icon .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I It's ok For f
D :  Okay .
B :  Oh , for the next meeting , right ?
D :  Who uh
D :  Who who gave you the master class ? Ronald Betenberg ?
A :  The master class ? Franz Mehler's .
D :  Okay , thanks .
A :  Uh , very special , uh next uh session . Uh idea that you uh the the industrial uh development uh centre and uh user interface uh will work together on a prototype . And uh will drawing it on the SMARTboard . So that's a kinda new uh thing . And um , the marketing expert will uh will uh ke he will be keeping busy with the product uh evaluation . But the most uh specific instructions will be sent to you by email .
D :  Ah .
B :  Um
C :  So we're going to work together right now ?
B :  Stay here and
A :  Yeah , the well , uh dids this what I uh what I heard . I
D :  In the master class .
A :  Not in the master class .
D :  Yeah .
A :  So you uh just wait for the specific instructions and uh But I think it was a very uh very good uh session , uh gentlemen .
B :  P_ .
B :  Ah , no new email .
C :  Definitely .
D :  Me too .
A :  I will thank you all .
B :  Okay .
C :  Well thank you too .
B :  Thank you . Thank you very much .
A :  And uh
D :  Thank you too , lord .
A :  Give me a good evaluation .
B :  Yeah .
D :  'Kay guys , lot of success .
B :  Uh-huh . See you .
C :  You wish . M Aye ? Cheers .
A :  Cheers . See you in a half hour .
C :  Hey .
A :  But keep an eye on your uh laptops for a real uh
C :  Yeah , uh I'm not sure if we uh we Because I saw something about individual actions .
A :  Yeah , but th there's there's still the my uh instructions that you will work together .
B :  Yeah . Here ? Or uh
A :  That's not my problem . Bye-bye .
B :  Yeah . If you got a No . So Stupid manager .
C :  Well , yeah . Right . Uh
A :  The project manager always works alone .
C :  Do you have new email ?
B :  No . Don't get what's
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay , all set ? Welcome to the conceptual design meeting .
B :  Uh , okay .
C :  Yes .
A :  The agenda . The opening . I'll again be the secretary and make minutes , take minutes , uh and it will be three presentations , just like the last meeting . So um , who wants to start off ? Technical uh designer again ? Okay .
B :  Again .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Uh , yeah . Uh , before we begin it , I want to say I've I've put the minutes of the uh second meeting in the shared folder , but they're still not uh quite okay . It uh it uh still some technical difficulties so the the first part of the minutes are very hard to read , because there are two documents that uh were layered over each other . So But uh , from now on I won't use my pen anymore , so will be p just ordinary keyboard .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Okay .
B :  Uh , may be better , yeah .
D :  Keyboard work . Yeah .
A :  I think it will
A :  will be more uh easy for you to read the minutes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Alright .
C :  Okay , when we talk about uh components design , um it's really about the material and the and uh uh really the stuff we build uh the remote controls of .
C :  Um , a remote control consist of uh components and the components of a remote control consist of uh properties and material . We have to choose th uh these uh wisely and it could affect uh uh a kind of grow of in uh in buying uh the remote controls .
C :  Um , the components of a remote control are of course uh the case . Uh the properties of the case , um it has to be solid uh in hard material like uh hard plastic uh with soft rubber for uh falling and and uh uh yeah , it feels uh good in your hand .
C :  Mm the buttons has to be uh solid too , and the material is soft rubber . Uh I've got a uh email from the possibilities of Real Reaction .
C :  uh they're telling me that um when we build uh a remote control of um of plastic or rubber , the uh buttons have to be uh rubber too . Mm
C :  It's okay . Yeah .
C :  I when we use a rubbled a doubled curved case , we must use a rubber push-buttons to uh the the rubber double-curved case is a is a t uh three-dimensional uh curve in the in the design , which is uh necessary when we want to be trendy . Uh
B :  Oh .
C :  the energy source , uh I've got a lot of possibilities for that too . Um ,
C :  uh the basic battery , which I thi prefer because of its uh its non uh non-depending of of of uh um
C :  Uh here you have to have a hand uh yeah , kinetic uh
C :  energy . Also in uh this one , like in the watches , but a remote control can lie on a table for a day , and then you push uh a button and so you don't have to uh walk with it all the all the time . Mm , solar cells are also uh a bit weird for uh remote controls .
D : 
A : 
C :  uh also the case material , uh I think that plastic is the is the best with rubber , because uh wood or titanium
C :  would also be a bit weird .
B :  Oh titanium is
B :  probably trendy , I think .
D :  That's true , I guess . Yeah .
B :  .
B :  Well , maybe a little bit expensive .
B :  I don't know .
D :  Huh .
C :  Uh , they don't tell anything about the cost of uh titanium .
C :  the chip uh the chip set uh and the board is uh all off the shelf . Also , the speaker in the remote control , when we want to retrieve it . Um , the base station is also off the shelf , all the materials and the
C :  components are uh just available in uh
C :  in our uh factory .
C :  Mm ,
C :  I've told about uh the three first points . Mm , the simple electronical chip uh is is available uh with the LED transmitter uh transmitter . Uh , it's all uh off the shelf and even the speaker and the wireless retriever are all uh available in our company .
C :  Um , another possibility . I uh
C :  yeah , I looked up on was uh the L_C_D_ displays . Could be uh
C :  something special to our uh remote control , and it's possible , but it only cost a bit more , but maybe it can be uh within the limits of twenty five Euros .
A :  Twelve and a half .
C :  Ah yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Actually
B :  Yeah , production cost .
C :  I th I got an email with uh some examples and it these were were the most trendiest one . You see uh a covers , which can be
A :  What are those , t tooth uh brushes , or so
C :  Um , I don't know . Um
A :  But it's actually kind of uh well , it resembles the design I had in mind for this proj You know the the cartoonish Alessi kind of design .
B :  I
C :  Yes .
D :  Yep .
C :  Yes , maybe we can uh bri uh bring a couple of uh couple of types of uh maybe a kind of uh whole uh
A :  And we can we can steal their ideas .
C :  a whole set of uh different uh remote controls . Maybe we can bring a whole line uh with uh
A :  Huh .
C :  with a huge variety of uh
A :  Well , it's a possibility , too .
C :  uh house uh stuff . Like uh maybe radios and uh television also uh in this in this in the same style , but
B :  Different colours also .
A :  Uh-uh .
D :  Yeah , that'll be for the future , I guess .
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , because we have to uh we have to we have to bring the logo and all the stuff uh back into it .
A :  Next time we're here .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Oh , okay .
D :  Yeah . Definitely .
A :  Okay .
D :  Alright .
C :  Thank you .
B :  Okay .
B :  uh
D :  Yeah . That's okay .
B :  Ah .
B :  Well , I shall go to the next slide . Um
B :  um , I still don't have any information about user requirements . I was thinking about just uh the basic functions and I got uh
A :  Oh , we decided upon that in the last meeting .
B :  Yeah , but but then wh I don't know when there are new user requirements . I ha I ha I have the I have
A :  Didn't we ?
A :  Oh , okay . Well , tha I didn't receive any new requirements or somethi Just no , but we decided to use only b basic functions only .
B :  nothing .
B :  Well , I have here a couple of basic functions I could think of .
A :  Okay .
B :  I dunno if they're maybe a little bit more , but
A :  Well we maybe we can think of that later . W just these are the ones you already summed up in the
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , I I uh well , I pointed them out here , just to make it a little bit easier . Um
A :  Okay .
B :  Another function uh is of course we already discuss it on the side . Um , I don't know what costs of it . Uh , I've no idea about it . Uh , I was also looking for what you said , for I got an email uh uh about uh L_C_D_ in in in front of the remote control . I don't know if that's a good idea , or maybe it's a little bit
B :  too much for twelve and a half .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Production . If we got already uh something like a base .
C :  Uh-huh .
A :  That might get redundant also maybe . I don't know what kind of information it would
B :  Yeah , I don't know . I d I uh ju I was just thinking about it . Then I got a pop-ups to go to the meeting . But
D :  Mm yeah .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , it's okay .
C :  Maybe we can bring t uh uh teletext to the t to the remote control .
B :  The remote control . a little uh too A little bit
D :  Then you and then you've got a flag s Very big R_C_ . Yeah .
A :  Okay . That's not
B :  A little bit too big , I think .
A :  It was not a good idea .
B :  Exactly .
A :  Okay .
B :  Um , yeah . Well , the functions are are not more to discuss , I think . It's it's just the base things we already discussed that the no V_C_R_ or that kind of uh , so that's very easy .
A :  No . No .
D :  No .
B :  Um
A :  But you do mention the next and previous uh button .
B :  Mm-hmm . Well , that's next channel . I mean next channel . Uh
D :  Next channel , previous channel .
A :  Oh , okay , o okay okay .
B :  Um oh , I I got an email with with an uh a remote control with a base . So , it's uh just an idea .
A :  Huh .
B :  And I um
B :  uh thinked of the button sizes and I'm not sure uh if they have to be big or uh just small
C :  But you're the expert .
D :  I think it depends on the function .
B :  Well , I'm not a e I'm the expert for user-friendly , but not for trendiness .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Maybe it
D :  Well , if you save uh Perhaps uh s tiny buttons aren't user-friendly , then we wouldn't im implement that of course .
B :  Well uh okay , that's your point . Um , yeah . Yeah , okay .
A : 
B :  Yeah , I've nothing to s
D :  Oh , that's right .
A :  Well , w when we only use basic functions , we have the possibility to make the buttons larger .
B :  Uh , with a little bit larger , yeah . I thought so , but maybe with the
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well , I think we already agreed upon the fact that the the the skip buttons and the cha and the volume buttons , th th those two have yeah , they have to be large . Uh , I mean th th the the two two basic buttons , you know , the to skip channels and to uh
B :  Yeah , that groups . Large ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yep .
A :  I think yeah , I don't know why , but I think that is that's t trendy too , because that's the mo it it you know , it's uh acc acc um accentu uh , how do you say it ?
B :  Most the most used uh buttons .
D :  Those are probably the the th
A :  It puts an extra accent on the the on the simplicity of our remotes to j to make these two most basic functions extra big , like t
D :  Yes .
B :  True . Yeah .
D :  Those are probably the b four most most used buttons on the th in the remote control .
A :  Yeah .
C :  You did the research .
A :  And you want to acc accentuate that , you know .
B :  Yeah .
C :  It's from your research .
D :  Sorry ?
D :  Yeah , sure .
A :  So
B :  Okay . Uh , that was all y uh personal preference I didn't have . I didn't had any time left . So Yeah , .
A :  Okay .
A :  No uh , that's coo it's cool .
D :  You don't care . No , sorry .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Oh .
D :  Go away .
D :  Come on .
B :  It's there .
B :  Yeah , click on it .
D :  .
B :  Couple time .
D :  Oh , great .
D :  Well , I've done some research again about trends on the internet .
D :  Um I've done some investigation , and uh well
D :  I uh got some information from fashion watchers from Paris and uh Milan .
D :  Some uh some findings the most important thing is fancy look and feel of the remote control . Uh , well , we were going to imply that , so that's nice . The second important thing is uh innovative technology in the R_C_ . Uh , our market really likes really likes that . And uh the third point there in this uh order if of importance , the third point , is a high ease of use . And uh , well , for the idea , I've put some trends uh for the market of elderly people . Dark colours , simple recognisable shapes . So we probably won't do that .
D :  The younger market likes uh Well , the themes of of this year are uh surprisingly fruits and vegetables and spongy material . I found this image , which is uh Well , it symbolises the idea of fruits and vegetables . I don't see the spongy part in it . But with a little bit of fancy
A :  Well maybe c then we have to do something with Sponge Bob then .
D :  Exactly . I got some ideas Uh well , yeah , pictures isn't really good word , but um
D :  some symbols of fruits or vegetables maybe . Uh , catchy colours . Fruit is uh yellow , green , red , whatever . So , remote controls in in catchy colours . Uh , no , we don't want dark colours . No , I just put them there to uh , yeah , uh for general idea . And uh , the docking st uh I think the spongy material is is very irritating for the uh remote control itself . But to
A :  It doesn't stroke with the with the dark colours .
A :  Not the dark colours ? Okay .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah , the To implement some spongy thing , maybe we can do it in the in the docking station . At the bottom of the docking station or whatever . And uh , we could bring one line with a dark colour uh to um uh p uh yeah uh uh v how do you say ?
A :  For diversity or something . Uh
D :  Yeah , also a bit for elderly people who are a little bit crazy and want maybe want a little younger design but still the dark colour . I mean it it it reaches a different market uh , but it it it doesn't cost really much effort to b to uh bring uh like a black R_C_ on the market or whatever . Yes .
B :  Well , how uh
B :  But how do we use uh fruits and vegetables in Christ's sake with remote control ? Uh , make it a banana ?
A :  No , but I I I think that uh our design already resembles so a piece of fruit . It's like a pear or something .
D :  Yeah , there's there's always a
D :  Well there there's always empty space of course on a remote control . I mean I think this part of the R_C_ uh well the upper the upper part or whatever is uh is not not used with buttons , I guess . So you you can put some fruity things
A :  No , I don't think you have to do it like
A :  Yeah , but it that doesn't have to remind you , you know , like explicitly of s our f of a of a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like the the the the round curves . And so y I I think this y it already sem resembles uh something like a pear to me or something .
D :  No , of course not .
D :  Especially i
B :  Yeah , but th yeah , but that
D :  Yeah , yeah . Yeah , exactly .
B :  Yeah , but that's
D :  If we make it little bit greenish .
A :  Yeah .
A :  You do get the idea , eh ? The fruity kind of round 'Kay .
B :  Yeah uh uh
D :  A and we could use one of these for the uh w what is it ?
A :  Yeah , uh yeah , I don't know . Uh , this is a b yeah .
C :  Grapes .
D :  Uh
D :  Isn't
D :  Wha whatever .
B :  But d don't we need a creative artist or something like that to m make it to feel like a a a a vegetable or fruit ?
A :  Yeah , yeah . Of course we have uh
D :  Yeah , sure .
D :  Yeah .
A :  we have a very big uh the s
D :  Well , w we can uh w we can we can produce multiple uh multiple things . This is then the uh pear . I don't know the English word , so forget it . And um , maybe , yeah , a b a banana is uh is n not easy for a remote control , but m yeah .
C :  For a big team of artists .
A :  Of d design team , yeah .
A :  Yeah , but
A :  It's pear , I guess .
C :  But uh but I think we don't have to make
C :  we can't make all uh ten designs . We have to make one design I th I I think .
A :  No .
A :  No , but I think it's it's already what we were were up to . Uh , it's it doesn't have to resemble uh what I already said , a specific piece of fruit , but just , you know , like a fruity thing going on . And it's it looks fruity to me .
D :  Mayb maybe two or three .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
D :  No sure , but but
D :  B but that's great , and and and what I was what what I was saying , the catchy colours
A :  And uh , but I do like the yeah , I do like uh the f uh to the idea of making a a y uh , a catchy colour design and a d because I do I think a dark colour would be nice too .
C :  But pictures of fruit , vegetables vegetables
D :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe it's too much , you know .
B :  But , we we have to um There have to be the the the the firm colours , our own uh colours has to be in it . Yellow , a Real Reaction .
D :  Yeah , uh not really . Pictures was a was a bad word , but
A :  Okay , but what are the This is yellow .
D :  Well we c yeah .
C :  Yes , you can put a logo on top of it .
A :  But I don't think our our company colours are this fashionable .
D :  Yeah , sure .
B :  Uh , yeah .
D :  Maybe we can if if we got our docking station over here . I can't draw with this thing , but I'll try . If this is our docking station , we can make our logo over here . It doesn't work . And then
C :  Yes , it's really fruity .
B :  We uh f
B :  A yellow do
B :  Uh , yeah .
B :  Yeah , and the button then .
C :  With a strawberry on top .
A :  Yeah , on uh n uh on the bottom of the remote you can do
D :  Well , the button button over here or whatever , I don't know .
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  On the front , of course , because else you can't find it .
B :  Okay .
D :  Well , that were my ideas a little bit .
D :  I'll close 'em down . Um , go away .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , you can you open the conceptual design presentation ?
D :  Conceptual design , yes .
A :  See what was on the agenda .
B :  Lazy .
D :  The agenda .
A :  This is his own remote . Because um , maybe we can start with the technical uh functions , but I don't think it's there uh , yeah um , do we want to um use an L_C_D_ display , for example ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  Well , it's nice , of course . But I don't I don't know what to display on it . I mean
C :  Only if we
C :  Maybe maybe we can make a T_V_ guide on it , for the channel you're on .
A :  Me neither .
D :  Yeah , but it should be li like this big , and I don't think
A :  Yeah , but it's so
C :  No , no , only the T_V_ channel with the with uh with uh four programmes . You can uh zap through them with the page up page down button .
A :  I don't think we should do it .
D :  Yes sure , but it it has to to show an entire title of a programme or at least a q a quite quite large part of it and then you get a very large L_C_D_ screen , because
C :  Yes , it can
C :  On your
C :  No , on your mobile phone you can y you can read text also . So why not on your remote ?
A :  Yeah , but no . I do I think it's a bit redundant , actually . And it's also not I don't th even think it it looks s like sexy or something , it's
D :  Yeah , I don't know .
B :  Well well what would you display on it then ?
C :  Uh , programme uh information or or or or g or a guide
D :  Programme information . But
B :  But is it isn't that a already on T_V_ , a lot of new T_V_s ?
C :  on t on teletext , yes . Also on the internet . But
D :  Well a lot a lot of T_V_s indeed show uh when you uh zap to a
A :  But you're already watching the T_V_ , you're not gonna watch your remote control .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , but you also want to know what's next .
D :  But then we also uh w need to bring out a line of T_V_s which we were planning to , but whatever . Because the T_V_ has to send information back to the R_C_ , and I don't know if that's possible .
B :  Yeah , and we also have to yeah .
C :  Yes , that's uh really possible .
D :  Yes , yes , o of course it's possible , but you gotta uh implement it in the T_V_s , and I don't think everyone's gonna buy a Real Reaction T_V_ within a month after the release of our uh remote control .
B :  And I also
A :  I really understand you want to make your job more exciting by putting an L_C_D_ in it , but I I really don't think it's a good n goo because it also doesn't stroke with we wanted uh c When we talk about the materials , uh it's a good idea to use these plastic materials with soft rubber stuff on it . It was our idea , you know , to give it a more sturdy look and that you ca like you can throw with it . But I don't think a L_C_D_ display fits in that image . You know , it's like more vulnerable , and it adds nothing really , you know .
D :  Yeah .
D :  That's true , that's true , it breaks f yeah , it it it's not very solid , it's uh frag fragile .
A :  Yeah , yeah . You could make it , but it's just it it doesn't I don't think it it's coherent with the design we're after .
D :  No . No . I don't think so ei either .
A :  But that's my opinion . Well , you you y Okay , we can vote for it . You want the L_C_D_ display . I don't want to and he doesn't , so it's up to him . If we wanna
C :  No .
D :  . Ah .
B :  Yeah , I dunno .
A :  And I've read somewhere that I've got some kind of veto veto uh rights .
B :  . Oh , okay .
D :  Bastard .
A :  So I can also say
B :  We can you away .
A :  But did we skip the Yeah , you could do m but what what i so what i but do you think we should
B :  Yeah , I don't know . Uh , uh I i if it's it's a simple p
A :  We're not even sure what what information we want to display on it . So
B :  No , that that's right , and uh I also have to think about new functions , maybe buttons or something like that to control it . Kind of L_C_D_ or something or
C :  No uh um
C :  Y yes , you can use uh buttons uh uh w that are already uh on the remote control for double functions .
D :  Yeah , I guess .
B :  But how does it display then ? W when I go to the second channel , what what does it show me ?
C :  Uh , then you push a button .
C :  The title and the information about the programme . But but uh yeah , what he said was right , about the televisions , they have to be uh customised to the
B :  About that programme ?
A :  Nah , that's not gonna work .
D :  No .
C :  But maybe in future it will be a giant hit , and when you are the first
A :  Yeah .
A :  Oh , well uh I've seen it done before . Do you know th like the the bigger rem uh universal remotes , they have d L_C_D_ displays , but then it's very functional to indicate which what uh uh device you are controlling . So it's that that's what I've seen .
C :  you have the biggest uh
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's true , if you uh Yeah .
C :  Yes , you can put uh a little L_C_D_ display on it with uh with lots of information . But uh I haven't thought about it .
A :  But it just it j it doesn't doesn't match with the our whole basic concept .
C :  But whe but when you put a a a transparent uh plastic uh
C :  uh screen on top of it , it i it isn't vulnerable . You can throw with it and
A :  Well yeah , yeah , okay . That's maybe not the most important , but it's just
B :  Is it fashion ?
C :  When when you put uh maybe a colour L_C_D_ t uh screen on it , it's very special and very trendy to have uh a remote control from
A :  I don't think so .
B :  I don't know . That's not up to you . That's up to market if i if it's trendy . Because our our motto is we put fashion
A :  Yeah , well do you ha do you have to You haven't looked after the trendiness of L_C_D_ displays , have you ?
D :  No .
D :  Well , I think it's uh I think it's pretty trendy , to be honest , uh but um I don't know if if if well , I'm coming back to the costs again , but I think uh we gotta build a b pretty cheap design to to stay within our limits . And I think uh especially colour L_C_D_ , which is indeed pretty trendy . But I don't think Uh , I think it will be too expensive .
C :  But uh I've got a the email with uh with the possibilities . And L_C_D_ was a possibility for the remote control . So why don't we use it .
A :  Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Uh , did it say a price also uh for for uh monogramme uh L_C_D_ or uh coloured L_C_D_ ?
A :  Yeah , but we're gonna if it
B :  Yeah , if you want to be trendy you have to be coloured . Coloured
D :  Yeah really , if y if you c i
B :  If you have black and white or something , or grey , that's
D :  I in in two thousand and four you can't uh put something on the market which is a monogramme . Really .
A :  Then uh then you better don't yeah , d
C :  No , but it doesn't sa say anything about a colour or But , mm ,
C :  I alf I also got a possibility to put uh a scroll button on it . But
A :  Uh uh I really don't feel the whole idea of an L_C_D_ display . I'm sorry . It can't co you cannot convince me . I don't know how well how to with you guys , but
C :  I didn't think that
A :  I don't really feel it . We already we're uh Yeah , we already have the the th th th base station gadgets , and want and it uh uh , do it has to be a simple design , which sturdy , which soft
B :  It's too much uh maybe uh with with the L_C_D_ and the docking station and
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , but o on the
D :  W we've we've gotta find a balance , of course . And I think
B :  With one thing special . Not a whole package of specialty .
A :  I don't think
A :  I j uh , and really , I don't see how the the L_C_D_ display is gonna add anything , you know , on a design level . Uh , I think it's slicker to have no L_ CEDs . Y we want to it's simplicity , w you have two big buttons and you can do whatever you want with these two buttons , so you don't need an L_C_D_ .
C :  No , when y
C :  But it look
C :  Yes , but that remote controls are already on the market . The simple
A :  It doesn't fit in our philosophy uh behind the whole remote .
C :  Yes , but but when you want to have something special
A :  Yeah , but we already have the docking station , which is
C :  Yes , but you had a picture of it from another company .
D :  We have a pear .
B :  And uh the
A :  It has to be developed , but no , but it that's that's our that's our killer feature . That's our what makes it special .
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's just an it's just an idea . It's a it's
C :  Yes , it was already made . Tha the remote control on the docking station .
A :  Yeah , we're gonna develop our own r n docking station .
B :  True .
D :  Is that so ? Was it it wasn't just a prototype ?
C :  Yes , he have a picture of it .
B :  Well uh I uh
B :  Yeah , I dunno .
D :  Exactly , I've never seen it in a store .
A :  Uh , but re we really have to cut this off , I re I know you I I I I I get the idea you really like it , you know , the the L_C_D_ thing , but I I think it's it's not a good idea , and we have already mentioned all the arguments . I don't uh , do you guys agre How do you guys think ? I d
B :  No , it's too much .
D :  I think it's a little too much , yeah .
B :  It's overdone .
A :  Okay , we s skip the L_C_D_ display . I'm sorry , maybe you can do something if we are at your own place , or make it make it make it happen in your basement or something .
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Democratically .
D :  No .
D :  .
C :  Mayb
C :  I will rule the world with it .
A :  But
A :  Probably so . Okay . But for the technical part . The m material , I think uh it was a good idea to use the plastic and uh the rubber . Uh
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .
C :  Yes , maybe a bit of a cushion is
A :  Yeah yeah yeah , p Exactly . This is what it w Yeah , but it it was already what we're uh we're after , you know , to give it uh , you know , the soft touch in your hands and also to , know , like Yeah , that is y the b airbag kind of thing . You can st throw it at your little brother's head .
D :  Yeah , for the spongy uh feel . Yeah .
C :  Yes .
B :  With a spongy Bob feel .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Like a b yes .
B :  Yeah , you just can drop it . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , airbag .
D :  If you drop it if you drop it the airbag comes out , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . No no no , not that comfy .
C :  Maybe it but then we have to look that it uh w uh will not um be too childish to see .
A :  Yeah yeah . Yeah . Okay , that's a that's a good point . And that's why I like the dark t col dark colour bit , you know , because it may be the design uh , it's uh maybe it is a bit of the
D :  Yeah .
B :  But not black I think .
A :  it's a bit nineties maybe , what we're what we're up to rat fun to this point .
D :  No .
B :  Well if if it's fruit and vegetables , it have to be colourful .
A :  Yeah , that's that's true , but but it has to be a little big solid . It mustn't be too , n you know , th too overwhelming , then when you put it on your just
D :  Yeah , b yeah , that's what w I I was pointing at .
B :  But can we ge uh uh
B :  Can we combine it or something ? Uh with uh yellow and black ?
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , maybe so .
B :  Make it a bee ?
D :  What ? Oh , a bee . Oh .
B :  A bee .
A :  No , uh I don't like the yellow and black combination . But it is our company colours . Apparently .
C :  Yes , real real good colours .
B :  Yeah , it's our yeah . We we have to use yellow .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  I don't like yellow , and uh maybe I don't know .
D :  Well , we can as as I
C :  But that's not really fruity .
D :  draw really nicely over there . We can put the logo on our uh on our base station . Uh , yeah . And maybe very very tiny on the remote control itself . But , i
A :  But
A :  Okay , but what uh , what are other tef technical things we have to discuss ?
C :  Uh fronts
C :  of the
C :  We can have uh different uh uh fronts of the
A :  Should we do that ? I don't think you we should do that . Maybe just bring it out in different colours , but not af that you can switch fronts afterwards , that's also too much . People don't wanna spend more money on their remote control , I guess .
C :  telephone .
B :  Different fronts .
D :  Yeah . I guess that's that's enough .
D :  That's way too Nokia .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh , you can you can l uh let choose the customer which colour he wants , yeah . Yeah , Three three or four uh four uh colours , or something like that .
C :  Are these designs ?
A :  Yeah , yeah .
D :  Yeah , definitely . Just bring more designs on the market .
D :  Why not , yeah .
A :  But uh , without gon uh okay . So , are we through the technical part then ?
C :  Yes .
A :  Okay . So we uh agreed upon uh n uh well , not u unanimously or how you call it , but Yeah .
C :  It this a real uh young young and dynamic uh uh styles .
B :  Well , yeah , the
B :  Three to one . That's
A :  The materials you uh mentioned in your your personal preferences were all were quite okay . O o only only the last point your no titanium's not not out of question , I guess .
C :  Yes .
B :  And tita uh titanium , is uh is is it a no ? Is
C :  Yes ,
C :  But also w
B :  It's just like that , th this titanium .
C :  Yes , b bu but when we use s soft
A :  But is it possible to use both the the plastic and so uh soft things and t p titanium , as well ? Makes it in a homogeneous uh design .
C :  mm
D :  Sure .
C :  Mm .
B :  No , not all , not all of them .
C :  But it it then it uh you can't throw it it . It will uh make a huge noise or break other stuff
C :  when you throw with uh titanium with your remote control . No uh ,
A :  It will it will break other stuff w when it's plastic , as well .
A :  Yeah .
C :  titanium is a bit uh it's a bit harder . But also on the colours , the young
D :  Yeah , that's true .
A :  No , but uh uh , you should ma Yeah .
A :  Okay , think of the possibilities and make it in completely titanium . Well would it be more trendy ? More chic ?
D :  Yeah , I think it I think it does .
B :  Uh , I think titanium nowadays is way more often used than plastic .
C :  Yes , but a titanium remote control , when you're uh watching T_V_ uh or your hands are a little bit sweaty , and the
B :  In trendy things .
D :  Yeah , o
D :  On the other hand , if you want to make fruit fruity stuff with uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  It's cold in the winter .
C :  Yes .
A :  Yeah , but I I really like the idea of the the the plastic and the big kind of thing . But the question is i then it's , you know , is is it fits in our s philosophy to make it uh sturdy and simple and uh , know , like uh
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , that's true , that's true .
C :  Sports and gaming . Define .
A :  When you make it titanium , it becomes more like some kind of gadget you actually don't need . And when it's big and plastic , it's like some fun stuff you can always have around . It's always fun to have something big and plastic around .
B :  You have that uh M_P_ three player of Nike , I saw . Isn't that titanium with a little bit of rubber ?
D :  Yes . Yeah .
C :  Yes , it's w but it is uh plastic .
B :  Isn't it
B :  Is plastic ? Well , it's titanium looking .
C :  Yes , w we can do that on the on the
D :  What ?
B :  Yeah , he is . Here he is . Uh , the I don't know if you know the M_P_ three player of Nike . 'Kay , uh that that's very uh with rubber , so it's very
D :  Oh , yeah . Okay , yeah .
A :  Yeah , that's beautiful .
D :  Yeah , I see .
C :  We can make this as a style too . Uh , this is uh just a
D :  Yeah , but but but
B :  rough .
D :  Yeah , I th I think that's difficult , because uh that's different material , and then you gotta have like uh uh uh two material lines of of of
A :  Oh , maybe th maybe this is an
C :  No , we c we can make it from the same kind of plastic .
D :  Yeah , if it's just a colour uh which you uh which you change then , I guess it's it's nice to have one of these .
D :  Uh
C :  Uh
A :  No , I do like the idea of maybe a t titanium kind type of body w and then with s plastic colouration around it . You know , like the the soft stuff , but I don't know if it's possible .
D :  Yeah .
C :  I don't have the information . Uh , I I didn't got it
A :  But you can't make the plastic give uh the ti titanium look . But make it just like shiny . Maybe we should uh shou
C :  Yes .
B :  True .
D :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Yeah yeah , true . Yeah , maybe that's good idea , yeah . But if you want to la uh yeah , last longer than two weeks or something like that , you can maybe
C :  Like the M_P_ three player .
D :  Yeah .
A :  And uh and
A :  maybe we sh should we t I don't know if we should talk about uh , how how much time have we got left ?
C :  Uh , in a lot of other uh
B :  I don't know . What time does
A :  Forty minutes .
C :  in a lot of other product uh categories like uh even in b in bags industry . Uh , they began with uh t typical uh leather bags , but then they became stylish , with all all si all sort of colours , and w kind of fon of uh of fronts , like we can use on the telephone and it
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  Like Eastpack uh began a revolution with it with all this uh kind of bags and and colours and and
A :  You putting in different colours .
C :  Yes , and and styles . They have uh also uh a kind of uh um
A :  Okay .
C :  uh roses on it , a and uh
D :  Uh yeah , yeah .
A :  Okay . Yeah , but w yeah . Well , it is . It's a possibility . But , let's think about the bas
C :  Then we can always uh use the same design for a greater resemblance , but with new uh with new colours , new yes .
D :  Yes .
D :  New prints on it . Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm , mm-hmm . But wha th our basic idea y I mean , you gonna we're probably gonna have like two type of materials , like the d d b the plastic uh enclosure and then the the pads that surround it . And and pro and lights . We have to incorporate the lights too . But , uh do w gonna gonna are we going to give it a two-tone colour look , like the the plastic mould is in in one colour and the s the cushion pads around it are in another colour ? Is that the idea ? Is that a good idea ?
D :  How do you mean ? Th th the uh base in a in another
B :  The rubber .
A :  How many colours are we how many colours are we gonna we're uh uh f uh f Only five minutes left , by the way . How many colours are we gonna give it ? Like two-tone colour ? T
D :  Yes .
C :  There there are three uh components three components type . You have the buttons , the the case uh itself , and the rubber and th
B :  Yeah . Uh no , not too much I think .
D :  How the buttons yeah .
A :  I think maybe the case itself should be in one colour and then the rubber of the buttons , and the cushions as well should be in another colour .
C :  Yes .
B :  Or you just make uh one colour , uh maybe with a a z a kind of like a big wave or something like uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , but not more than Well , yeah , it's No . Maybe we should talk about it on a l in a later meeting .
B :  In in another colour . Not more than two colours I think . It's a g a little bit too flashy .
D :  No , definitely not .
D :  Yes , definitely .
C :  Yeah , or or when you use the buttons as black , it you can use two colours as well uh
A :  Okay . But we have to uh think of some other uh important things . Uh oh yeah , the the functionalities of the the buttons .
B :  The funct yeah , I was I was thinking about th the st do we still want a joystick idea .
A :  No .
D :  No , I think that's too vulnerable .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I think this is okay , the so we have the basic . Then we have the numbers . We have the power button . We have we have a teletext button .
B :  The volume , teletext and
A :  And maybe want to access a a menu or something . Most T_V_s have a menu .
D :  Yeah , but that's that's I was thinking that's gotta be on the television .
A :  Yeah , but I think you ha I really need a menu button . That's just i the only button only
B :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah , b
B :  Yeah , but wha what kind of menu ? Is uh isn't that different from every television ?
A :  You know , I
A :  No , I think most T_V_s have an uh a menu nowadays to access the uh uh screen settings . And so
D :  Mm . Yeah , if it's c if
D :  Yeah , I think it's okay to to add a menu button for uh and if the T_V_ doesn't have a menu , then
A :  But that that covers all the all the other settings . It covers everything then .
C :  But then you have to put uh up and down and uh left and right
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , you can put that on the two eight four and six or whatever .
A :  No , you can use the
A :  And you al can also use the normal skip buttons for that . Th in that way we have like only the numbers , the power button , skip and volume , and then uh uh ten uh rem uh yeah , mute . A teletext and a menu , and then then i that's it . It's all we need . Okay , uh another stuf some stuff about the the the design of the docking station . Something important about a s uh , no , uh which sh uh should remind us of the remote itself , I guess .
C :  Okay .
D :  Mm , yeah .
D :  A mute and a teletext and a menu .
B :  Mute .
D :  That's all .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Great . Yeah .
B :  Okay , that's not mu not much functions . So
D :  Yeah , definitely . Are we gonna do something with the uh spongy thing there ?
A :  Uh , in one colour . Just use
A :  I think the spongy thing already um comes forward in the in the in the cushions , pads and things on the s uh side . And we will make it spongy and and uh and uh well , the fruity thing is just the shape should be fru i did I think this is kind of fruity , you know . Just round shapes with uh
C :  Uh
D :  Yeah , that's true , that's true .
D :  Yeah , it's kinda fruity , and with th with catchy colours uh uh w
A :  Yeah , but we're gonna have to we really have to think I think colours is very important , because it has to be flashy , but and but it d it doesn't have to be annoying , that when you uh , know , some things is just over the top , and when you have it on your table for more than two weeks , you it just gets annoying , because it's so big and flashy . Uh , it has to be some level of subtlety , but we have to still have to think of how we manage to uh
D :  Yeah , definitely .
A :  to get to that .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Guess we're through then .
D :  Okay .
B :  Okay .
D :  I guess so .
A :  But we I think also we just so we have to do something with colour but also , I I think we have to keep the dark colour thing in mind . I think that's uh adds to the too much colour maybe m um
D :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Too much colour , i it uh when you got it in a living room , it's too much maybe . It has to be
A :  But our des design experts will uh work that out . Okay , well I think the meeting will be over within a minute . So we will wrap up .
D :  Yea yeah .
D :  Yep .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Something like that .
A :  Or is there anything we'd like to discuss ?
D :  I guess not .
A :  That's right .
A :  Okay .
D :  Do you , guys ?
B :  No .
D :  No ?
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , you will read the minutes uh in the you can find them in the pro probably . Yeah uh no , for su for sure because I'm will now type them out .
D :  In the shared folder .
B :  Oh , okay , yeah .
C :  What are we going to do now ?
A :  Uh , y yeah .
D :  You'll see in you email , I guess .
B :  Yeah . I hope so . And the other thing is that you don't have kind of prototype or something like that . You see a kinda prototype you can a little bit more uh
A :  I think uh
D :  Yeah , I don't know . I don't know .
C :  I will make one in the next uh twenty minutes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Construct one , yeah .
A :  But toilet paper roll and uh
B :  With you laptop ? Yeah .
B :  Oh my God .
A :  Okay .
D :  Alright , shall we get back to work ? Great .
A :  Yep . I was waiting for the l last message , but
B :  Well you are . We're not .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Bastard .
C :  Back to the pen .
D :  You lazy
A :  Mm yeah .
A :  Okay . Uh door is closed . Well , let's begin . Because if we have as much time as the last uh meeting , we'll have to hurry up . Um well I'll start with the presentation again , the agenda .
D :  I'm listening .
D :  Right .
D :  Great .
A :  Yo .
A :  So . Uh This one I think . Uh yeah . Well alright .
A :  Um well , I'll show you the notes . It's not as uh interesting as it should be because we just uh had the meeting , but I'll show them . We'll get your presentations again on the conceptual design . Um
A :  Then we'll have to dec decide about the control , the remote control concepts . I've put a f uh a file in the project management folder , which says exactly uh what kind of decisions we should take . So this time we exactly know what to decide about . And then we'll close again .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Alright , great .
C :  Alright .
A :  Uh
A :  Well these are some examples , but we'll talk about them later . We'll first look at your uh presentations . Alright ?
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Walter will uh start again this time ?
D :  Yeah , great .
A :  Yo .
D :  Alright , Trendwatch .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Right .
D :  I will speak about uh latest trends trends , latest fashion updates , and uh things we must not do . Uh the trends . It's very important that uh the control is fancy looking and good uh feeling .
A :  'Kay .
D :  Uh this because of our last model was very functional , but it uh people didn't like that , so our new mo model must be very good-looking . That's uh something you uh have to take a look at . And uh the feeling has to be very great . Also the menus and things like that they have to they have to feel great .
C :  Mm-hmm . Alright .
C :  Alright .
D :  Um there's a minus uh two times here , because this is the most important point . This is uh two times as less important , and uh same for this one . Um , technological technological innovations , that's uh regarded very highly too .
A :  Less .
D :  Uh such as an uh L_C_D_ screen , uh speech uh acknowledgement , as we uh talked about earlier . So we have to have uh something like that , like we uh
A :  Well , yeah .
A :  L_C_D_ and our uh our fronts .
D :  Right . Uh the last point is easy to use . Well I think that uh speaks for s for itself . I don't know who's uh who's going to look at that . Yeah ?
C :  Easy to use ? I think that's your ta
A :  Well , easy to use uh s is a bit uh contradictionary with the first uh Functional is not an issue , and then easy to use . Well we have to choose one of them .
D :  Yeah , I know .
D :  I think we have to go for the first one . It's the most important one . So we have to uh take that one .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  Okay .
D :  So it it it isn't very important that that it works easy . But it has to look great .
B :  Well something fancy looking can be can be easy to use .
A :  Yeah . We'll we'll look at uh .
D :  We'll see .
C :  You Yeah . Yeah , yeah , you can make a very complicated uh uh remote anyway , so ease of use It's not a very comp complicated device .
D :  Yeah , right .
D :  But the most important thing is that it looks great and people say wow , that's real great uh great concept . Alright . Uh these are the new colours of this year . So it must be very bright , very colourful . People like this .
C :  Alright .
A :  'Kay .
C : 
D :  So we we have to think uh in this direction . So i set your mind to it . Findings ? Fashion update ? Fruit and vegetables are cool . I am told .
A :  So
A :  Well
C :  Uh you think ?
D :  The group we are targeting is uh very pleased with fruit and vegetables . So we we we might cons consider in front of uh in in that sort of uh way . Uh furthermore uh material , that's your part , should be very strong . I was thinking of something like uh well uh iron plate over it , maybe in a colour or something , that looks so f really flashy but it it is also strong . And that's uh also for the younger public .
A :  Yeah , well
B :  Bananas .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Well the the handy thing about our fronts is that we can follow these trends e ev every year . Th this year it's fruits but next year it's it's something totally different .
D :  Yeah , that's great . But I think we can all make the the fronts of titanium or something uh really thin . So it looks very heavy but you can still uh use it very easily .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yes .
C :  Mm .
A :  Yep , alright .
D :  Well , the don'ts . Older people like dark colours and simple shapes . Well we don't want uh older people , we want young people . So uh we're gonna turn that around . We're gonna have real uh cool shapes and lots of colours . Right ? Okay .
C : 
C :  Alright .
A :  Wood is popular . Aha .
D :  We don't want wood .
C :  Yeah , among the old people , yeah .
A :  Yeah yeah yeah .
D :  Old people . So , that's it for me .
A :  Alright . Nice , uh well show us .
C :  Right , I am going to tell you something about the components design .
C :  Uh again I have uh put up the specification properties . This uh so um uh the different uh components of the of of the device . And the materials ? Um I have heard several things , so I uh I'll have to change that on the way .
C :  But uh the case ? Uh I suggested uh in the previous meeting hard plastic . But uh as you indicated uh it should be strong . It should feel strong . So maybe plastic is not uh sufficient . We should move to uh something
D :  Yeah , we should change that .
A :  Well maybe it it it is , but it doesn't look strong . So maybe
C :  Well yeah . Y Hard plastic i is of course uh pretty pretty tough , but it doesn't have a really really tough look . So
D :  No no no .
A :  But we still have to look at our price of course . Because uh if we want an L_C_D_ uh window etcetera uh
C :  Yeah . Also Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm . But we'll return to that . Uh the buttons of course rubber , I think everyone agrees . And electrical cables , copper is all pretty basic stuff . The chips made of silicon , I guess . I think that's the best uh way to do it . And infra infrared l LED is uh just a simple bulb .
A :  Yeah ?
C :  Then I've uh had a few findings , made a few findings . Uh the target audience product style . Um it's uh um generally the case that uh senior and wealthy people above uh forty five years old uh like , as you said , uh particularly the traditional materials as such as wood and materials such as that .
C :  They also like straightforward shapes and luxurious style . But of course that's not our uh things this . So this is things we must not do . And then we have uh young uh and dynamic uh people , which is of course our uh group , the people we aim at . Um under forty five years old . Uh they like soft materials uh with primary colours .
A :  Yes .
C :  Soft materials is of course uh agai again a bit a contradiction with uh our uh material choice of what you said , that uh it should be hard an and and and and strong looking . But they like soft materials , uh so we might uh we have to consider that . And
D :  Mm . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  also they like curved round shapes . So not uh too formal like like uh the older people want . And if uh also a finding but not very ap applicable here , that sports and gaming devices such as uh
C :  discmans for jogging and that those kind of devices , gaming devices , should define the characteristics of the device . But uh since we don't have a really a sports or gaming device , so we don't really have to consider that .
A :  Sports uh , they're uh that uh are accessible on on your L_C_D_ uh window uh Huh ? That's nice .
B :  Soccer fronts . Mm .
C :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
C :  Well I also have um
A :  All the results ?
D :  We keep coming back to the fronts .
B :  Yeah .
C :  several examples of uh styles , so you can get a clear picture of uh what I mean .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Uh these are the basic uh older older peoples' stuff .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  It was not very uh interesting uh , very classical looking , but that's n that's not what we want . We have these kind of things . I don't know what exactly they are . It looks like Well you know uh you recognise the shapes , it's very primary colours , uh bright colours and uh round shapes . You also uh see uh this device , it's not very round and Fruity of course . Yeah , it uh That's true .
A :  Mm-hmm . Nai . Uh no .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Fruity . Fruity .
A :  It's t terrible . Alright .
C :  And uh well round shapes , primary colours . You can see it all here . And of course uh this famous device . I think as you know something uh some devices like this . So to give you an idea of uh
A :  Hmm ?
A :  Yeah , alright .
D :  Well it's got a strong look , this . Yeah .
C :  This has a strong look . Although it's plastic , it's it's grey to to to give it iron look . That's uh
D :  Yeah , it still has a strong look .
A :  Yeah . And it's round .
D :  But then you are losing your fruity colours .
C :  Yeah . Well we have to make a
A :  Well you can make th th th that middle ring can you you can make another colour . So uh those kind of things you can you can combine .
D :  That's true .
C :  Well we can't really make a round uh a round remote control . I don't think that's very practical , but But uh it's important to to uh to think about the colour . Because if we make it grey or or silvery looking , it it does make it a lot more uh does make it looking a lot more stronger . 'Cause if you look at this , it it doesn't look very very strong , becau But this is plastic , and and this too , but
A :  No , it isn't .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah but the
A :  Yes .
D :  But it doesn't have to look strong . The the results are , the feel of the material is expected to be strongy . The feel .
C :  The feel ? Uh alright . Well
A :  So , if you ti
B :  And it it doesn't have to be strong , also . Only the feel .
A :  Well
D :  Nah yeah the feel
A :  You you Maybe you should have uh some some coloured titanium or something . So it it looks pretty but it feels strong .
D :  Right .
C :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh .
D :  I agree .
C :  And I Then I have some more findings . Um uh about the energy energy source of the of the device , uh I uh suggest uh the basic battery . I uh got some other um uh uh energy sources of course . But solar energy is not very practical inside a house , because you don't have a have a lot of uh sun .
C :  And uh kinetic and and and dynamos are are not very practical , I think , for uh for a simple remote , that's a bit , oh , that's a bit uh
A :  No titanium .
C :  That's a bit uh much . And I also suggest uh as a shape uh a double curved case . Uh the disadvantage of that that you can use no titanium . That that's the information I received . If you use the curved case , uh a curved case , double curved then you
A :  What do you exactly mean with double curved ?
C :  can't use titanium . Now uh this uh to give it a more modern look . And uh now the the shape , yeah , a curved case . Um yeah I think uh sort of triangle-shaped bottom or something . Uh a more modern look not plain , long box style , but
D :  I dunno .
A :  Double curved ?
C :  I'll draw it , but maybe later . And it makes uh it gives it a more u user friendly shape , than if you have uh . Um anyway
B :  Yeah . Yeah .
A :  It it mean Yeah , well okay .
C :  Um f as uh for the buttons , simple push buttons . No uh otherwi uh no um difficult scroll things or some uh things like that , because it makes more complex and expensive .
C :  And , uh as we agreed , we don't use a speaker or a sensor or um uh speak uh speech uh controlled device . Because it makes it also more complex and expensive . But we do use an L_C_D_ screen , so we uh we do have to consider uh of we have to use a more advanced chip , which is more complex and expensive . But
D :  Yeah right .
A :  Well
C :  It's worth the trouble I think , because
B :  The buttons can be made of an uh a soft material .
B :  Because people like that .
A :  This soft material thing from uh Yeah .
C :  Uh rubber is a soft material , I guess . Uh soft enough . So that's uh basically what I want to talk about .
D :  Yeah . Right .
B :  Yeah . Right . Yeah .
A :  Alright . Okay . We will take that . And then uh Mike ?
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well um nah the method um we will um include the buttons as we discussed uh earlier .
B :  Um an L_C_D_ s screen will be implemented . Um we must decide where , this meeting . Um there are new developments in speech recognition um systems , um and they are already being uh used on uh coffee machines . And um well they're cheap , so we could use them now .
A :  Oh
B :  Um it's not really speech recognition , it's more um like you can um talk to the chip , uh record the message and record an answer , and then once you uh talk to the remote , then um he will a answer with the
A :  That's interesting .
B :  the prerecorded message that you left . So if I say hi Mike , and you have recorded uh hi Mike back , then you will get that .
C :  Oh , yeah , I understand . Yeah .
D :  Oh okay .
A :  Okay . But you can also say that , when you say something , it does some function .
D :  Right .
B :  No it doesn't does not do anything . But i it's just a Yeah it's it's cheap .
D :  No .
A :  Oh .
D :  But that that makes it cheap . It's it's just a an extra function , and it's cheap .
A :  That's a bit uh
C :  Yeah .
A :  Yes . I understand . But it has no functionality for our remote at all .
D :  No but
B :  No but that's the gadget they want , or the gimmicks .
D :  Yeah , right . Young people love them .
C :  But it it's n nice for young people . They like gadgets . Yeah .
B :  Yes , we we should really uh include that one , I think . Um
D :  Yeah , ple
D :  Right .
C :  If it's cheap . Yeah .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Well , as I said uh earlier I think the uh L_C_D_ screen should be uh positioned at the lower end of the remote . Um the buttons for screen width and general settings and uh and that kind of stuff
B :  um we can also do let that kind of functions um be shown in the L_C_D_ screen , uh instead of uh extra buttons . I think young people and yeah w well every user would like that .
A :  So you put a menu in the L_C_D_ ?
B :  Um the buttons um should be positioned uh positioned the same way as they are on a , well , conventional remote , I think . For the learnability and uh well to keep it recognisable . A voice recognition can be uh implemented .
B :  And uh I drew an example , but it did not work quite the well uh the way I wanted it to do . Hmm ? Well I have the I can draw it again , and I know what I did wrong . I didn't tick the note bo box in the . Um
D :  Alright . How How
C :  Can you draw it now of uh Can you draw it now ?
A :  Ah .
C :  Mm . Alright .
D :  How do you uh uh give input to the menu on the L_C_D_ screen ?
B :  Um with the uh the up and down and and well buttons and the
D :  Alright . So you have a menu button , and then you can go up and down .
B :  Well I will draw what I had drawn on the screen .
A :  But then we should also have an uh an Okay button .
D :  Yeah right .
B :  Yes . Um I shall draw this . If it uh works .
C :  button , yeah .
A :  Just uh There is already a blank . Yes ? So Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mm so have I .
B :  Nah .
D :  .
D :  You have to push hard .
A : 
C :  I suggest a banana shape .
C :  Because of the fruity uh fashion .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  No m Next year that's out .
C :  Yellow and
C :  Yeah alright , yeah . Just a hunch .
B :  Well these little buttons are a bit difficult to uh draw uh
A :  Yeah .
C :  Those are the the cha the channel buttons of course ?
B :  correct .
B :  Yeah just uh the numbers .
C :  And then below is the L_C_D_ screen ?
B :  These these will be bigger in the the real design .
C :  Alright , yeah .
B :  This must be the Okay button used to uh interact with the L_C_D_ screen . And with this you can uh , yes , go to through the menus and that can
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Um the video button should be uh an apart button , because you want it to uh t , yeah , to use it fast within one uh click .
D :  You've
A :  Yes .
D :  Right .
D :  And you you need a you need a speaker .
A :  And what's the menu button ?
B :  Um it's
B :  Hmm ?
D :  For the
B :  This button can also be the Menu button , we use in the menus Well we we can add another button here , but
A :  But how did How do you get out of the menu then ? Yeah .
A :  Maybe I you could j just do an an exit with Okay . Uh
C :  Uh by pe pressing the menu button again . By pressing the menu button again , you go uh out . It's usual the the the d kind of the way it works .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yes , well but bec because when you push Menu you get in , and then you have to push Okay when you get to a choice . And
C :  Yeah ? Yeah ?
B :  Ah right . Well you you
C :  Yeah . But you can men you can press menu again to get out .
A :  Well that's also the Okay button . That's you you should have uh
B :  No no , we we we should uh add uh a extra Menu button and this the Okay button .
C :  No .
A :  Or you can put in the L_C_D_'s uh window an option Get Out .
D :  Exit .
A :  Exit .
B :  Ah once you have an extra Menu button , you don't need that that extra option . You have uh redundancy .
A :  Well , it's just a choice .
D :  But we need a we need a a recording recording button for the speech uh part . Or don't
B :  Yeah , if we decide to uh to implement that , maybe we should .
C :  Why would you put it uh then , and where is the recording uh the microphone ? Where would you put it ?
B :  Well they that could be anywhere . That's very small . It could be uh down here .
C :  Uh-huh .
B :  Um . Well , not here . I yeah I suggest here . But that's just a little gap . Yeah .
D :  Right , and spea speaker at the back , or something .
C :  Microphone , yeah .
B :  Well the speaker and the microphone , I think , are the same uh little hole thingy .
C :  Yeah I understand . Uh but uh we could uh d do , but it's perhaps more expensive , uh the speaker on the back or something .
D :  Alright .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Well i
B :  Um there are a all already being implemented in in coffee machines , so they won't be uh very expensive . But
A :  Huh ?
C :  Alright .
D :  Alright .
A :  Yeah ? Okay .
B :  This is my suggested design . Um Yes .
A :  Well , okay , alright . Um then let's have a look at the decisions we are going to have to make .
B :  And oh I think as you can see so , the L_C_D_ screen does look better uh at the lower end , or at the bottom . But
A :  I'd I agree .
D :  Yeah , fine . Move on .
A :  Fine .
C :  Well yeah yeah yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Oh , um I had some uh examples . You can uh
C :  I can live with it .
A :  Yes ?
B :  But
B :  I did not like it very much , but
B :  Well these are
A :  Too big .
B :  quite obvious , very ugly remote . Um
D :  Yeah .
C :  They do they don't look fruity enough .
D :  Nei They're n they're not trendy .
B :  No , well th
A :  They're all black .
B :  Yeah . Well not all .
A :  Hey , that one I like .
B :  Uh this is for children but th
C :  Tho Yeah those
D :  It doesn't look strong .
A :  No .
B :  No .
C :  But it doesn't uh the
B :  W but with the colours i it's a bit the way we're going to .
A :  The remote .
D :  Yeah right .
C :  Yeah , ok Yeah .
B :  Well this is a terrible
A :  Terrible .
D :  This is just crazy .
C :  But it it must not look too childish of course huh ?
A :  It's it's all too much buttons . Too many buttons . That's
B :  Um this looks Yeah . This uh these are the L_C_D_ screens . I think we should , if it's um possible , uh one with colours , but
D :  Nah th It's too expensive . Yeah .
B :  I don't know uh Too expensive ? Alright .
A :  Well , that's too expensive I think .
B :  Well Nah .
C :  But it Yeah .
A :  Alright . Yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Ha , even more . N
A :  Huh .
A :  Mm no .
D :  But are we going for a strange uh form ?
A :  'Kay .
A :  No , not very strange .
D :  'Cause people like that .
C :  Not not too strange . No .
D :  Not too strange . You can make the the underside , you can make it more round , where the L_C_D_ is .
A :  It still has t
A :  Yes . Th a a kind of bridge . So it f falls over the hand .
B :  Well
D :  I dunno if you know the No Nokia telephone , with uh the round uh thing at at the bottoms , s something like that .
A :  Yeah ? Yeah ?
A :  Yeah .
D :  You know ?
A :  Well I have at home a remote with a bridge . It's just a half round half half circle at And then it falls exactly over the hand , and that's very nice . That's It feels comfortable .
D :  Yeah , but people like something uh new you know . Yeah , different . Y yis
C :  Exotic yeah . We have t Yeah , yeah . I will design it , we design it later . So we'll get to that later I guess .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Alright . Great .
A :  Yeah , alright . Um where did I put it ? Um conceptual phase , I think this is it .
C :  The specific shape . The
A :  I got this from our friends . So Uh yeah the conceptual design .
C :  Our sources .
A :  These are a few examples which we have to decide about . All the the materials from the case , uh the electric cable that's all your uh your side of the story .
A :  Um
D :  Your bag .
A :  Yeah . Um now from the user interface , your uh package ? Um where No well , that's more like the buttons where they have to come . And um
A :  B a bit of , yeah well , a bit of uh design .
B :  Yeah , this is what we've just done . Right ?
C :  But uh we should decide now .
A :  Yes , but we have to decide about these now . And uh the trend-watching . So as you said , fruity is in , well sells good . Wow . Uh these things .
B :  Ah right .
D :  Yeah . Materials are the most , most impor
D :  Yeah .
C :  So we have to uh put it in one uh document .
A :  Uh yes . Um so if we uh go through them
C :  Copy paste uh this story into a into a Word document , and then uh put the answers after the subjects . Yeah .
B :  Not everything .
C :  Well we have to decide all these things ?
B :  Yeah but all these examples are uh of a coffee machine .
A :  Yeah well uh
C :  W we can uh override them ?
A :  Why should I uh
A :  Yeah .
A :  So
C :  Well a case ? Uh that's me . Uh I suggest Well what do I suggest actually ?
A :  What what kind of properties should it have ? Well we just listened .
C :  Uh s solid , yeah . Yeah .
B :  I think we Why don't we um use uh titanium or or a hard , yeah , some kind of metal for the uh the the whole remote except the front . That
D :  Do you know the new uh
B :  Just like um most cell phones are .
C :  Yeah , I understand . Yeah . So we have titanium .
D :  No no
D :  The front is the most important .
C :  Yeah but the non-removable elements of the of the remote , so not the front , could be titanium , to give that uh strong look . And then the front is made of plastic . And you can put that on and off , and switch it .
B :  Yeah .
A :  You know what ?
B :  Yeah .
D :  But the feel of plastic isn't strong .
C :  No but you have titanium of course . Uh you have the best of both worlds .
B :  No but you you have this Yeah .
D :  Yeah alright , alright . 'Kay .
B :  Yeah , you have the re remote in your hand like this . So you feel titanium .
C :  And of course , yeah , you have the the the plastic front end . But you also have the titanium .
D :  Yeah . Fronts are are cheaper than when they're from plas
B :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah of course , but yeah you have to make a
B :  And I don't know if you can make steel just any way you want it to .
C :  decision .
D :  Yeah , but it it's expensive .
C :  I guess so . Uh titanium I sh I think uh
B :  Yeah .
D :  Bendable . Bendable .
C :  Huh ? Well , well the
B :  Well any colour
C :  According to my sources , uh it's it's totally possible to make an entire uh uh uh Titanium is available , and uh we can uh make uh an entire remote out of it , if we want .
B :  Yeah , then you you paint it in the colour you want it . The plastic is is the colour you want it .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
D :  Paint spray .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah alright .
B :  So Yeah .
D :  So , we're going for a titanium back and a plastic front ?
A :  Alright .
A :  I've uh
C :  Yeah , I think that's a nice trade-off .
B :  Mm .
A :  Titanium back , plastic front . Okay . Um well I am going to put it in here , uh because we can uh look . I Um solid feel and trendy look . So material , um hard plastic for the front ?
D :  Yeah , great .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Alright .
C :  Yeah , for the front and then titanium for the back .
D :  Yeah .
C :  For the non-removable uh part .
D :  But then you have the problem , when you have a titanium back , you can't switch it . When you want an other colour on the front , it doesn't match . You know ?
C :  Well but
B :  Well titanium is neutral .
C :  The titan titanium isn't isn't v very Yeah , i it doesn't uh curves . No uh I nei . Titanium is very No no no , but you know b Titanium is very basic colour , and it doesn't really matter if we have a purple front on it or a orange front . I dunno if if you disagree , but I think it's doesn't matter very much .
D :  I understand . Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah .
B : 
B :  Hmm .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Alright .
B :  Well
D :  Yeah . Alright .
B :  Our customers will use those uh funky uh trendy colours , and they don't use uh wood .
D :  Funky customers . Alright .
C :  And even if it does uh doesn't match , it will uh People like mm colours that don't match .
B :  Mm . Yeah .
A :  Okay . And well the the electrical cable is just normal uh .
C :  Cop copper uh material .
C :  Excuse me ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  The electrical cable uh does
A :  It's uh from uh our coffee uh
C :  Yeah copper i just a ba basic uh
B :  No we don't use an electrical cable . Yeah inside , but this is for the coffee uh machine .
A : 
C :  Yeah in
C :  Yeah well inside the remote control we use a couple of uh
A :  Of course .
B :  Yeah , but that's not what's meant here , I think .
D :  Nei .
D :  So external .
C :  Oh external ? Well A coffee grind doesn't have Na ja . Never mind the coffee grind .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Well uh all the all the inside work of our remote is uh standard
A :  work . So
C :  Right ?
A :  The chip is normal silicon . Uh the buttons are normal , etcetera . Okay ? So that's just easy . Uh we decide about that just by looking at our competitors and our earlier uh remotes . The conceptual specification of the user interface ?
C :  Alright . Mm-hmm .
A :  Um well we have our beautiful drawing .
D :  Alright .
B :  Well I got a better one here and I will um
A :  Well you can put that in uh into the shared folder , and then I'll put it in our end report .
B :  The shared folder .
B :  I will work this out uh for the uh next meeting .
A :  Yes , you can
A :  Mm yeah . You can uh put some uh which button is what . Okay . Um the trend-watching
B :  Yeah yeah yeah .
A :  included these days . And what do we ? We thing that fruit and bright colours are
C :  Yeah the the the front w
D :  I think we can launch a couple of packages . You can buy a different kind of of of machine , but it's the same thing , but with another front . So
B :  Yeah .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Yes . We can also uh implement um we can also implement fronts from um movies that are very hot . Uh those kind of things .
B :  Yeah that's the whole idea of the front .
D :  And you can you can
C :  Yeah . Yeah .
B :  Yes . But that's for later on . The fronts y you can do anything with them .
D :  Yeah right .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah but if you if you launch uh five different packages like iPod mini
B :  Yeah , right For the uh initiative uh launch .
D :  Yeah .
C :  For the for the launch , yeah .
D :  It's good marketing .
B :  Mm .
C :  So e th then a c couple of basic colours . Not not very uh sim Not
A :  Launch different lines at once .
D :  Yeah , n not too heavy . You can always take another pick .
C :  Yeah .
A :  We should not give them the m the most lovely front
D :  They have to buy it later on . Yeah right . More basic . Yeah .
A :  when they buy it for the first time . Yeah . Come on . We still have to make those fifty million , yeah ? .
C :  Yeah .
B :  Oh yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
C :  Very boring , yeah . The most boring fronts possible .
B :  Well you can you can give them uh s s three or so , so that they can uh experiment with it and that they want more . Yeah .
A :  The most ugly .
D :  Yeah , right .
A :  Two .
C :  Yeah but you you can have some basic colours , and then we come with the special patterns on them , and and uh And uh
B :  Red red , blue and green you give them or something , and then you can give them uh other ones .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Alright .
A :  Um well the buttons etcetera , we get from Mike . Uh this fruit and bright colours , yeah well I think we'll have to in the next uh half an hour , we'll have to uh s s specify the different uh types we want to launch , when we uh well introduce our remote .
C :  Uh we still have to make We have still have to make the es the the real basic design . Because yeah we have the sketch but
D :  Yeah . But we we must remember that fancy look-and-feel is the most important thing . Else it w won't sell . So
A :  Yes .
C :  Alright , yeah .
A :  Yes . Well I'll have to , before I get another warning for five minutes , I'm going to get
A :  Where is my mouse ? Uh where is my mouse ?
D :  Lost my mouse .
A :  Oh yeah . Um this is it .
C : 
D :  Unbelievable .
A :  Well , um this we have . Uh basic stuff . Interface we have . Supplements , L_C_D_ . Maybe a a cheap voice recording .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah we should do that .
A :  Well Yes . Alright . Individual actions .
C :  The price ?
C :  We all agree on that . Yeah .
B :  Mm .
A :  Industry designer , . User Interface , Mike . You're going to work together
A :  on a prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .
B :  Yeah , we can do that .
C :  Together or uh Yeah together . How Yeah yeah , but how do I
D :  Yeah togeth
A :  That's what I got uh to hear .
B :  But bu we stay we stay here or something ?
A :  Yes well we'll get it to hear that I think . But I think so . Th they're saying SMARTboard and that's it
D :  You can take the SMARTboard .
B :  Ah right . And take it to our rooms and uh
A :  This is the SMARTboard , so
A :  Um so you can uh you you are going to make a prototype , and y Well that's includes uh specifying the buttons etcetera .
B :  Ah , specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach .
A :  Yeah . So you'll get it on your em on your laptop . Um well you will go and do something else uh on the project yeah project evaluation . So um
D :  Have fun . 'Kay .
C :  Some
C :  Some non functional tasks .
A :  , what are you going to do ? Uh I don't know what product evaluation exactly means , but uh you'll get uh the specifications .
D :  We don't have produ product yet , so kind of difficult .
A :  Yeah . That's why I uh
A :  But uh
C :  You're fired . No but
A :  How long do we still have ?
C :  Well , can we talk about something else ? Uh
A :  Yeah .
C :  Uh no I don't know anything , but maybe uh anyone else uh Yeah ?
D :  Ajax . Nah .
B :  Yeah . Um
B :  Will we use uh round buttons or square ones for the for the numbers ? Yeah I I I also uh thought Yeah .
D :  Um round . Yeah . Round .
C :  Round I think .
C :  To make it as uh as round as possible .
B :  And these uh these s these buttons uh are more uh triangle-ish shaped with a square one in the middle . Yeah . Yeah .
A :  Why does
D :  Curvy . Yeah . So you can see you have to up or down .
A :  Ah f fuck you .
C :  But now I see the
D :  And this must be uh volume I think , and this programme .
A :  Heh ?
B :  Mm .
A :  We can't get
B :  Well most of the time uh up and down is programme and left and right are volume , I think .
C :  Well th th th th th that depends uh .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , it depends , but
C :  Well we uh
B :  If you turn up the volume , you always see this thingy go up .
C :  We we j we'll just give them an uh We'll design it , and then they can give comments on it .
D :  Yeah , that's right .
B :  Yeah . Yeah alright .
D :  Yeah . Okay .
A :  Ts It doesn't work any more . We can't save them . So we'll just have them uh standing there .
D :  Yeah , I noticed .
D :  You can't uh click the corners .
A :  No . It's a bit uh bit a pity . Well we still have uh more than five minutes . Um
D :  It's a real real great thing .
A :  So what are we going to do ?
A :  I as Project Manager ha don't have a clue . Oh we can uh decide how we implement the feeling from our company into the remote .
D :  Let's start the design .
B :  Mm .
C :  Well yeah . Um I think um a logo , our company logo , and the slogan should be or could be Yeah , why not ? If there's enough space , you can put uh We'll we'll
A :  Also the slogan ? On the
B :  Uh I I'd say only the logo .
D :  Yeah . Me too .
B :  Too much text and it gets too too busy .
C :  Well , our slogan is not very long . It's just a simple What is it ?
B :  Well it's quite a long phrase .
A :  We put the fashion in electronics .
A :  We put the fashion in electronics .
D :  But we kree we keep adjusting to the fashion
C :  You c
D :  with our fronts . So
C :  But you can put it on the back , on the titanium part . The logo and the and the
D :  Yeah , right .
B :  Ah the logo should be on the top I think .
D :  The logo
A :  On the top . Yeah . Well in in in the right top corner ? And well you c On the back , you can put uh h At the bottom , you can put the logo with the
C :  Yeah they do . Well yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Right corner , yes .
C :  Right corner , or maybe here in the middle ?
B :  uh the text ? Yeah . Uh yeah , at the back ?
A :  Yeah . Just just small .
D :  But the logo the logo shouldn't be exchangeable , when you get off the front .
C :  Yeah it it should be hard on the on the on the board , and you can remove the front .
B :  Well you c Well uh Yes . You can The logo can be on on every uh front .
A :  Yeah well
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but you can scratch it off or something . It's better if you have it uh
B :  Yeah , but then you must uh really uh yeah push it in or something .
A :  Carved into the material .
A :  No , you you can carve it into the titanium at the back .
C :  I l I like the idea of the of the slogan on the on the on the thing . But am I the only one , or uh
B :  Yeah , on the backside . Well n n not not on the front side , I think . On the back Yes , you you can , yeah , push that in , so that it is always be there .
A :  Well , management would like it .
A :  The front side , no no l no slogan .
C :  No not on the front , but on the backside . Uh
A :  Sorry .
C :  I think it's a nice idea , to make it more recognisable , that the next to the logo you have the slogan .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  I agree .
C :  To make more uh of an impression .
D :  But not too big .
D :  Just uh Yeah .
C :  Not too big . No , very small . Not on the entire back , but uh just very small . But readable enough of course .
D :  Okay .
A :  Yes , slogan from
C :  But we'll uh we'll take that uh with us into the design .
B :  Yeah I think over here the logo .
C :  Lo Uh yeah . Or maybe here in the middle , but we'll decide later .
A :  on the back
A :  with logo and
A :  logo also on
A :  the front but not exchange uh
A :  Uh ? Hmm ? Uh when
D : 
A :  changing fronts .
C :  Do you do you see a bit of the of the um
A :  Alright , that's decided .
A :  Five minutes left .
C :  of the uh titanium ? O on the front ? Uh maybe if we make this this this lower part titanium , the front is the the upper part , and the the bit with the with the L_C_D_ screen . So
B :  Yes we could
A :  So a bit of titanium between ?
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah . No no betwe of between we can do but But then you have two parts of front , two fronts that
A :  That's a bit Oh that that's that's pretty cool .
B :  No , they have two fronts , that . You you can Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .
D :  No no no no . You have to make this titanium too .
A :  No ?
C :  This enti entire bottom ?
D :  Else you you get problems with the L_C_D_ . Like dust in it and so things like that . When you exchange all the fronts and it's open .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yes .
B :  Yeah .
A :  I already have uh all kinds of uh
B :  No , you can you can just And then not a straight line but uh some sort of wave or something . This is titanium . And this is uh
A :  filth between the mobile .
C :  And then the lower part is titanium ?
C :  I think that's nice , yeah .
D :  Yeah . Some some kind of wei weight in it . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Round forms .
B :  F front .
C :  Yeah .
C :  I like that bit of uh titanium also on the uh
B :  Yeah . With the with the curved edge .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yep .
C :  A bit like uh a bit like your mobile phone . Maybe you can show it . It also has the those two distinct uh
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . Tada .
C :  Mm bit like this . Uh it's uh
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , you can make it go
D :  round this corner too where the logo is . Because it has to be uh there all the time you know .
A :  What ?
C :  Yeah yeah . That uh Yeah . Maybe a nice touch , yeah .
B :  Ah .
A :  So round where ?
D :  So uh a little corner of titanium .
B :  Yeah , that's nice finishing touch you need .
A :  Oh , yeah .
A :  Yes , that also sounds uh pretty uh neat .
D :  So this this is the exchangeable part .
C :  I think I'm going to buy it .
A :  We want it . And it's only f twenty five Euros . Come on . No that's nothing .
B :  Yeah , this is the front .
B :  This is the
C :  That's a bit too much , but No , no no no , but I think uh this looks uh pretty nice actually . Of course , because it's my design but No our d our design , alright .
A :  The Phillips remote uh costs more .
D :  Right .
B :  My design .
D :  Taking all the credit .
A :  Well uh you two are going to work together . You'll get your uh specifications on your uh laptop , and then uh you uh
B :  Yeah . We'll stay here I guess ?
D :  But there's a problem . We can't uh take a blank one . Or can we ?
A :  Well I think we can , I just It's
B :  Well we can uh erase an animal I guess . Uh the fourth one .
D :  Yeah . Nah that's alright , that's alright .
C :  But don't erase my cat .
A :  Yeah , o
B :  Uh the fourth one is empty , isn't it ? Yeah .
A :  Oh
C :  I want to preserve it .
A : 
D :  This one is empty .
B :  Yeah .
D :  You have to empty one huh ?
A :  Oh , we have a one .
C :  What are you doing chief ?
A :  So , you can uh draw a Yeah .
D :  Alright .
B :  Yeah I think we have to wait ?
C :  Yeah until the until the beep goes . But I don't uh Do we have to stay here , or I think we have to return first .
D :  No
A :  Well I'll get a I'll get the message .
B : 
A :  No , I think uh Well you'll Maybe you can uh keep your uh laptop here .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Maybe .
A :  Or get your mouse . Because it's little bit uh hard to work with these uh plates .
C :  The high powers from above will have to tell us , yeah .
D :  Yeah . It's not relaxing .
A :  I always have a mouse next to my laptop . I hate these
D :  I I don't have a laptop .
C :  Yeah , touch-pads , yeah .
A :  Ugh .
C :  We can uh do a touch-pad on our remote . No just kidding . Well we have uh b you have to have a bit of humour in the in the discussions too , because it becomes too too too too stressy .
D :  Yeah right . Dream on .
B :  Yeah .
A :  And in your remote control . So we put a touch pad on it , and say ha ha . Yeah . We know you'll you'll you'll hate it but
B :  Aha . This has no function .
D :  Half
C :  But uh th youth doesn't care about functio functionality , so
D :  No .
A :  But they do want some gadgets . So that's wha what we're doing .
D :  It's all about cool things .
C :  Yeah .
D :  And it will sell .
D :  We will be rich .
C :  Bless you .
A :  Well we won't . Our bosses will be rich .
C :  Mm .
B :  We've done too much in the previous meetings .
C :  Too much ?
B :  Yes , we've got nothing to do now .
C :  Well they uh
A :  Well , that's not bad , is it ?
D :  No .
C :  I think that's good . We all had uh our talk and
C :  we agree I guess on uh several thing , on most uh on things .
A :  Mm .
B :  Its the best remote ever .
A :  So
B :  Pinball .
A :  Oh . Oh he's totally off again .
A :  Well
D :  No man . You just have to push harder .
C :  Yeah you have to push harder .
A :  But when I start here ,
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
A :  it's here . So is it
B :  Yes , but you you get really close to the screen with your hand , and I don't think that's
D :  Mm .
B :  Hmm .
D :  Recalibrate it .
A :  Nope .
C :  Where's the good old chalk board with the
D :  Yeah .
C :  the green board with the , how do you call it , chalk , yeah .
B :  We can better uh draw a design on this .
C :  Yeah , maybe .
B :  Yeah , but we can't .
C :  Maybe if i if that thing is recalibrated , we can draw a thing quick , and then before it uh
A :  Yeah .
C :  goes off again .
A :  Let's go .
B :  Well
D :  Finish meeting now .
A :  Finish the meeting now . Alright now we know what to do , so
B :  We'll stay here ?
A :  Um
D :  Yeah . Oh .
B :  Or we'll get the email .
C :  Maybe w maybe we maybe w m Can we get email here ? Huh ? Yeah . Guess so .
A :  Message ? No , get away .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Um I I'm not sure . Maybe you Yeah . Well you'll have to work on this one .
B :  Well we'll wait a few seconds and then we'll get an email .
A :  Yeah .
A :  That's a good idea .
D :  Alright . Have fun lads .
A :  Well
B :  Yeah .
C :  A happy hol happy holidays .
A :  Good luck .
A :  Okay . Well , let's start . What are we doing ? Oops .
B :  Hmm .
C :  Ah , pinball .
A :  Okay . Okay . Not doing . Uh
D :  Mm . Ah . Hey . Ah . Now I have my screen back too .
B :  Oh .
A :  Very good .
A :  Okay . we have presentations . So first , it's your turn . Yeah . Isn't it amazing .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Mine . Oh , great .
C :  Huh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Very interesting .
B :  Uh
A :  Industrial Designer . Interface concept .
B :  Yes , well uh let's uh talk about the interface uh concept .
B :  Uh , first I'll uh I'll uh discuss the buttons we just chose , uh show you some samples , uh
B :  uh discuss some colours and design maybe , already . And uh my personal preferences .
B :  Well we chose the power button to switch the television on and off . The bu uh the mute button to switch the volume on and o on and off . The channels buttons , one to nine , and uh off uh uh zero to nine , and the uh button to choose uh higher channels than nine .
B :  Uh the volume and channel quadrants , uh left and right , up and down arrows , to uh do the volume and channel . And the menu menu button to man manipulate the L_C_D_ uh display .
B :  Um , I found some uh interesting uh uh samples . Examples . Um , well uh what's pretty standard is uh that it's that they're all pretty uh uh high uh
D :  Large . A lot a lot of buttons buttons .
B :  Yeah . Yeah . Large and and and pretty thin and uh and long . Um , power buttons are mostly at the top
B :  uh left or right .
B :  Um , well we see the the the same uh
B :  arrows . Like there . And uh
B :  Yeah , well arrow b buttons can be blue .
B :  And what's interesting is the the the icons on the buttons . Some buttons have icons like the play and stop , but we don't use that . But uh , these we we have to choose the right icons , or or letters . Uh this is the V_ for volume , but they're both uh a V_ . So it's it's not really very uh clear what's the function of that .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Um
B :  Yeah . So , that's
A :  Can you go back one page ?
A :  For the uh menu , what do we use for that ?
B :  Uh , well
A :  We don't have buttons for the menu . Or we may have to use channel of the volume and channel .
B :  Yeah . I thought that was our uh idea . So , uh how
A :  Okay . But uh
A :  You have to put it on the
B :  Like this . Or or this .
A :  Yeah .
B :  And that the menu button is okay .
A :  Yeah but , has to be clear that you can use the arrows .
B :  Yeah , okay . Uh , so the
D :  Yes .
B :  The icons on the arrows , as well , you mean .
A :  Mm-hmm . Yes . The second one .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Uh , well that's something to uh think about .
A :  Okay .
C :  Uh , maybe I'll have something in my uh presentation . And you will see it .
B :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
B :  Um , well I don't I don't know if we have to discuss this already , or in the next uh meeting . But uh , as we have to uh to to design the the case and the whole uh remote control in our uh our our corporate uh company uh uh colours and the logo , I would uh recommend a yellow case .
B :  Uh , round edges . The logo at the bottom . And uh , well maybe each each uh set of buttons uh has uh has his own colour . So , it's good . Uh , recognisable . K so , I think .
A :  Not too much colours .
B :  Uh , no . Not too much . But uh No , no , no . But this has to be has to be trendy and uh and
A :  No , it's not flower power .
A :  S okay .
B :  Uh , yeah so good uh good icons on the buttons , and uh and big buttons is my uh personal uh
B :  opinion .
A :  Okay .
B :  That was that .
A :  Thank you .
A :  So , you're next .
C :  I'm next , okay .
C :  Yes . No . Here we go .
C :  Uh , at first we will uh I will f uh say something about what younger people want , our uh group w uh w uh we want to uh sell our remote controls to . And then , I'll discuss what my opinion is about the costs , about uh what battery is in it , what kind of buttons also .
A : 
D :  Okay .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  First uh , the younger people , they want like soft mat uh materials and primary colours . Like , totally yellow , totally red . Uh , so it's visible . Uh , the shapes are curved and round , like uh you also said .
C :  Maybe it's nice to uh get a remote control not like all the other ones , straight and uh flat and long . But to give him the shape of your hand , so you it's easier to use or something like that . But that's just an idea . And then ,
C :  I'll have to discuss about the costs uh of all the things for the remote control . The battery , there are few options . Uh , I think the best option is to use uh the basic battery . So , everybody can buy it uh at the at the supermarket .
C :  Or use uh a k uh kinetic battery like uh within a watch . When you uh shake it a few times , it it's loaded . Uh , the the form of the remote control , I think it's also nice have it curved .
C :  And maybe like it's hand-shaped . Uh , so uh you take it here in your hand and here are the buttons . Uh material , you use plastic . Hard plastic uh because uh it won't have to burst uh like in the in one time . And also rubber because the younger people like that , what we see in the research .
C :  Uh the push-buttons . We have one new thing uh discovered . It's a scroll push uh thing like a mouse . Maybe it's uh easy to use uh for the channels . When you want to go m move up , you just scroll up and click on the button , if you wanna see the next , uh if you wanna see that channel .
C :  And also for the mouse , uh for the volume , it's also uh easy to use . Just scroll a bit up , scroll a bit down . And that's also easy just w when you have a thing like this , and you get it here . You can do it with your thumb .
C :  And with your l left hand you can uh push the buttons uh if you push uh channel one , you can see channel one .
D :  Hmm .
C :  The electrics um with a scroll push uh button , we must use regular uh chips . There are also uh simple chips . They are uh cheaper . Um , but then we have just a basic uh uh remote control , and I think there are a lot of those uh things , and people won't buy it any more . They have seen enough of it .
C :  And you have also advanced um chips . But that's with the L_C_D_ uh screen . And the costs will increase a lot more . And I think our budget is too low to use and an L_C_D_ , and the chip who is more expensive .
C :  And maybe it's also then uh thoughtful if we u uh use uh as um different kind of uh shapes for the for remote control , that we then use the primary colours . Like , you get a yellow uh remote control , red one , blue one , et cetera .
C :  You have any more questions about this ?
C :  I think the main thing is we look at the costs . And not too basic , not a basic remote control , who everybody already has .
D :  Yep .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
D :  But , thi i uh This is with an L_C_D_ ? No , not .
C :  Not with an L_C_D_ . No .
A :  No , isn't . But the L_C_D_ is easy when you use the scroll uh buttons .
A :  Then you can scroll , you see what number , and then you push .
C :  Yeah .
C :  But then , what I say , the costs will uh get a lot higher .
A :  But then it's not easy to use scroll uh
A :  wheel .
C :  Th then you'll see it on the television .
A :  If you don't
A :  Hmm , yes . But then . Yeah , then you go one down one up .
A :  When you scroll .
C :  Yeah but l when you see a menu uh on the television , it's like you see uh one to twenty , you go uh uh s scroll up , and push number tw twenty .
A :  Yeah but like we said before , it has to be used on every television . So you may not be uh
A :  No . The television must do that . So
C :  Mm-hmm . Yeah , I think the younger people will have newer televisions , which
C :  can provide our uh remote control .
A :  Yeah but young people have to have all their uh room .
A :  And mostly they are smaller . So
C :  Yes .
C :  But that won't be a problem .
C :  I think .
A :  Most the times that are not advanced televisions .
C :  No , but then we'll get to the regular uh remote controls . And I think , what I said , everybody has them uh has them already . And they go to a uh supermarket and buy them uh for two Euros . Uh , and ge and get the most cheapest uh thing . And I think we must look further to uh to devel d develop something news .
A :  Okay .
D :  Uh , can you give an indication in b uh in the cost difference between uh the chip with L_C_D_ or without ?
C :  I got it on my screen and it was uh higher . But I don't know uh how much higher .
D :  'Cause it I think if we have an L_C_D_ , it will also sell a lot better .
A :  That's important .
C :  That's true .
D :  And that might uh bring back the costs uh
C :  But then we'll I think we must discuss who uh what will be better . If we have a better shape of the um remote control , or better options on it . With a scroll menu , a w scroll thing , and a L_C_D_ . And then a flat um remote control . Or , a more hand-shaped remote control , with scroll , without L_C_D_ .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Maybe you can look how how much it is for the L_C_D_ . It's very important .
C :  I can uh look on my uh
C :  Uh
C :  Note that the push-button requires a simple chip chip . A scroll wheel requires minimally a regular chip , which is a higher price range . The display requires a advanced chip , which is which in turn is more expensive than the regular chip .
A :  Yeah , more expensive . But how much ?
C :  Doesn't say .
A :  Oh .
D :  Huh .
B :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
C :  That's from my manufacturing division .
A :  Okay . Well , thank you . Next .
D :  'Kay .
D :  My turn ?
C :  Yes ?
D :  Mm . So
D :  So
D :  Yeah . So , my uh presentation is about trend-watching . Uh , I did some trend-watching . It's very important to uh keep up with latest trends . 'Cause if you don't , you won't sell .
D :  So , well how we did do that ? Uh , well we made an investigation of the market , by Trendwatchers . They uh watch in uh cities like uh Paris and Milan . Of course , well known for their uh trend uh trends .
D :  And well , uh what did you find ? Uh , we have two groups , young and trendy , and the old and rich . Well th and the young and trendy , they uh they starting to like uh fruit and vegetables uh as a theme for n uh clothes , shoes , and also uh products .
D :  And um , material ? That should feel have uh a spongy feeling . And to get a feeling for what it is , uh here is an image of it .
D :  Then the old and rich . They like uh dark colours , and simple , recognisable shapes . And um , they also like uh familiar material , uh especially wood . Now , another picture .
D :  To get a feeling for this .
D :  Well , uh then already come to my personal preferences . We uh aim at the younger market . So , we should also be uh look at their uh trends . However , with trends it's always if there's it's now . It it it might last one year , and next year it be uh can be totally different .
D :  And I think we want to sell our product for longer than one year . So , we m must not just only look at what the trend is now , as it might be totally different next year . So , that's uh one thing to keep in mind .
C :  Changing covers .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Any questions ?
C :  Nope .
B :  No .
A :  No . It's clear .
A :  So now ,
A :  it's uh Ah , let's see .
A :  Now , w we have to decide
A :  Well , we have to decide on the concept . So , we have to look at
A :  'S next . Components and user interface concept . So
A :  Now , we have to make some concept . Maybe one of you can paint it on the board .
A :  First , uh user interface .
C :  Uh , uh-uh .
C :  How w how we how we make it ? Uh
A :  Yes , a concept on uh Just
C :  Shouldn't we first discuss about like what w we all
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but maybe we can paint it . Uh , what do we want ?
C :  Yeah , but if I paint with
A :  I'll paint . Okay . Well
D :  Mm .
A :  Something like this ? Or
B :  Mm , yes .
A :  Shapes or What do we need ?
D :  Can make several uh concepts .
B :  What ?
A :  Yes , okay .
D :  We have this , and we had the idea of an um a more uh uh uh like sh in the shape of your hand .
A :  Okay .
C :  More like something
D :  Yeah I I I uh yes .
C :  M like Yeah I can't dr I can't draw it . Uh I have to . I'm not a designer . It's more three D_ . Like , um when you have
A :  And you have to .
A :  Yeah .
C :  a part here . This is the remote control . And then you have something like
C :  th this under it . So , it's easier to get it like this . It's like a gun .
B :  Mm .
B :  Yeah .
A : 
D :  Yeah .
D :  A g Mm . .
A :  So , it has to be soft ?
C :  And it has to be soft , yeah .
A :  Okay .
C :  So , you can squeeze in it and Sorry ? Buttons on top of it . And here .
A :  And uh , the buttons ?
A :  Buttons .
C :  The scrolling . You can do it with your thumb .
A :  No , it won't .
B :  But but i that's the only scroll uh button on it then ?
C :  But now we use one scroll button and the other one is here . One till uh uh zero till nine . And the b
B :  Yeah , okay . But but how
A :  But , well there one for the sound and one for the channels .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah . How
C :  Yeah ? Or two buttons .
B :  Okay .
D :  And i if we go to uh
A :  Uh , two scroll uh wheels .
C :  If uh 'Kay c If we do If we use one , then we'll have just a switch on it , and you'll just switch it , and now it's the sound to switch back
B :  Mm .
A :  That's th that's more difficult .
D :  But if we have uh a me Yeah . If we have a menu , uh how do we uh choose other options ?
A :  It's better in
C :  with the menu uh button . And then you also can scroll uh scroll in it . Just not like all the other ones , with uh this thing , and uh here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow , here an arrow . Because uh , from h hundred uh remote controls , ninety nine have it .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  But if we don't have a L_C_D_ we don't have a menu .
C :  Uh , then we have it on the T_V_ , the menu .
D :  Uh-uh .
A :  Yeah , but again maybe th How do we know the T_V_ can handle it ? You don't know . So , there's no menu .
C :  I don't know .
C :  It's like some sort of uh teletext option , but we don't have teletext .
A :  No . So you can't use it .
C :  And if we put an L_C_D_ thing on it , then the costs will uh be much higher .
A :  Okay , we make two concepts . One with L_C_D_ . One without L_C_D_ .
C :  'Kay .
C :  But you all like this kind of thing . Uh
A :  Good concept . But
C :  With the scroll button . And and this one has to be soft . And this has to be harder , because when it falls , it mu mu must not burst . Or some kind of rubber around it .
A :  That's one .
D :  Uh-uh .
B :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It's one .
A :  Two . Number two .
B :  And you can and you can uh make the the power button as a trigger . Like uh
C :  Yeah . Yeah . Ah that's nice . Here . Trigger .
B : 
A :  No . But when you handle it , you put it on and off .
B :  Just to uh
A :  It's not good to use .
B :  Oh , like a
A :  Yeah , but I'll zap . Fuck . Out .
B :  Yeah .
A :  No , it's not good . Now , second concept . One with L_C_D_ , one without L_C_D_ .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Then uh
A :  Paint it .
C :  Paint it ? With the scroll thing on , like this ?
A :  One with two scroll buttons and one with without . Yeah .
A :  Uh , one with a with a menu , and one without a menu . And the one with with a menu has an L_C_D_ .
C :  So ?
C :  Draw it .
A :  Unbelievable . Do I have to do everything . Blank . You have
A :  Not so difficult .
D :  Yeah .
B :  But if you put push the the menu button
A :  Uh , that's the menu . There for the L_C_D_ screen .
B :  Yeah , wh what
B :  Yes , but you don't know which of the scroll buttons you have to choose .
A :  You have to
A :  For the menu .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Mm-hmm . One
A :  that way . And one
A :  that way .
A :  So
A :  Then it depends on the cost . S On and off .
C :  But is it easy to use ? When you have it on your left side , and
A :  When it's not too big . Just like a a phone .
B :  Mm-hmm .
D :  M uh yeah , maybe it's better if the uh scroll-wheels are um more separate , yeah . Like , you have the menu button in between uh
C :  Separate , more separate , h yeah .
A :  Yes , okay .
C :  Yeah . On the left a scroll button , and on the right a scroll button .
C :  But would it be easy to use then ? If it's like you have a big uh
A :  Very good .
A :  Is it better ?
A :  When you uh the menu , you have to go there there there there .
C :  I also think this concept is not what the young people were looking for . They were like round curves , uh different uh
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , okay . That's that's the outside . But now the First the buttons .
C :  Okay , okay , okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Think we have we have now two buttons missing . The uh um
D :  The mute button .
A :  Sorry ?
D :  We have two buttons missing . The mute button . And um , the to to uh have to uh numbers
A :  Mute . And the other .
D :  Okay . But , uh
A :  Yeah . Not so difficult .
C :  Personally , I think two scroll buttons uh aren't easy to handle .
A :  But how do you wanna solve it ?
C :  With the switch button .
A :  Yeah but on the menu that's not uh easy .
C :  No like uh
A :  Then you go down , you switch , you go into the right , you switch , you go down .
C :  Oh , you mean like that . Uh , then you can also have like uh th um
A :  Yeah .
A :  A joystick .
C :  Yeah , and joystick , I think .
A :  Yeah . But is it uh
A :  Does that break , a joystick ? Or a small one just like in a laptop .
C :  Yeah like in a laptop , s uh s some sort of thing . A little bit bigger , with easier thi
A :  Mean , it's better . But how expensive it is ?
C :  I don't know .
A :  Oh . Why do I pay you for ?
A :  Um , well um
A :  Better ideas .
D :  Okay .
C :  Or no scroll uh things . Just a shape . And No , no . It won't work .
A :  For the young peoples I think scroll button's good .
C :  Yeah . Uh-huh .
A :  So
A :  Think we have to keep them .
C :  Or a remote control more like joystick .
A :  Yeah , but is it That's not expensive than uh Joystick is better .
A :  A small one .
C :  A small one like this , like a Nintendo uh k
A :  No just like in a
C :  Playstation thing .
A :  a laptop . Small , round .
A :  Then it's
A :  not so big .
C :  No , no , no . I mean the the shape of the remote control . Just like a Playstation thing .
A :  Oh the sh Yeah , but then you can You have to use t with one hand .
C :  Yeah .
A :  So
A :  Maybe , if it's possible , it's not too expensive , I think a joystick is better . A small one .
A :  So , please look at it .
C :  No , that's okay , I got
D :  And on the L_C_D_ , how much it costs ? Uh , it costs extra ?
C :  Uh they're not uh
C :  in details . It's more expensive or less expensive , huh ?
A :  Yeah we I think you get it .
A :  So , after this meeting you have half an hour to uh fix it .
C :  Then I have to come with it .
A :  Yes .
C :  I got my personal costs . I I don't I don't know the costs .
A :  Your problem . Not mine .
C :  Then I'll uh make something up .
A :  Okay . So , do we have other concepts ?
A :  Then for the components ,
A :  we use a normal battery .
B :  Mm , yeah .
A :  Then it's
A :  Ch cheapest way , I think .
C :  Yeah , or the or the kinetic uh with normal battery . Yeah , I think it's uh , yeah , more expensive . Yeah .
A :  No , no kinetic . Kinetic is uh ch makes it more expensive . So we use a normal battery .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Yes .
C :  Okay .
A :  Chip . Depends on the L_C_D_ .
C :  Depends on the scroll .
A :  Scroll .
C :  If we use a scroll , then we have the uh regular chip . If we don't use a scroll , then we can use the simple chip . And that's
A :  Yeah . And uh , we If you use the L_C_D_ , we have to
C :  Uh the most expensive . Yeah .
A :  Yes , okay . So , depends on the L_C_D_ and the scroll . Okay .
C :  If we Yeah . If we No okay scroll-wheel . So , I have this . So , it will be uh the advanced chip , or the uh regu uh or the regular chip .
A :  Okay . So , uh the shapes of the
A :  depends on the L_C_D_ and But ,
A :  it has to be small .
A :  I think .
C :  Or shall we just put it on the pistol thing ? And then just put also on L_C_D_ on it ?
A :  If you have pistol , it L_C_D_'s not easy .
A :  Y y Yeah but
C :  Just use your thumb .
A :  If you use a phone .
C :  If you Yeah . I use my thumb .
A :  k Yeah , but but then you have it . Like , th if you have pistol , you have it so . And the screen is
C :  Yeah .
C :  If you have a joystick on
A :  Well , then you have to keep it this way to look at the screen .
C :  No , if you have like uh an uh uh a ni a uh Playstation uh game controller . And you move up , f forward , down , left . Then you have uh just , yeah , a little bit curved . It's not just uh straight .
A :  Yeah .
A :  No . No , no .
C :  That's how we use it . That's why they make joysticks like that , I think .
D :  Uh
A :  Yeah , but then you look forward . And then you can y
D :  Uh , yeah , but
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah ?
A :  N well , if you have to look at it .
D :  If you
C :  'Kay . Here's our designer .
D :  If we have uh then something standing here , with the L_C_D_ .
C :  Yeah .
A :  Then it goes like this .
C :  Yeah , why not .
A :  If th n well
C :  It's for the younger people . It's something new .
A :  Yes , of course . That's good good . But the um , it may not break .
B :  It's uh
C :  Now we put uh rubber around it .
A :  Okay . If that's possible .
D :  Um , Yeah .
C :  Hard plastic , uh the shape , and around it hard uh around it rubber . And the uh the hand shape is also rubber .
A :  Okay .
B :  Or you can uh
D :  I can't see the .
B :  turn it inside .
D :  But , uh the easy of uh , th the ease of use wasn't uh the most important uh aspect of it .
B :  But that's
C :  Huh .
B :  No , that's true .
D :  Uh , for us it's about to sell it . Uh
A :  Yeah of course . Okay .
C :  This is something new .
A :  Then this is the design . And the buttons are on the next page . So , depends on the cost . So , um we have one minute .
C :  Costs are okay .
B :  .
D :  One .
A :  I think . No . More . Seven .
D :  No . You have more . You have still ten .
A :  Next meeting . Thirty minutes . So hurry up .
C :  Oh , that's us together .
A :  You two stay here . Paint it .
B :  Okay .
A :  Now you have to .
A :  So
A :  I think it's clear . Check your mail . So
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
A :  It has to be ready in the next meeting . So
D :  What ?
B :  Cookie .
D :  Okay .
A :  Next meeting is called the detailed design . So
A :  Everyth everything has to be ready .
D :  Okay .
A :  Thanks for your attention .
C :  'Kay .
D :  See you at the next meeting .
C :  Bye bye .
A :  Do you need to change anything on it ? Because otherwise I will already open it .
D :  Um
D :  Mm , don't think so .
A :  Okay .
D :  Unless uh things have suddenly change again .
A :  Is it much changes ?
D :  Uh don't know . Maybe uh you've got new information , like uh last time .
A :  Uh I didn't No no . I do hot have
A :  Only the same information .
D :  Okay .
A :  Hello , Sebastian .
C :  Hello hello Mister P_M_ .
A :  I believe uh Miss uh Tentel is with us as well , in the control room .
C :  Well , that's where the thinking goes on .
A :  Oh , it's that Roo again , always late . Bongiorno .
B :  Bongiorno .
C :  I think you should punish him . You're the P_M_ .
A :  Hmm .
B :  Punish .
A :  I see some interesting okay .
C :  Possibilities , yeah ?
B :  You wish .
A :  People , welcome back .
B :  Welcome . Uh
A :  The third meeting . Um I have some points I would like to uh some some issues I would like to point out . Um first of all , um if you make minutes yourself as well , uh like Sebastian does , um could you put them on the shared folder ?
D :  Oop .
A :  If you do not make minutes , no problem , but it's easy for me to see what you uh wrote down , so I could uh can uh um use that in the in the report . Um the second thing , um
B :  Yeah .
A :  I was th uh s thinking to myself , I have this little remote control , and I'm talking to it , but I still need to point to the television , because it works with infrared .
A :  That's quite strange .
C :  Yes .
A :  Okay . We'll come to that later , I g I think . Um the agenda for now uh uh are there any pre-discussion questions ?
C :  So
B :  No .
C :  Not at all .
D :  No .
A :  Okay . Um we wi we will have your individual presentations , uh then the decision on the remote control concept , um and uh the closing . Forty minutes in total for this . So um I think we we can immedis immediately start with the individual presentations , um the progress you've made . Um I think it might be smart to look at uh Ruud's um information first , because I understood there are some uh significant changes in the market situation .
C :  Okay .
D :  'Kay .
D :  Hmm ?
B :  Alright .
D :  Oh .
D :  .
C :  Just press the okay button , it works .
D :  Yeah ,
D :  Okay .
A :  Um yeah .
D :  Yeah . Yeah .
D :  My method ?
C :  How surprising .
D :  Well , findings . Uh
D :  Ease of use is important , but uh innovation is more important , and a fancy look and feel is uh even more important . And uh some fashion watchers have found out that the young target group likes fruit and vegetables
D :  in their uh clothes , shoes and furniture , and that they want spongy material .
D :  Probably watch too much Sponge Bob .
D :  Uh the older group uh still prefers dark colours . Simple shapes uh m material . But we since we are concentrating on uh
D :  the younger group
A :  Uh w wait a sec wait a se uh could you go to the previous slide ? Um because I'm taking minutes and it
C :  Oh wait uh wait up .
D :  'Kay .
A :  Um were the important themes enclose . Yeah okay . The feel of to be spongy
C :  Uh so do you think um when fruit and vegetables are important for clothing and shoes that they are in remote controls also ?
D :  Well , uh one example given was this , so um I assume they just want something colourful . Not uh specifically uh an apple as a remote control or something .
C :  Not something dull .
C :  Okay .
B :  But they like dark colours , you said in the p
D :  No , uh the younger group likes uh more colourful
B :  Okay .
D :  objects . But
B :  Well then I suggest that the corporate colours are grey and yellow . I had
C :  But can you can you go back to that slide ? The uh just one slide back , no no no .
D :  Which one ? This ?
C :  Yes .
C :  Okay , and the feel of the material has to be spongy .
D :  Yes .
C :  Has it something to do with that uh natural feeling also , do you think ?
D :  Uh well , it might . But personally I wouldn't like a sponge as a remote control . But
D :  Maybe soft material or something . But not a real sponge .
A :  Okay , so so , yeah , it might not be t uh it it shouldn't be too hard . It it maybe it rubber or or yeah . Okay .
D :  Yeah , exactly .
D :  Yeah , and like uh the older group likes familiar materials , but that doesn't mean we should use wood ,
B :  Or we could make oh .
D :  So
C :  Okay .
D :  Well , this this is an example of what they would like . But since we're conten concentrating on uh the younger group ,
D :  I think we should use soft materials
D :  and uh make it colourful or uh like cell phones , exch exchangeable covers .
A :  Yeah .
D :  So we could provide
D :  both for the young and the old what they like .
A :  Well , that's interesting .
C :  It's quite interesting .
A :  You could make a few v very colourful ones , and uh a very traditional co cover .
B :  Yeah , o o
C :  Yes .
B :  I'm thinking about uh the Bananarama telephone uh telephone from uh Siemens . The yellow uh rubber telephone . It's the it's the rubber uh
A :  Yeah , yeah .
A :  Yeah , it is , it is i yeah .
B :  cover . And it's uh colourful . It looks likes a banana . We have the fruit , we have the colours . We have the simple design .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Do you know the phone ?
C :  I don't know the phone , but I can imagine it .
A :  It's the Siemens uh C_ twenty five , I believe it's it's the one the Post-bank uh gave away , the very
B :  Um thirty five .
C :  Oh , that one , yes . Now I kn uh oh , I know , I know .
B :  And the b the light blue and it's also in yellow .
C :  Yes , I I've seen it . I've seen it .
A :  You kn you know , Ruud , as well ? About th
D :  I've seen it , but
A :  Okay . Okay . Um uh okay . Do you have uh thit that was Okay . Okay , so the the m uh important findings are uh innovation is more important than ease of use for the our target group . And um colouring is important and and uh soft materials . Okay .
D :  'Kay . Uh that's about it .
D :  Yes .
D :  Uh soft material .
C :  So So ease of use is important , but technology is twice as important . And what was even more important ?
D :  Uh the fancy look and feel .
C :  Okay . So that's the most important thing for our customers .
D :  Yes . Apparently .
A :  Okay , Roo ,
B :  Yeah .
A :  could you do your presentation ?
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Well , I don't ha really have much to add , um because most of things we already said in uh
B :  the previous uh discussion .
B :  Um
A :  Okay , well it's good to to sum up uh the things we already thought about .
B :  Uh the previous ideas were voice recognition and uh the round button for uh the p channel programming and uh volume . Well , a few interface I uh I found on the internet are are these . These are both with uh with voice recognition , but they're very advanced and very high-tech and just um , well , a weird um
A :  Shape .
B :  shape . So I suggest I couldn't uh I had a small uh mock-up uh sign on the on paper . But it didn't work . My pen didn't load um the information . So I made a really simple f uh a shape on uh in um
B :  PowerPoint . But we could make uh a round uh an oval uh um remote control . Uh yellow .
C :  Mm-hmm . But it's it's kind of uh it's kind of o organic , so that's very good .
A :  Yeah . And what I'm thinking about , maybe um we should make very light but um uh a grip um I mean this is how you hold a remote control . Um it shouldn't be too uh glatt , too slippery , s because um
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes .
C :  Slippery .
B :  But if you have something like uh the Siemens phone , it's rubber . So it's easy in your hand Uh indeed .
C :  You have to grab it .
A :  Yeah . Yeah , exactly .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Yes . There are there are also remote controls who have uh a little shape underneath where you can put your fingers in , so you can get a really good grip on it . So you you don't have to um attain much pressure to it . It's it's a lot easier . So m
A :  Yeah , ex for your fingers , yeah .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah . It grips automatically . Yeah , okay .
C :  Yes . But I'll I'll go into that deeper in my presentation .
A :  Okay , good .
B :  Great .
B :  Oh and um to add on um Ruud's information , in this um interface we can have uh high-tech with the voice recognition and uh , well , the the fancy colours and uh and so on , and still have the ease of use , because we have an easy interface . And all the other remote controls are high-tech in buttons and uh and so on . Yeah .
A :  Yeah . Way too much I think for our goal , yeah .
B :  So if you have the voice recognition , you can you can programme like thirty uh um
A :  Okay , b but I think we'll yeah .
B :  thirty c uh controls on it .
C :  Okay , but I'll I'll go into that , because there are are some possibilities and some impossibilities . Um I had a talk with uh our manufacturing uh division , and uh we had a talk about all the different components um who are in this design . Uh these are the things we've looked at . And of course I used the web to uh find my information . About the casing , we have three different casing possibilities . We have the uncurved or flat case . Uh that's the most common uh remote con control form uh we're used to is just a it ju it's just a box . I'm sorry I I don't have any pictures of uh of this thing .
C :  We have uh a curved one . It's uh curved in two dimensions . You have to imagine it's a bit like a wave form . So it's uh a little more advanced in its in its shape . Uh and we have an even more advanced uh shape , which is curved in three dimension . I c I think you can compare it a little bit with the uh big grey image uh you had in your presentation . The the big remote control , something like that . But it's quite uh advanced and it's
A :  Okay .
B :  Yeah .
B :  Right .
C :  it's quite daring to to use I think . Um for these casings we have uh different types of finishing . We can use plastic , which is uh very slippery and maybe not so nice , but you can give it any colour , uh which is the same for rubber , but it's not slippery . We can use wood and titanium . Well , um we cannot use the titanium on the double curve cases . And these latex cases , there's there's just the plastic ones uh won't allow the use of solar cells as an energy source source . Which brings me to the different energy sources . Um well , we even seem to have uh hand dyn dynamos for uh powering our uh remote controls . You really have to imagine like winding up your uh I d
B :  Great .
A :  Well , it would be very new to the market , but
C :  It would be very new , but it's a kind of a retro uh style , I think . Uh Well , this is quite interesting . Uh there's there's also a kinetic energy supply . So um when you're watching T_V_ uh or when you're you you have to um make some kind of energy kinetic energy by shaking the remote or throwing it against the wall , whatever you wish . It have it it has to move , that's the the sense of it . And you can store the energy in the in the thing .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Like the watch .
A :  I think um , if if I can hook on to that , um the kinetic thing is very funny . I mean solar is of course it's nice , but it's , well , your uh your calculator has a solar panel . Um hand dynamo
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  It's very funny indeed .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Indeed .
B :  But if you're watching a movie , how many times uh you take the the remote control and and if uh if you have a watch , you have the kinetic uh idea in a watch also . You you walk and uh but uh you you're sitting on a couch .
A :  Well , maybe m
A :  Yeah , I know .
C :  Mm-hmm . Yes . But you know you know from your own watch your watch uses uh a minimal con it consumes a minimal amount of energy . the the shaking of your body , which is almost uh every activity makes your uh body shake , uh it charges it . But uh the problem here is that it it supplies a a very little amount of kinetic energy . So I think uh you have a problem when you're watching a movie and uh you haven't moved the remote uh i remote control in a in an amount of time , and you want t to switch uh the channel or something , well , m it might not work . So that's something you have to keep in mind .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  And wha
A :  Okay .
C :  So , but maybe maybe there's a possibility com to combine it with m uh traditional batteries , so we can save on the batteries and um when there's enough kinet kinetic energy , use the kinetic energy , and otherwise use the batteries .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , because I guess the voice recognition feature u consumes quite a f uh a lot of power . Yeah .
C :  Uh yes , it does . I'll come to that later . And we of course have the traditional uh solar power , which is just uh uh uh uh uh a piece of material on the remote control which transfers light energy into electricity . The user interface controls , um of course we have the push-buttons and uh we also have scroll-wheels . And these scroll-wheels can also be integrated with buttons . So it's just like a mouse . You can scroll 'em , you can also push it .
A :  Okay .
C :  Um uh in the indicators we have the L_C_D_ displays , which means uh you can watch uh in a display w which channel you have chosen or something like that of the li amount of volume which is uh currently uh and we also have double scroll-buttons , which are just two of these things . So we don't really have the the kind of button we had in mind in our uh uh in our last meeting , the the thing with the the round with the four
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Oh , we can just make four push-buttons in a form of a round .
C :  Yes . That is possible too . Yes .
B : 
B :  But I th I don't think uh the scroll-wheels I had some I had some information about it too . I don't think there's any possibility for us to use scroll-wheels . I d I can't see uh any uh scenario where you would use a scroll-wheel with a button on it .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Well
C :  Well , mayb uh well , m me neither . Maybe when you integrate some functions .
A :  This will be the remote , right ? Um with uh maybe a channel selector .
B :  Yeah .
A :  What about
A :  integrating a scroll-bar on this side ?
B :  Yeah , uh that's a possibility , but
C :  Uh it's do it's done before . Yes . It's quite quite good , yes .
A :  Because this is how you keep it
B :  But Flores ,
B :  think about a scenario where y where you would use the scroll-button for
A :  Volume ?
C :  Well , it's it well , i what he means is there's an button integrated in the scroll-wheel . There's no scenario where you use uh the button in the scroll-wheel . You just use the wheel .
B :  A volume , okay .
A :  Well , what about mute ?
C :  About mute . Well , yes .
A :  Thi i i m I guess uh th this is my volume button . And I can either on this side or this side um
C :  Okay .
C :  Yes .
C :  Well , okay . Well , that that that's one possibility , okay .
A :  And click it to muten the device .
C :  Well , okay . It's quite goods .
A :  And and it makes it different from the traditional uh devices on this market . So I'm looking for a way to
A :  uh make it a little different than the traditional ones . So maybe um I guess that that's something you two uh need to think about . Uh Ruud , wha what do you thing about uh a scroll-bar ? Uh scroll-wheel .
C :  Mm-hmm . Yes .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Um
B :  Wheel .
D :  Uh well , it's obvious obviously new . So it might attract uh the young customers .
C :  Hmm . But it's done before , uh there are many other devices um like uh telephones and our uh radio , pocket radios . We use this . And
A :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Well , it's it's been done years ago and I don't see it anywhere now . So maybe it's not no
A :  Well , all the Sony telephones use it , for example , for volume . Nokia has a well , okay , it's not really a scroll-wheel , but on their side th the the volume button is on the side , because you gri grab it like this .
C :  .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Yes , but it uses two separate buttons .
A :  Yeah . I know , it's not really a scroll-wheel . No . Yeah .
C :  It doesn't use a . Well . Uh something for uh Roo here .
A :  For you too , yeah .
B :  Yeah , I believe uh if you have uh what we've earlier said , um the grip uh places in in the remote control . You have your hand on one place on the remote control , so you have to place all the buttons in a range of your thumb . So in that case uh the volume button on the side uh of the remote control would be perfect .
C :  Wi within reach . Yes , you have to .
C :  Yes .
C :  yes .
C :  Yeah , yeah . Okay . Okay , um we have to know , if you want to use uh these rubber double-curved c uh case , um you must use these push uh push-buttons . There's no way you can integrate L_C_D_ displays . There's no way you can integrate scroll-wheels , because it's all curved . There's there are no uh flat areas where you can incorporate these things . So that's a limitation .
A :  Okay . Sebastian . Um
A :  Yeah .
C :  About um the components , uh just the hardware . We basically have uh three types of chips we can use and uh these chips incorporate all the Logica and um um uh hardware that is needed to send uh to send a signal . Uh we have a simple , regular and advanced chip . And there is something like a sample sensor and sample speaker , which is a little cryptic uh to me . But I think that's the the voice recognition thing that we are uh thinking about .
B :  Yeah yeah , you can um I have some information about it . Uh in the voice recognition you say a word you can programme words like uh v uh volume up . Of mute , let's say mute . Um you programme it , you m mute and you g you give um an uh an action to it that that's really the mute function and uh when you speak in the the remote control , it repeats uh your saying . So that's the sample sensor . So if you say mute , it says mute again , and then it's um well , I believe it's uh
C :  Mm-hmm . Okay .
C :  Okay . So so okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  It performs the action . Yeah .
B :  Yeah , and then uh he he repeats its action what which he believes it is . So you say mute , he repeats mute and you makes a computer sound mute , and then goes to the mute function .
C :  Okay .
A :  Yeah .
C :  Okay . Okay , so that's basically the the voice recognition item we were searching for . Okay . This sample sensor uh requires an regular chip , I thought . Um no op I'm not very sure . No , it's not in here . If we want to use the L_C_D_ display , we really need the advanced version , which is a bit l little bit more costly . If we want to use the scroll-wheels we need the regular version . And if we don't want to use uh any of these uh more advanced functions we can keep with the simple uh chip , which is a bit cheaper .
A :  Okay . Uh well uh d did we already decide on the display ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Um no , but I think that's something for uh Roo here
A :  To
B :  Yeah . Well , I don't have um I haven't looked for uh for information about it , but I don't think information uh y I don't think you need it on a display . Especially when when we have to look at a cost , I don't think uh 'cause uh uh all any T_V_ can uh can uh view a digit on uh on screen , yeah .
C :  to think about .
A :  No .
C :  I I don't think either .
C :  No . I don't think you need it .
A :  On screen display . Yeah . Okay th
C :  Okay . Okay , well my conclusion , um unfortunately the market has decided the a little uh other than I thought . I thought um the market would like uh a sort m sort of titanium casing , but they seem to like natural uh stuff . So maybe we should think about uh wood finish . Um I've chosen the more battery with solar cell uh solution for the energy . It's more reliable , it's cheaper . So I don't think we should use the dynamo thing . The kinetic thing it it's it's a possibility . It's it's more advanced , but I'm I think you should combine it with batteries . Otherwise it will not too advanced , uh well . It's in in in some way it can give us an advance , because you will save on your batteries . But
A :  Okay . Good .
A :  Kineti okay .
D :  Hmm .
A :  Okay , it's maybe a bit too too flashy , too yeah .
A :  Yeah , but that that's the same with the solar cell . That's no different .
C :  Yes . And I think it's more robust . It's more uh
A :  Yeah . Okay .
B :  But what about um the markets
C :  Uh it's more functional .
B :  uh wants colourfuls
B :  uh designs ? So if you use titanium
A :  No no , but the uh um that's what Sebastian said . He said uh this is what uh this is my personal preference . But but yet , I understood that the market is different . So um
C :  The titanium thing uh
C :  we have to skip it .
B :  Okay .
B :  Oh , sorry . Yeah .
C :  So I think we should skip the titanium uh stuff , and we should uh use wood or something like that .
B :  Yeah .
D :  And yeah , the yeah , the older people liked wood .
B :  And I would think
A :  No , r rubber with colours .
C :  Oh okay , sorry . So it it needs to be rubber .
D :  No the
A :  Colourful and
D :  Yeah , the younger people liked soft material .
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay , spongy materials . Okay , um well um these scroll-wheels , I think uh they they can be they can be handy . So
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
B :  And they can be implemented with a regular chip ?
C :  Yes , they can . But they really need the regular chip , you cannot use the sa simple
B :  Okay , but we also uh we already need the regular chip for the sample uh sensor speaker oh , evalu
C :  Well , I'm not very sure . Maybe that's an uh a different
A :  But but do we want the curved uh uh design , or
C :  I think so , if you if you stick with the the simple uh straight-forward uh not curve design , i uh it's too dull . I don't think c our customers will like it . And um if you uh take the double-curved , uh then you cannot um you can only use the rubber buttons and you cannot use the scroll-wheels . So I think this is the best of two worlds .
A :  I it's too dull . Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Okay .
A :  Okay , what about um the issue I um addressed at the beginning of the meeting ? Um the voice function w with the infrared uh issue . Because it it's of cour
C :  Yes .
C :  It's it's uh I uh I can imagine it's very dull to talk to a device w if you have to point to another device . It's very unlogical .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But most infrared uh remote controls don't have to be pointed at all .
C :  Well the there has to be some pointing at . But
A :  Well
A :  It depends also on your on your
B :  Well , if you if you take your hand before it , okay , it won't work , but you can point it just to the other wall . Yeah .
A :  Well , it depends on your walls actually . If you have uh have um smooth walls , it it it probably you're probably right . But if you have carpets on the wall , which our natural loving friends probably do have , then um yeah , th th it might be a bit more of a issue .
C :  All lights get absorbed , yeah .
C :  Yes , because the walls they they reflect the infrared light . So it has an it's easier . Um I suggest we use the the sensor sample . Uh the sample sensor and sample speaker .
A :  So
A :  Yeah .
C :  Um with a with a regular chip .
B :  And the regular chip .
C :  I think uh it gives us the advantage of
B :  And and the scroll uh scroll-wheels . Yeah .
C :  Yes , yes . And uh skip and skip the L_C_D_ part . I don't think it it's any uh value added thing . So
A :  I like the scroll wheels uh idea .
A :  Yeah .
B :  No . Think so too .
A :  Well , it looks uh yeah , well um according to Ruud , the the the market likes um new flashy technology , and I mean L_C_D_ is well , ok I know , but it's m it's less um s standard than than
C :  Okay .
C :  Technology .
C :  Yes . It's not very flashy and new .
D :  Standard ?
A :  Well , we are not very w we do not know uh much about the the f the financial part . That's the problem . Because if we do have enough um space in in our finance , I would say do integrate it , because
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  it it adds a little ext extra high-tech feeling to it .
C :  Yes .
B :  But we already have the scroll-wheels , the sp uh the speaker uh the speak recognition , the rubber ,
A :  Mm yeah .
C :  Uh I think our customers will go insane . It's it's too much .
B :  the fancy colours .
A :  Okay , okay .
A :  Yeah . Okay , I I agree . I think i Ruud , do you have any um anything you would like to
A :  um add or or maybe thoughts or
D :  Nah , um n no , I don't think so . M
A :  No ? Sebast uh nee , Roo ? Roo , do you have any other
B :  Um no .
B :  Nothing more .
A :  Nothing more . Um
C :  Okay .
C :  Uh the n the next phase will be um
C :  the um not the what is the next phase f Flores ?
A :  Well , we we need to describe uh decisions now . So um on the energy , well , we decided . Chip .
C :  Okay .
C :  So i
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
A :  The case uh rubber with uh c one one uh one curve . User interface um
C :  Okay , okay .
B :  Uh but uh can't scroll-wheels uh work with one uh one-curved case ? Yeah , okay . Sorry , yeah .
C :  Yes , they can work . They cannot work with double-curved . That's that's problem . I'll check it for you .
B :  Oh , sorry . Yeah .
A :  Um then the corporate identity should be uh in the product . I guess that is something for Roo and Sebastian . Uh you talked about it before , the colours , grey and yellow .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Keep it in mind . And um the buttons , well we talked about it now . The next phase , um Sebastian , um is um the design of the look and feel . The user interface design . And for you , the product evaluation . Um I'm sure your personal coach will give you more information on that . Um and uh the I_D_ and the U_I_D_ need to work together on the prototype drawing on the SMARTboard .
C :  Yes .
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
A :  And I'm going uh to plan my holidays .
C :  Okay . So you will be on the Bahamas . Uh
B :  The project drawing is for the next
A :  Yeah , it's it's uh when we come back in thirty minutes , uh you will have a uh prototype ready .
B :  Yeah , right .
C :  Okay . So can you uh give us a summary of all uh decisions we've made ?
A :  Yeah ? I can . Um maybe one of you could write it down . Great . Um
C :  I'll do .
A :  Uh you you need to help me . Um
C :  Okay . W start with the casing .
A :  The casing is curved , single-curved .
B :  Single-curved .
C :  Okay , single-curved case . Okay .
C :  What about the energy source ?
A :  Traditional batteries uh and solar .
B :  But can there be uh wor can they work together ? Or do we have to choose between them ? 'Cause if we have to choose yeah ?
A :  No , they can be complementary . Uh al al I uh
C :  I I think they can . Yes .
B :  Okay . What if not ?
C :  Well , uh
A :  Every device
C :  It it should be . There should be really no problem . They can be supplementary . That's no problem . So
B :  Okay .
A :  Yeah . Okay , um th
C :  So uh uh just uh the energy source is um the batteries and the solar . Okay .
A :  Battery and solar , yeah .
C :  What about uh the finishing of the case ?
C :  We have decided we wanted to use the rubber ?
A :  Yeah , with colourful rubber . Uh if it's possible with uh different um covers , but I'm not sure if our suppliers can uh can help us with uh with such uh uh a wish .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay , and I think we should use the company colours . Something like black and red . uh black and yellow .
A :  Uh grey and yellow or black and yellow . Yeah .
B :  Grey and yellow .
C :  Grey yellow , okay .
B :  Yellow case and grey buttons , I think .
A :  Yeah , although I don't think that's very colourful . Except for the yellow of course , but um I could think of a more uh attractive uh c uh set of colours .
D :  Hmm .
C :  Oh , I think it's uh it's not very dull . It's quite modern actually . Don't you think ?
A :  Well , I was more thinking about the fruit colours that the Ruud showed us before .
B :  I believe the
B :  But you have already um you must have a red uh on and off button .
B :  And um
A :  Well , it it doesn't have to be red .
B :  Well well
A :  Uh I mean th uh I think these colours are really what our young people are looking for . Um so maybe it shouldn't even be two colours , it should be a full colour cover with such an image or or I mean thinking in two colours is is too black and white for our m uh c uh market group , I guess .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Okay .
D :  Or black and yellow .
A :  Black and yellow , yeah .
C :  Okay , but uh I'm afraid it's not possible to print a picture on uh the device . Because uh I agree it would be nice to have have something like that on the device itself . But
B :  Well , there is . Just a week ago , a keyboard manufacturer would print , with and uh
C :  Oh , I've read . Yes .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Yes , but our manufacturing department is not so advanced in its uh techniques . They're actually very slow in its techniques .
B :  No .
A :  Okay , so we have to deal with wh what's possible here .
C :  So
C :  So I'm afraid it's not possible .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Um more f more more decisions we made . Um
A :  Um
B :  A scroll-wheel .
A :  The scroll-heel . Yes , the voice recognition we already decided .
B :  Voice recognition , of course .
C :  Okay , so scroll-wheel . But there will be some additional buttons , I guess . And th the they should be spongy also , because they're they're rubber too .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Uh I'm going to leave that up to you two .
B :  What what did you say ?
C :  Well uh you can use well , when you use the buttons , they'll they'll be made of rubber too . So it has th the spongy uh feel also . So I I think that's okay .
B :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah , or you could use plastic buttons .
B :  In the rubber .
A :  I think rubber is nice . Because it uh i I mean what do you touch the button , and what do they want spongy uh uh devices , or or i
B :  Yeah , b
B :  But then you just have the the fact that um the drawings on the buttons will disappear eventually .
A :  .
B :  What I said in the in the first uh discussion , uh the digit six on the button , it will disappear when it's from rubber .
A :  Uh is that uh does our our supplier say so ?
B :  It is not uh something uh it's no information I read about it or so , but it's just from
D :  Uh didn't did we inc uh include the digi digits or uh leave them to the speech recognition ? 'Cause things like uh volume could be uh placed next to the button .
B :  No , but but uh it
A :  Yeah . You could place a um uh this this would be the button .
D :  There the icons .
A :  The scroll-wheel , I mean . And you could place
B :  Yeah , b yeah .
A :  the indica th th the signals the
C :  Yes .
D :  So you don't touch the icons that much .
C :  That's okay .
B :  Yeah , that's possible , but then you have still the images on the rubber of the case .
B :  So still then , if you feel uh li uh if you feel your remote control , you just rub on the cover , so you rub on the painting .
A :  No no , there's no painting , only uh yellow or
B :  Yeah .
A :  But it's into the rubber .
B :  Yeah , but but the the plus or the minus .
C :  Yes , the signs .
B :  You have to draw the
A :  Yeah , but this is on the pla yeah , I know . Um I think uh I know which you understand af uh I know what you mean . What about um making this rubber
B :  Yeah , it's on the cover . So if you uh
B :  You just move the problem .
A :  and making this plastic ?
C :  Uh I see what you mean .
C :  Well , maybe that's possible , because um uh our manufacturing division also offers plastic finishing . So maybe they can combine these two .
A :  Yeah . Well actually , we should have it the other way around , I guess . A plastic cover with rubber finishing . I mean , this is this is the finishing . This is um what's on the edge . What you feel . But the front ,
C :  Yeah .
A :  on which the the buttons are doesn't have to be rubber . I mean
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Well , I'm I'm not so sure , I think it c should be
B :  Y uh can you separate these uh these
C :  Well , I'm not sure , I have to ask with manufacturing , but I'm I'm not sure that's what you want , because our customers specifically ask for the spongy feel , and that's what you get with rubber . So if you want the spongy feel , you need uh to make these buttons all all of rubber .
A :  I know , but do you touch this or do you touch this ?
C :  I think both .
A :  I mean , I I never touch between the buttons .
B :  I do . Or the s uh the sideways . Or the the back . Or the back .
C :  I do .
C :  I think
A :  Yeah , the side , exactly , the sideways . The side , but do you touch between the the these buttons ?
B :  I think
B :  Yes , especially when there are l a few buttons on it , you have uh a lot of space to touch . So you just have it in your hand completely or or i you play with it .
A :  Okay . Well , we do not have very much time uh left . Um I guess you two have to figure that out . I'm going to leave the decision to you , um because you have to make its prototype , and um yeah y you have the most knowledge about the suppliers , the possibilities and uh so I'm going to leave it the decision with you . Um Sebastian , did you write enough decisions down ?
B :  Yeah .
B :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  Um not quite . Um what about
C :  uh the chips ? We use the regular chip ? Okay .
B :  Regular .
A :  Yeah .
C :  And
B :  Use with .
C :  Well no , I think that's about it .
C :  Yes .
A :  Okay . With those regular chips we can still uh control advanced functions . The chip is is not really
C :  The only difference between the advanced and the regular version is that the advanced uh version of the chip supports L_C_D_ . That's all . And we've decided not to use L_C_D_ . So
A :  Okay , well .
A :  Yeah . Okay . Um okay , then I think we are uh quite finished .
A :  Um I'll see you guys in thirty minutes and um
B :  .
B :  For the finishing touch .
A :  Yeah ? Yeah , um if you write wrote anything down , uh could you put it on the shared folder ?
C :  Okay .
C :  Okay .
B :  Uh yeah .
A :  Yeah .
B :  But um
B :  Sebastian has everything .
A :  I know , but well
C :  I'll put it online .
A :  Great .
A : 
C : 
A :  Right .
C :  Did you manage ?
D :  Yeah , sh not quite .
C :  Okay .
D :  You will see uh
C :  Ah . Hello .
A :  Hello . So , are you d what were j you guys discussing ?
C :  No , just uh ask if if he could manage .
D : 
D :  Woah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Okay . Did you find anything new ?
D :  Mm uh nothing special . Uh
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  I have a lot of new information .
D :  Yeah , the for uh the trendy uh stuff .
A :  Great , great .
D :  A little bit . I uh now will show it .
A :  Come on .
A :  .
C :  Hey , everything alright . Did you manage ?
B :  Well , I had just a little bit of time , so I hope it's something uh we can work with . But
C :  Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  What's uh here .
D :  Yeah , I had the same . It just uh
C :  Do you have a lot of new information ? Do you have a lot of new information ?
D :  shuts itself down and
B :  Hmm ?
B :  Well , I heard that there was a new uh component speech recognition component , which was pretty much up to standard , so we might use that I put that in my drawing , but again I didn't not have that much time . So
D :  Oh .
C :  That's true .
A :  And there we are .
C :  Huh .
C :  Alright . I have a lot of new information . I have a complete list of uh everything that we can use , all the components that all av available . I have no I still don't have any finance information , but at least we have a lot more to go on now
A :  What the f oh , yeah uh .
A :  It doesn't do what I want it
B :  Okay , that's just super . Let me just
D :  .
B :  uh
A :  Okay fine , that's too bad . Yeah , I have to start our
B :  You need to start it up first ? Okay .
A :  'Kay .
A :  Okay , go again . Well second phase , conceptual design . It's fine , everybody knows what we're talking about . So , take you past the minutes of last meeting again . Again you get your three presentate to see what you came up with . So too bad we don't have any finance information apparently . So that's too bad . So then we'll just have to d uh have to go on , you know , the information that we have to make the make final decisions on uh on a conceptual design . So
D :  Yep .
A :  Here we go . Anyway , last w last w what discussed last time , you all remember that , that we have to keep the electronics size in mind . Same goes for you . We have to have an easy design with big buttons which are durable and there are people actually spen willing to spend money to do to get more features and uh among those features L_C_D_ screen and voice recognition are very popular . So we have to make a move on that area , I guess . S especially s when when the new uh component is applicable in our uh product , we'll be fine .
A :  Anyways , well teletext wasn't important and that's what I took . And the consumer , yeah , we aim for young consumers , so that's fine . And well actually we yeah , we did need some more data on finances , but w yeah we still don't have that apparently . That's too bad . Yeah , we need to im de we are going to implement the beep and the flash thing to recover your remote . So one of these interchangeable covers apparently which will make it a more fashionable product . So anyway .
D :  Mm uh-huh .
A :  Guess we'll have to do this after the after the you give your presentations . So I'll just close this one now , and let's uh let's see , . We have a lot to tell . You had a lot to go on . So uh how about you go first .
B :  Okay , what t
D :  I bet
C :  Yep , that's right .
B :  Okay , yeah .
D :  Oh okay .
C :  Let's see where my
C :  presentation is .
C :  Okay , um this I mentioned before . Every feature for our remote control needs to have their own operating electronic devices . We need to take care of that . Then warning , uh there has to be a chip in our remote control . And the chip requirements uh needed for a normal button uh is just a simple chip , uh scroll-wheel , and L_C_D_ is an advanced . Of course this is more expensive than this . So we have to decide on that in a minute . The available uh components for energy are , we have a basic battery , a hand an uh dynamo , like in uh old torches . We have a kin uh kinetic provision , then you have to shake the remote control to get the energy . And we have solar cells . I suggest that we uh decide on that one uh immediately . Then I have all lists . So
A :  Okay .
C :  My personal uh fav favourite is the kinetic provision because uh I ha
D :  Um
A :  Does it provide enough energy ?
C :  I think so , yes .
A :  Also if if we were choose the the L_C_D_ option , would it give enough energy Okay , that's the just assume it takes .
C :  Yes .
C :  Yes . Because I had the information uh you take uh the remote control , you pick it up at least two times a day . So then it's already shaken and gives energy .
A :  Well , I'm not sure if it's shaken enough , because
B :  Is that enough ? Because I don't really see people shaking their remote control before using it .
C :  .
C :  Or
A :  No , I don't think so , because uh watches can go on kinetic energy because they move all the time . But I'm sure t I mean remotes lie still I think like ninety nine percent of the time . So I don't think that's a really good the other alternative were solar cells . I don't think that's applicable because
C :  Think
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Other options are solar cells , hand dynamo and basic battery .
B :  No .
A :  I thin why why shouldn't we take a basic battery ?
B :  And what does the hand dynamo oh , sorry .
D :  Yeah . A rechargeable maybe .
C :  Only basic battery ? Okay , but I think this is not a r
A :  Why not ? I mean everybody everybody knows how to use that . It's it's common . So and it's available everywhere . So why sh mm I think better .
D :  Re rechargeable basi
C :  .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Yeah , but I think this rules out our unit our rechargeable unit . This is really a really basic battery , a normal battery .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Yeah , but it's
A :  Yeah , uh it wasn't it wasn't in the options , a rechargeable m module actually .
B :  Oh .
C :  Huh ?
C :  Okay , that's uh . Okay ?
A :  Okay yeah , b you c of course you could place re re-chargeable batteries . But that's up to the consumer himself . So
D :  Yep . Basic .
C :  Okay , but then we don't offer a re-chargement function . That's what it says .
A :  Well , mm it's not in the list . So we cannot choose from it . So
C :  Exactly . Alright . Right . Yep . Next one is curving . Uh we can make a model that has one curve , two or three .
A :  Okay , will just take regular batteries .
D :  Okay .
C :  And uh uh th uh the shape . Of course uh the more curves the more expensive . Exactly . Yes .
B :  Curves being ?
D :  Okay .
B :  Of the remote control itself , okay . I was thinking along the line of one curve . I'll show that in my design .
D :  But
D :  But
D :  It dep
D :  But
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay , we'll get back on that later . Just
B :  So we'll get back to that .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm . I think one curve is uh fine .
D :  Yeah .
A :  But what were the implications if you if put more curves it it's gets more expensive . Okay , so I think with with the extras that we had there it's two curves I suppose . Okay .
D :  Depends on the user .
C :  More expensive . More difficult to make .
C :  Exactly . And I believe even that the r the number of options we have on putting things in it uh goes down with exactly . Material . I have to offer a plastic , rubber , wood or titanium . Uh if we choose plastic , we cannot choose solar cells for energy . If we choose titanium , uh we cannot use more than one curve .
A :  Also decreases , okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  But we don't have that so fast .
A :  More than one curve , uh yeah okay . We'll just go uh
B :  Okay , I t I'd go for plastic because I have a couple of curves in my design . Well , g let's just get back to that .
A :  'Cause it yeah , I'm not sure .
C :  Mm .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Mm .
A :  We'll discuss that later . Okay , we have so I think we can rule out um I'm not sure we can rule anything out . We'll do that when y when you get your design .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Okay .
C :  No .
C :  But I think wood is not an option either .
B :  No , wood's not an option . No .
A :  No , wood i wood's not an option . Well it it's stylish , but we can yeah , but you can change your covers anyway .
C :  Okay .
C :  Hmm .
D :  No .
C :  Okay . My personal thought was uh rubber because I had an email , I believe it was from you , uh f against falling .
A :  Yeah , is it keep in mind that it it's it's uh it fal uh remote controls fall a lot on the ground . So you don't want it to break . So either have rubber edges or a rubber remote control is very durable . But Continue .
D : 
C :  Hmm .
C :  Okay . Uh
B :  Yeah , but it doesn't have to be unbreakable , because we do need to keep selling these thing
D :  No .
A :  Don't have to be un-breakable , it's p it's a it's not supposed to ju yeah , break after one use . I mean it they they fall a lot . So
C :  Mm .
B :  Okay , well that that's definitely true .
C :  Yeah .
C :  Mm . I think we have to decide on this anyway . Uh because if we make removeable covers , it has to be one of those mat materials . We have no more than this . So
B :  Because it well , ru will rubber actually protect the remote control itself ? Because it
D : 
A :  Well , you have for if you if for example if you take hard plastic . If it falls it might crack . And rubber uh kind of softens the fall .
B :  Yeah , but then you buy a new cover . But rubber
A :  I'm not sure if it's the it's the entire cover you change . Uh , it's could be .
D :  Are are we focussi focussing on on the
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  You know what , th we're focusing very much on the covers now . I think it's just w now we're going for the basic design . If we wanna expand our options , f be fashionable , then we can get changeable covers . But I think the basic thing let's just rule out wood for now and continue .
D :  But
D :  But
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Okay .
D :  Not that but are we focussing on the uh younger people or the elder people ? Younger , okay . Yeah , that's okay . Nah , that's
A :  We're definitely focussing on the younger people , 'cause that was our main goal .
C :  Alright . Then I proceed , but I need to know after this meeting . So Interface , uh I have four things to offer , pu uh normal push-buttons of course . Um uh we have a lot of expertise on that one . We have a large history , our company , on push-buttons . Scroll-wheels , uh those can be pushed as well , although that is more expensive . Um liquid crystal colour display and um
A :  Okay okay , we will .
B :  Okay .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  What is this ? Okay , and if we use rubber , I already mentioned that , we can only use rubber buttons . So rubber can only match with rubber . Which one of those are we gonna use ? Push-buttons , that's b uh I think basic .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Evident . Yeah , o of course we're gonna use . But I didn't I didn't go on the thought of a scroll-wheel actually . I'm still deciding on what what what could you use it for . Maybe for volume control . Channel , I think that would be annoying because it might accidentally scroll onto another channel . I think a push-button for channel would be better . I mean it for volume control it's it's a smoother motion , you can just increase or decrease . But not sure . For channels will be good .
B :  Yeah , of cour
C :  Huh .
D :  But
C :  No .
C :  I think the channels .
C :  Oh .
C :  Yeah .
C :  .
C :  Huh ?
C :  Huh .
C :  Hmm . But
B :  Yeah , but there is a is it really necessary 'cause a normal push-button can do that job .
A :  I don't think so . I haven't I haven't taken it into consideration .
C :  Huh ? Oh . Ah so but it looks cool . Mm no .
D :  But th the younger people my investigation turns out that the younger people want a little bit uh material that that is uh spongy and uh
A :  I don't think we really need one .
C :  Oh . Ah . flashy and yeah .
A :  .
C :  I think would be cool , scroll-wheel . It's not that much uh if we take a normal scroll-wheel without the pushing , then it's not expensive . We can do that .
D :  So
D :  A sc
A :  But why do we need it ?
B :  Yeah , but why would we use it ?
C :  Think .
C :  Ah we don't need it , but it's uh it's design a design thing .
D :  Yeah .
A :  If we don't need it , why put it in your why put it in your in your if it's if it's not something people are looking for or is useful .
D :  Yeah , you get
D :  No .
C :  I think they are looking for that . Of course we have uh a young target group . So they might find that attractive in a remote con
A :  Are they ?
D :  Scroll-wheel ? Uh I don't know .
A :  Yeah , but if it's if it's not useful , I don't think it I don't think it gives an extra function to the remote . Anyway
D :  Yeah , that's it .
C :  Okay . So push-buttons we will use . Uh L_C_D_ screen ?
B :  Perhaps . I have t I have two different
C :  Is that s
A :  What you what what'd you get on the L_C_D_ screen ? Is it expensive ? Does it
D :  Yeah .
C :  Uh I only know that if we are using that , we need ano uh an advanced chip in it . And that is more expensive .
A :  And how much more expensive is that ? Or
C :  I have no idea . I have no absolute numbers . I only have
A :  No absolute numbers , but it's just more expensive and takes more room I suppose in your in your design .
B :  Okay .
D :  .
C :  Yeah , but I don't think room is really an issue .
A :  Don't think it's an issue , okay . Oh let's go for let's say because it is uh very hot in n our target group I think , we should take it take it t to consideration to build an L_C_D_ screen in it .
D :  .
B :  I have two designs , one including uh an L_C_D_ screen , wh which is basically the deluxe edition . And then I also have a standard edition , which wi we can also choose to develop too .
D :  For the future .
A :  Okay .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Which basically has the same functionality , but lacks the L_C_D_ screen . Okay . We'll pick a we'll pick from uh we'll just combine everything later .
B :  Exactly .
B :  But we'll
C :  Mm-hmm . Okay . Electronics , uh the first one is the chip . Uh that's no longer an option , it has to be an advanced one now . 'Cause we have the L_C_D_ screen . Then we have an infrared sender , I think that's basic , we cannot do without . Otherwise it's not s a remote control . And we have the sample sensor and speaker , the voice recognition thing . Are we gonna do that or not ?
B :  Yep .
B :  Basically , it
D :  Yep .
A :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Once again I was would ask you if it's expensive , but apparently you don't have any data . So
B :  Oh , I got
C :  I only have uh uh relative information .
A :  Well what d what was exact what you got on the on the new component ?
B :  I got an email that it's relatively small .
A :  That's small . So we can implement it . So why why if it's small and we can imp why shouldn't we ?
B :  Yes , let me just
B :  Get back .
C :  Oh how did you
A :  And there's um get your mar marketing report ? What was uh the last number of how many people were interested in voice recognition ?
C :  That goes also for the scroll-wheel , by the way .
D :  Um uh
A :  Although it's hard for different countries of course .
D :  The most of them um
A :  But you have to programme it yourself , I suppose , with your own voice .
D :  Um uh more than uh sixty percent .
A :  More than sixty percent of the people would like voice recognition .
D :  Yeah . Mean of uh seventy percent I think . Uh I'm I have to look it up .
C :  Hmm .
A :  If it's small , if it's fits , if if people like it , why not ? So
C :  Yeah .
C :  Hmm . But don't we have any w uh information about scroll-wheel ? Scroll-wheel . If people would like that . That's strange , because that's the same story . It's it's not necessary like an L_C_D_ , but it's just it adds something to the design .
D :  No .
D :  No , only
D :  Ah . I don't know .
A :  Yeah , but we got some data on people that actually are int are interested in that , and I don't think a scroll-wheel offers new functionality , whereas speech recognition and L_C_D_ screen do offer new functionality in your product .
C :  Hmm .
D :  On the most spee
C :  No .
D :  But
C :  Oh that's r
D : 
C :  But I think uh we now already have to uh implement uh an advanced chip . So it's m
A :  Uh I think so , because if I think we're specially w if you're going maybe uh if you have the two editions you wanna wanna give out , probably you have one with uh with speech recognition and
D :  Yeah , for the future .
B :  Well , they b they basically can have speech recognition . I mainly focused on the L_C_D_ uh aspect .
A :  Um
A :  Yeah , hold on a minute . Were were you we're finished ? Or
C :  No , but that's that's okay .
A :  Oh .
A :  Because if there's something that
C : 
B :  'Cause you wanted to see them , right ?
C :  There is still time .
A :  'Cause have did you have all the materials ? Or everything that you desc
C :  Yes , this was uh the last M_S_ . I have a clear picture .
A :  Okay , so uh just just go for design for now . Just m have a seat for a second . Uh
A :  We'll combine everything after this .
B :  So this is basically the deluxe edition .
A :  Why is it s why is it squared ?
B :  I j
B :  Why is it square ?
A :  Why did you pick square ? Or uh not square , but why is it yeah , sharp corners .
B :  It 'cause it's designy .
B :  It's basically it has some futuristic
B :  Potentially , yeah . I don't really know . But I just thought that uh in normal remote controls you have like smooth curves and this and that , and this is something new , this is something different , something fresh .
D :  Yeah .
D :  People
A :  Looks like a Star Trek phaser .
A :  It's true .
B :  And basically what you can see here is that it has a little , yeah , let's say gap which you can put your finger in .
A :  Yeah . Or Okay , so just yeah , you can rest it on your finger . Okay .
D :  So only r right-handed .
B :  So you can you can hold it really comfortable , that's basically the idea .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  But it but it's only right-handed then . Not for the left . Or
B :  Or left hand . I doesn't really matter .
A :  No , it just uh it's a curve inside a thing . So
C :  Hmm .
B :  As you can see , this is the remote control
D :  Where ?
A :  It's on the back .
D :  Oh in the back , okay . Oh yeah yeah .
B :  Uh you can't really see it that well , but this is the L_C_D_ screen . So just imagine it goes that way . Then you can see you can hold it in your left or in your right hand . And I also made a quick image , 'cause I did not have that much time ,
D :  Okay .
A :  Yeah , I think it's okay .
D :  Oh yeah yeah . Okay . Yeah . Yeah yeah .
D :  Yeah . I thought it
B :  of the standard edition
B :  which has basically the keys are pretty much the same .
A :  Keys are probably the n the number keys , I suppose .
B :  Yeah . I had to do this really fast . So excuse me for the uh inconvenience here , but as you can see , the keys moved .
A :  Okay .
A :  Well , you can work on the actual concept or actual design later with him . But
B :  Yeah .
B :  So these are basically the two types we have . So if we were to select the L_C_D_ screen , the transmitter here , you can see the light i
A :  Well , I think what you have to keep in mind is that um you're moving the the the number keys from the top . Uh in the the simple design you have them at a top , and the uh complex design you have them at the bottom . So it would that would give us a totally different design . So which actually making a whole different product instead of two different models . I think it would be very expensive to produce two whole different products . So
B :  Well we can shift that . But normally , as you can see there , we put the uh number buttons right on top .
B :  Whereas because we had the L_C_D_ screen here , we had to move them downward , so what you could say is that
A :  Yeah , uh or for example , why did you pick the mm the numbers uh all the way below , and the and the channels and volume control
B :  Because these are basically the functions you use the most . So if you hold it in your hand like this , you put your finger in the gap , this is the m most easy part .
D :  Well it it's yeah .
A :  Okay .
B :  Bit .
C :  Hmm , I agree .
B :  For zapping , cau because people are zapping most of the time .
A :  That's fine . That's fine .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Just as long as you tak took it into consideration what people would prefer . Uh , okay if you all agree , I'm fine with it . But
C :  Hmm .
D :  Yeah .
B :  Okay . So that's pretty much ha which I had in mind . As you can see here , this can be spaced for extra keys , which is the design thingys .
A :  Okay .
D :  No it maybe it's better to look uh what the people want . So I can uh show my uh investigation .
A :  Yeah , I think we'll
A :  I think we're going towards the deluxe edition anyway , because that seems to be what the people want . But let's see what's what they want now .
D :  Yeah , maybe it's better .
B :  Yeah .
D :  Especially for young people .
A :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Um where is that ? Where is th
A :  That's mine .
D :  Oh . Uh
A :  No , you should send it to the f to the folder first .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Mm I forgot that .
A :  Okay um , let's just assume we go to forty one .
D :  Okay , now it must be there .
D :  Yeah , here it is .
D :  Oh yeah .
D :  Okay , uh the investigation turns out that the most appear uh people want um um uh look and feel likes is uh uh the s the same as before , but it must be w a little bit fancier than uh the the look of it . Um the second important thing is um the it must be uh technol technological uh innova vative . So that's the L_C_D_ screen is perfect , I think , and not uh
B :  Speech recognition .
D :  Yeah , tha that's uh very important .
D :  And a third thing is
D :  um yeah , it's uh should be easy to use , so not not too much bu buttons and uh channel selection . I think that's uh what you showed is uh perfect .
D :  And what the pe young people want is uh in Paris and and in Milan uh it showed out that the fruit and vegetables are uh are trendy . Th they you s you see it in the clothes and everything . And um the contrast uh of it , it must uh the the buttons must a little bit spongy material . So uh rubber , I think uh th that's the best .
A :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  No . Yeah , uh I agree .
A :  Mm-hmm .
B :  Then rubber would be the best as a material indeed . If that is the uh
D :  No . So we are uh we were focussing uh on the younger people . So the elder , yeah , they wanted a little bit of wood in it and uh that's uh th that's not uh important now .
A :  I think so .
C :  Okay , agreement .
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , so we're definitely going for rubber .
B :  It could be a c it could be a cover . But it's not . Our focus is the young audience . So let's stick to that .
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah , but
A :  Let's just go
D :  Yeah .
A :  Uh-huh .
D :  'Cause uh n I I I I thought uh it makes a young uh classic remote with uh
A :  Nah , I think we're in this case you're losing the the focus on the young group , because we're that's what we're focussing on . So I think the spongy feel gives us rubber .
D :  Yeah , that's why I I d uh
D :  decided
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  With a fruit uh
A :  Yeah , w th apparently
D :  cover ov or something like that . Uh
A :  Yeah , apparently yeah , maybe also yeah , I tend to disagree with with uh with a sharp form . I suppose it basi if you're uh saying fruits and vegetables , maybe it's supposed to be a little little more round .
D :  .
D :  Yeah , in in form of an uh vegetable or an uh fruit , maybe .
A :  Yeah , for exa maybe like uh like a pear or something .
B :  Yeah , but that's just more a se a seasonal , a trend thing . The idea now is is is that you can uh put a cover on it , for example , with fruit , like a shape or whatever . But not 'cause a n next year it will it'll be something completely different . And then you have your apple-shaped remote control , which is not trendy anymore . So I think that's more something you can focus
D :  And
D :  Oh , where is your
C :  That's true .
A :  That's what we're doing .
D :  A trendy
A :  Mm .
A :  I think shape is is important , because they s they really extend .
C :  Hmm .
D :  Here he here you can put a
C :  Hmm .
C :  Oh , that's true .
A :  Yeah , but now you have your your like your Star Trek phaser thing shaped control . So I I th the edges are really really sharp . I'm uh not su
B :  Well , you can s
D :  Uh maybe it
B :  What you can do is smooth the edges indeed . But that will bring extra c expenses .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  Or maybe just make it make it up into into a low a smooth curve instead of just less sharp twist on the outside .
D :  But
D :  Yeah .
D :  All uh veg uh fruit and vegetables are round . So it's better
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I think I think there needs to be a little I think it's too too sharp . The edges are too sharp . The bottom is fine of course if it's square . But maybe just th make uh the top a little round it off on the sides . So I mean y
D :  Yeah .
C :  But I think , according to my information , this would be two curves .
A :  That would be two curves .
D :  Two ?
C :  We have one left and one right , and that disables what was it again ?
D :  But it
C :  It's some it's something that we cannot do then .
A :  One cur you could also make the curve go through of course . But that would make make the top round .
B :  Well we've got we've got like one curve here .
C :  Okay , that's not a problem . That's only for the titanium . We don't have .
B :  For the gap .
D :  But it's that that's for the comfort . It's it's not for the trendy thing of it .
B :  And we could have one here .
B :  No , no no no no . What I'm just 'cause you mentioned that more curves the more expensive , so I'm just taking that into account .
D :  Yeah ? Okay , yeah .
C :  Yes .
A :  But let's see , titanium would give us only one curve . So but we're not d we're not using titanium .
D : 
C :  Then w yeah , but we don't have that . So we have
D :  So the no .
C :  We have no .
B :  Well we picked rubber , right ?
A :  Right , we did . So
C :  But they uh
D :  We m
B :  So basically what we can do is m make these edges a little bit less sharp . But the problem then is that it will start to resemble m the remote controls as we have them today . We were looking at something fresh , something trendy
A :  Just doodle something on the board on the left .
D :  form .
A :  Well actually , we're setting ourselves apart from by technology alone actually .
A :  So that let's see what you're doing .
C :  They th these wha are what they call the curves . This side , this side , this is how they count .
A :  Oh , okay . I don't think like that . Not not really the curves on the on the side of the remote .
B :  Okay .
C :  No no . This is what they uh what they mean . Okay , that's not really a good .
B :  Okay , so that's basically silly .
A :  Okay , now I uh of course now I understand why they have more uh like um
A :  Why the curves
A :  um decrease the the um the size the electronics that can be inside . So Okay .
A :  I don't think the outside would be called as a curve really .
D :  Yeah .
C :  It's like this .
A :  I think it's for all the basic well , looking from the side anyway . Well , if you see what I have to come up with some designs fast anyway . So
D :  But you can make uh if you want to use a fruit in uh in uh
C :  Hmm .
A :  Okay .
B :  But isn't the f the fruit like a cover thing , because we
D :  Uh
A :  Well , you shouldn't focus on the mostly on the covers , because lot of things we came up with , shouldn't be too really too much shouldn't be too focussed on the covers because it's kind of an idea of our own , but we're not sure if we can actually make that .
D :  Hey , you
D :  You can make it like
C :  Hmm .
B :  No , but
D :  Like this .
B :  But if we put that directly into the design , we limit ourselves extremely . Because it that's just for one seasonal trend .
A :  That's the one thing I'm also afraid of with this one because it the edges are really um they might stick out on the on the side for example . If you have a basic design , a little m a little smaller on the on the s on the edges , you could put more covers on it , y one one with square or um sharp corners if you want to . So M just round it off a little , I guess , because so we have more options I suppose .
D :  Well
D :  Oh .
D :  As a example . But
C :  Hmm .
D :  I d
B :  Okay , so that's well , that's probabl
C :  Hmm .
B :  , you'd just like it to go a little bit more like this .
A :  I think so because it looks leaner and we should just go with that . Anyway , you have all the time in the world to make to make the final design in a minute with him . So So we decided on what what did you guys wanna know again because this is um anyway , I'll fire up my thing . So so we come to a decision .
B :  Okay .
D :  Hmm .
B :  Did you present e everything you wanted to ?
C :  Yep . So I can uh qui oh . I can quickly make a conclusion
B :  Okay .
A :  Uh what the
C :  of what we have decided so far .
B :  Uh we still need to decide on a couple of things you you needed to know .
A :  Ah .
A :  Yeah .
A :  Okay , anyway . Uh energy , we choose regular regular batteries . The chip is advanced because we have the advanced features . The case , it will be the material will be rubber , suppose . Wouldn't the b the design we talked about . Uh user interface , type .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Well I think we took all the components separately what we want . Um let's see um supplements . I'm not sure what they mean by that . Anyway , um apparently you guys , you should work together on the final design , both on internal and external design . So
A :  Yeah , you should you should probably find out how the product will fall into the market , how uh what's gonna happen with the final design as we have it now . So Yeah , of course you've got your specific instruction as usual . So Wanna spend some more um I think we're in a pretty much in agreement actually , which is good . So
D :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
B :  Are we all in agreement about the , well , the primary structure of the of my design ? Except for the edges . Like the keys there .
A :  Lef let's see , where the pen go ? Here .
A :  Yeah uh open your thing again . Let's see what if you can come up with anything new . Um I'll just do a next one .
A :  So what would give us your ne your design would be the lights would be on top , right ? Uh one on each one on each side .
B :  Yeah .
B :  To create a kind of disco effect when you
B :  That was basically what w
A :  Is it is it the lights for for finding the finding remote or lights that it that
B : 
B :  Light for the finding of the remote . We can also use one light for
B :  showing that the signal is being sent . But
A :  Yeah , I think that should just be a simple LED or something . Like that that's not that important of course . It just like a matter of a a beep if you pre that you just know that that there's context . So I don't think that's super important . But
A :  Hmm .
B :  So we have the teletext we have here , we have the mute .
A :  Uh sh Oh .
B :  L_C_D_ screen . This is the on off button .
D :  And speech w recognition . Are we
B :  Speech recognition , I where did I imagine . I did that pretty much over here , so that you could use it like this
D :  We
D :  Little uh voice uh
D :  Record and a uh no .
B :  and speak to it . Then you have the uh extra keys for teletext , mute , two buttons which can be pretty much anything or nothing . We can also just not use them .
A :  Let's see , I'll just make
B :  Main controls and a key-pad .
D :  Yeah .
A :  One light here .
A :  And just make it red now . But it could be any colour . So
B :  Will be fine .
A :  Okay , whatever . Fine , anyway . What do we have here ? M I'll make it um are we gonna use square buttons or round ones actually ?
A :  Personally I would prefer round ones .
C :  Me too .
B :  Yeah , but that would this was just in the design . Because if you I had a square design . So I had square buttons . But in that case the round buttons would be more appropriate .
D :  Form of fruit . It's better .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah , for
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay , I assume it for so we take a r take a round power button right here .
A :  Whatever . Uh back to black .
A :  Uh not too big though .
A :  See this would be good .
A :  Um let's see .
A :  Are these for any extra controls ?
B :  Yeah . The left one is teletext and the right one is mute . And these two buttons are or not necessary or
A :  Okay .
A :  Okay . If we go for for round buttons in general , do we want to the menu key in the middle to be round ? For example , if you let's see , put it this here . I think we'll go with the triangles that Come on .
B :  Yeah , the triangles would be best indeed .
A :  Triangles are good .
A :  Yeah , they're a little too big now . But
A :  Anyway , okay . So do you want for example a
A :  round button in the middle or square one ?
B :  I personally think that a round b button looks bit silly , but
C :  Hmm .
A :  I'm not sure uh , I just just came up with it .
D :  Yeah .
A :  This aligns nicely . So
A :  Okay . We'll just take the take the round button , suppose . Uh oh the square button , sorry .
B :  Does everybody agree on that ?
D :  Yep .
A :  I suppose so .
C :  I would prefer round . But doesn't matter , doesn't matter .
B :  You prefer a round ? Okay .
A :  Okay .
C :  That's not a big deal , think .
A :  So there's our numbers . Think we need an extra button here of course for yeah , like you had for the
A :  higher numbers .
A :  And you could include a button here for the mute , I suppose .
A :  For something else , just to
B :  Yeah , you can . But it but it's not necessary , becau
A :  mirror mirror the effect with this . That's not necessary because it you can take this away , but there it looks like there's a hole there , just to mirror the effect . Okay , so we have a few
B :  We could put our logo there .
A :  Nah , I think it it would be nice to put the logo here , for example , if you have some buttons here .
A :  We could put a logo here because it's very always in your field of vision . If you're watching it , the L_C_D_ screen , blah blah .
D :  And what about Oh .
D :  What about a button for your uh favourite channel ?
B :  Oh that could be that b
A :  Well we could we could include either here
D :  Uh yeah . With the extra controls . Uh
A :  or here , for example . But you think here or here ?
B :  Well now it's getting a little bit too crowded up there . So Is your
D :  Uh one one set
A :  I know .
D :  Yeah , you have to put it up uh
B :  So it can basically be the button down below or one of the four buttons up there . Because
A :  No , we could put this one as favourite channel for exam
D :  One of the four . Uh , it's better than , I think .
A :  What are these for ? Okay .
B :  One of the four is better , I suppose .
D :  It's a favourite channel .
A :  What ?
D :  What ? Nee , uh one of the four uh
B :  Because it's a little bit confusing to have twelve buttons down there , because you're only accustomed to eleven , I'd say .
D :  It's better th
A :  You're accustomed to eleven ?
A :  My uh okay , have it your way . I mean , think this looks rather like like there's something missing for example . I mean why wouldn't you include a 'cause there is a um a piece of electronics under there anyway . So why not give it a function . Let's say I mean could be anything . But th
B :  Oh , we still need an okay button .
C :  Hmm . Hmm .
B :  Well , you could also shift the two buttons to be nicely aligned .
A :  No , I don't think because this is a zero . But you want zero to be mis-aligned with the rest . Anyway , so this is the basic design , we wanna have um on and off what are we missing ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  If it looks um
B :  Oh , we're pretty much missing an okay button , but we have a button up there which is still free . So
A :  Okay , so we want the remote to be the s the side view actually , what I'm gonna draw . So
A :  probably think you want the curve to be here . So have your finger under here like this , I suppose ? Okay .
B :  Yeah , pretty much .
A :  Just gonna be sh
D :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah . Want this straight or what ? Let's keep it at this .
A :  So it would be like this .
A :  Do we want something interesting with it or see .
A :  Would give us a light here . Maybe it's boring . You want it curved or what ? Maybe you want
B :  Well , I think it looks better curved . But that's probably uh
A :  Should like this ?
A :  Will give us design problem because we have
D :  Mm .
C :  Huh .
C :  It can be curved .
D :  Why ?
B :  It can be curved , because that yeah , it's a little bit more trendy to be curved .
C :  Yes .
A :  It can be curved . Okay ? I think so . That's why I asked you .
A :  Okay . So
C :  I would curve the whole actually .
B :  Hmm ?
C :  I would curve the whole . Like um like it hangs over your hand a little bit .
A :  Oh crap .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Then it will bounce and you don't drop it so easily .
A :  Yeah . Oh .
A :  Anyway , so you want to a little more like this ?
C :  Yeah , something like that , yes .
D :  Uh-huh .
A :  And just s s
C :  Yes , exactly .
A :  Stop the curve here or continue it
C :  I think continue like that .
D :  Yep .
C :  Then there's also enough room for the electronics .
A :  So we have our L_C_D_ screen . Let's see .
A :  In
B :  But it pretty much looks like a banana already . Uh
C :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
C :  Let's make it yellow then . Uh
D :  Perfect .
A :  Bana it's banana vision .
B :  It's fruit . Yeah .
D :  Yeah , it's perfect .
A :  So you have your L_C_D_ screen right here , suppose .
A :  Um that would make
A :  We use the colours now . But
A :  Um
C :  Maybe once we can make a special edition in according with Chiquita .
C :  Have ourselves sponsored .
A :  You got sponsor , now you get a free one with every pack of Chiquita .
C :  Uh but it's a good trade-off for them if they can have their logo on it .
A :  So it would give the buttons here .
B :  Or they can design their own cover .
C :  Mm-hmm . They might wanna be the first ones to uh
B :  We could set up a a marketing uh agreement .
A :  I suppose I suppose we can put um let's see .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Um
C :  Oh , perhaps they can use it .
C :  Or give a special edition uh with with
A :  Uh I suppose we can put the batteries in here because it has the most space , for example .
B :  Won't that be a problem with the L_C_D_ screen ?
A :  I don't think so because it's the biggest part of the uh of the uh
C :  Mm .
B :  Yeah , but the L_C_D_ screen probably needs quite the chip .
A :  Let's
C :  I think this is possible .
A :  I think it's possible . I think it's the best place yeah , you could also put 'em here . But
B :  Okay .
C :  Huh .
C :  It doesn't matter . You can actually uh place a chip for the L_C_D_ screen and at the bottom , and and wire it . Doesn't matter .
A :  Okay , so we put the batteries here .
B :  Okay , that's not a problem . Okay .
D :  Okay .
A :  That's fine .
A :  Yep . Blah .
B :  I think we get the idea .
A :  Um , any other com what what are we missing here ? Something a speech recognition . Um
A :  where do we want the microphone , for example , to be ? On the side or on the or , for example , on top ? Like here .
D :  Top ?
B :  Oh , basically the idea that I had was it to be pretty much in combination with the transmitter . 'Cause you can talk to it like this .
D :  On there .
C :  I think on top .
A :  To be
A :  Okay , I w thought maybe it's either be here or because it's mi it might interfere with the transmitter , I'm not sure . But
D :  No .
A :  'Cause transmitter would be here .
B :  Well , the email said it was a quite a small component . So I don't see that .
A :  Why uh once again , like you said , the component can be somewhere at the bottom while we wire the microphone up there . Anyway .
A :  Um yeah , it could be either be here or make a double microphone .
C :  Mm-hmm .
A :  I wouldn't mind .
D :  .
C :  It is , I believe , also able to talk .
A :  It's able to talk to you .
B :  It's a
C :  I have a sample uh sample sensor and the speaker sensor .
A :  A speaker sensor .
C :  Uh the speaker sensor we already have , but s I don't know what they exactly mean by a sample sensor . Could it talk back ? Like uh g uh give confirmation or something .
C :  I think it can . I think if you have a a speech recognition component , then a s speaking component is not that hard to to put in either .
B :  Well , the
A :  I think so , it I think it could .
A :  Yeah . I mean it could be a all this stuff could be integrated into the L_C_D_ screen , which you could navigate with this , I suppose . Navigate through everything . If you have I think you sh I think the advanced options should be I think it sh the advanced option could also be integrated in the L_C_D_ screen , of course , because you don't have to have a button for everything . You can just navigate through th m your menu that you have here for advanced options with this . Think that would be fine . So that's w m would be making use of the L_C_D_ screen .
D :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm . But
B :  Yeah , but do you actually need the remote talking back ?
C :  Mm-hmm . Yeah .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
D :  .
C :  Mm .
C :  Hmm .
A :  Mm .
C :  We already have a sound component , by the way , for the beep .
C :  So beep .
A :  Beep .
B :  Beep .
D :  Beep .
A :  Um , so the flashing of the beep , we have well anything . We could Yeah , but you could put a speaker or something on on the side for example .
B :  At the back , yeah . Like that . Or at the side .
C :  Hmm .
A :  For how do you draw that again ?
B :  Which is .
A :  Uh whatever , looks stupid .
B :  So what's basically edi the editi idea , sorry , now ? We need to stay here and work out that .
A :  I think this is pretty
C :  I'm not sure . I should be getting new information , I guess .
D :  Oh .
A :  I think you have to stay here because we are supposed to five minutes to finish the meeting . Oh , like my the info that I got was that you're uh we're gonna work on our own because you're gonna do the market market uh analysing I'm supposed to do the little work on the year-end report . So the project report .
D :  Yep .
D :  Okay .
A :  Hmm . Okay , I think we're everybody satisfied with the with the current design we have ? So we're s supposed to be rubber . I think well , I think the the remote control is gonna be black because we we forgot to talk about I mean the the company colours are important apparently . So we have the logo up there . So are we gonna base colour is black ?
B :  Well , I suppose we'll
C :  Yes .
D :  Ah , that's fine .
B :  Pretty much .
D :  Round .
D :  Why ?
C :  But we have
C :  any company logo . We have yes , but and yellow .
A :  And yeah , of course we could use yellow buttons or yellow navigation or whatever .
C :  I would change . I would take a yellow remote control . To have it flashy , to have it it's for young people .
A :  Yellow but yellow control . It's
B :  Yeah , but when you use covers , it basically easier to have a n have a neutral colour on the base .
A :  Okay .
C :  Need do be different .
D :  It's the colour of a
A :  Well , don't don't stick yourself on the covers right now .
A :  But don't stick yourself on the cover because
C :  Hmm .
B :  No , we're designing the remote control now , but taking that into consideration , it's better to have a neutral base colour than to have a flashy
C :  But we need to be different .
A :  Nah .
A :  Yeah , but the info . I think we should go with uh with the company colour because what specific info that I got from the project board . So I think we should go with that .
D :  But , the you
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  The young people want uh a trendy uh remote control . So colourful uh is
A :  They want something trendy .
C :  Huh .
C :  It's either black cover with yellow buttons or vice versa . And I would say take a yellow cover and black buttons .
B :  It is more trendy . That's definitely true .
A :  I think we should th then take it take yellow . Take what you c yellow remote control . So let's see if if we can do the LED onto it .
C :  To be different .
D :  Yeah .
D :  You have the basic colours , blue , green , red .
A :  Uh oh .
C :  Yeah , we have so many colours already .
C :  So
A :  You know what ? I'm not gonna do this . That's up to you guys .
D :  Oh , it's okay .
C :  Oh no , that I think it's good thing to be different than
D :  Yeah . Colourful , you you
A :  You doodle a doodle us a nice nice design for for the next meeting , we'll be done . I think we're all happy now .
C :  Well
C :  Mm-hmm .
D :  Yep .
C :  I still don't have my scroll-wheel though . Uh that's Nah , that's true .
A :  Yeah .
D :  Yeah .
A :  Stupid scroll-wheel .
B :  Oh , where would you like to put it ?
D :  Yeah .
A :  I'm not sure uh I really , I'm no I have no clue what we could use the scroll-wheel for .
B :  Uh you could use it for the channels and for the volume . But it's has no real added value .
C :  No , forget it .
D :  Oh yeah .
C :  No look , it
D :  You can
A :  It takes space , a lot of space . And it could
C :  No , that's not my point . It's not because it's functional , but it's just to add to the design , to have it flashy . It it has no function , I agree . I agree .
D :  Ah may
B :  Yeah , but if it has no function , then
A :  I'm not sure if it if it has no function , why even put it there ? And th that's just so much things that make it look flash
C :  Oh , so many things have no function , just design .
D :  But uh uh scroll for a channel s selection or volume
C :  Mm-hmm . Hmm .
A :  I think channel selection would be annoying because it just c you could scroll past the channel or
C :  Mm-hmm .
C :  Let's vote on it . Then we don't have to talk about it any longer . What do you want ? In or out ?
D :  Oh okay .
A :  Hmm .
D :  Oh okay .
B :  Basically out . I don't see the
C :  Okay . You are out of course . You are okay , clear .
A :  .
D :  Out .
A :  No r no scroll-wheel . Okay . Um I don't see anything missing really . Yeah , we should too bad we don't have the finance . We could've
B :  Do you have all your answers ? Okay .
C :  I have all my answers , yes .
A :  Yeah , it's I'm not sure if we're if we're gonna get finance anyway because I thought we cou I thought it was gonna be an issue at the first time we started . I thought it was gonna be a cost issue which material we were gonna take relative to the advanced chips or anything . So you just do whatever you like and uh doesn't care what it costs .
D :  I have to call this in a form .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm . There is I have one question .
C :  Hmm .
C :  Hmm .
C :  I only have one question with the material , but I don't have information that . We've chosen rubber .
A :  I think we're rubber is not expensive . Definitely .
C :  No , but can we make yellow rubber ? I think so
A :  You can make rubber in any colour . In any colour . So I mean you can't make yellow titanium , but you can make yellow rubber .
B :  Yes , you can colour rubber , yeah .
D :  Ah .
C :  Okay .
D :  But we ha w we don't uh use our reco uh we uh removable cover ? No , huh ?
C :  Mm .
C :  Okay .
A :  Uh yeah we can make uh for example it's just something you can click on it like uh that's but it's not som not apparently that's not something we're working with in the basic design . So .
D :  Maybe maybe later , maybe we can uh
C :  Hmm .
A :  Yeah , it could be . It can be done , for e
