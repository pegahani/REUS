dialogue type : qw
A :  Why is it so cold in here ?

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Well , I had a just a quick question

dialogue type : s
A :  but I know there was discussion of it at a previous meeting that I missed ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but just about the the wish list item of getting good quality close - talking mikes on every speaker .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , we started running recognition on one conversation

dialogue type : s
A :  but it 's the r isn't working yet .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , the main thing would be if anyone has , um , knowledge about ways to , uh , post - process the wave forms that would give us better recognition ,

dialogue type : s
A :  that would be helpful to know about .

dialogue type : h
A :  Ri - um ,

dialogue type : s^aa|%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  And actually in addition to that , that the the close talking mikes are worn in such a way as to best capture the signal .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  And the reason here is just that for the people doing work

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  not on microphones but on sort of like dialogue and so forth ,

dialogue type : h|s.%--
A :  uh or and even on prosody ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  which Don is gonna be working on soon ,

dialogue type : s
A :  it adds this extra , you know , vari variable for each speaker to to deal with when the microphones aren't similar .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  So And I also talked to Mari this morning

dialogue type : s
A :  and she also had a strong preference for doing that .

dialogue type : s
A :  And in fact she said that that 's useful for them to know in starting to collect their data too .

dialogue type : b.%
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  But if we could actually standardize , you know , the the microphones , uh , as much as possible that would be really helpful .

dialogue type : s
A :  But y we could just record these signals separately and time align them with the start of the meeting .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A :  Well , for short term research it 's just there 's just so much effort that would have to be done up front n uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so yeah , uniformity would be great .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well Jane would know more about the transcribers .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  So does the recognizer .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  Even if if you 're talking on someone else 's mike it 's still you w

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  That 's OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Great , great .

dialogue type : s^ba|s^ft
A :  Great , thank you very much .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's makes our job a lot easier .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  You just search for Adam 's voice on each individual microphone , you pretty much know where everybody 's sitting .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right ,

dialogue type : s^aa^r
A :  right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  it seems to me that there 's you know , there are good political reasons for for doing this ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  just getting the data ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  like right now SRI is probably gonna invest a lot of internal funding into recording meetings also , which is good ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um , but they 'll be recording with video

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  You know , it 'd be nice if we can have at least , uh , make use of the data that we 're recording as we go

dialogue type : s^df
A :  since it 's sort of this is the first site that has really collected these really impromptu meetings ,

dialogue type : s
A :  um , and just have this other information available .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A :  So , if we can get the investment in just for the infra infrastructure

dialogue type : %--
A :  and then ,

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A :  save it out

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A :  or have whoever 's interested

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  save that data out ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  transfer it there ,

dialogue type : s
A :  it 'd be g it 'd be good to have have the recording . I think .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^no^rt
A :  I 'm not sure about video .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A :  That 's sort of an video has a little different nature since

dialogue type : s
A :  right n right now we 're all being recorded but we 're not being taped .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  So suppose you can get an array in because there 's some person at Berkeley who 's interested and has some equipment ,

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , and suppose we can as we save it we can , you know , transfer it off to some other place that that holds this this data ,

dialogue type : s
A :  who 's interested ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and even if ICSI it itself isn't .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Um , and it it seems like as long as we can time align the beginning , do we need to mix it with the rest ?

dialogue type : s^no^rt
A :  I don't know .

dialogue type : %--
A :  You know ? The

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A :  I mean it 's just it 's worth considering as sort of

dialogue type : s
A :  once you make the up front investment and can sort of save it out each time , and and not have to worry about the disk space factor , then it mi it might be worth having the data .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^aap
A :  Right , I mean at least they 'd have the data and the transcripts ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Right , I mean , just it 'd be nice if we have more information on the same data .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  You know ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  But it 's if it 's impossible or if it 's a lot of effort then you have to just balance the two ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
A :  Right . Internally ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but I know there is interest from other places that are interested in looking at meeting data and having the video .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^na
A :  Right , that 's true .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  You 're on recor you 're being recorded

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fg
A :  Sorry ,

dialogue type : qy^rt.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  I 'm not familiar with this ATLAS system .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh . Oh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I I think it 's sort of hard just playing the you know , just having played the individual files .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  Uh , it 's pretty hard to follow , especially

dialogue type : s
A :  there are a lot of words that are so reduced phonetically that make sense when you know what the person was saying before .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Actually , are th so are they giving any time markings ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : %-
A :  Actu

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : fh|%--
A :  um , you know ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  yeah ,

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : h|s.%-
A :  OK , so this is a , um ,

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um , I mean , for the SRI front - end , we really need to chop things up into pieces that are f not too huge .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , but second of all , uh in general because some of these channels ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : %--
A :  have a lot of cross - ta

dialogue type : s^bsc
A :  sorry , some of the segments have a lot of cross - talk .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , it 's good to get sort of short segments if you 're gonna do recognition ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  especially forced alignment .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So ,

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , Don has been taking a first stab actually using Jane 's first the fir the meeting that Jane transcribed

dialogue type : s
A :  which we did have some problems with ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and Thilo , uh , I think told me why this was ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  but that people were switching microphones around in the very beginning ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A :  the SRI re

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  So we have to sort of normalize the front - end and so forth , and have these small segments .

dialogue type : s
A :  So we 've taken that and chopped it into pieces based always on your your , um , cuts that you made on the mixed signal .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so that every every speaker has the same cuts .

dialogue type : s
A :  And if they have speech in it we run it through .

dialogue type : s
A :  And if they don't have speech in it we don't run it through .

dialogue type : s
A :  And we base that knowledge on the transcription .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A :  Um , the problem is if we have no time marks ,

dialogue type : s
A :  then for forced alignment we actually don't know where you know , in the signal the transcriber heard that word .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , if if it 's a whole conversation and we get a long , uh , you know , par paragraph of of talk ,

dialogue type : s^no
A :  uh , I don't know how they do this .

dialogue type : fh|s^no
A :  Um , we actually don't know which piece goes where .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s^ng.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  So when Jane transcribes them the way she has transcribers doing this ,

dialogue type : s
A :  whether it 's with the pre - segmentation or not ,

dialogue type : s
A :  they have a chunk and then they transcribes the words in the chunk .

dialogue type : s
A :  And maybe they choose the chunk or now they use a pre - segmentation and then correct it if necessary .

dialogue type : s
A :  But there 's first a chunk and then a transcription .

dialogue type : s
A :  Then a chunk , then a transcription .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  That 's great ,

dialogue type : s^df.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
A :  Right , and it it helps that it 's made based on sort of heuristics and human ear I think .

dialogue type : s
A :  Th - but there 's going to be a real problem ,

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , even if we chop up based on speech silence these , uh , the transcripts from I B M , we don't actually know where the words were ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  which segment they belonged to .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that 's sort of what I 'm worried about right now .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  you can always chop it up

dialogue type : s
A :  but you need to have a reference of which words went with which , uh , chop .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  uh , I don't know , maybe it 's saved out in pieces or or something . That would help .

dialogue type : fh
A :  But ,

dialogue type : s^no
A :  uh , it 's just an unknown right now .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Right . But the it is true that the segments I haven't tried the segments that Thilo gave you

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  but the segments that in your first meeting are great .

dialogue type : s^ba^e
A :  I mean , that 's that 's a good length .

dialogue type : fg|%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  y yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  I mean , the the more data we have to try the the alignments on , um , the better .

dialogue type : s
A :  So it 'd be good for just to know as transcriptions are coming through the pipeline from the transcribers ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  just to sort of we 're playing around with sort of uh , parameters f on the recognizer ,

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  cuz that would be helpful .

dialogue type : s
A :  Especially as you get , en more voices .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  The first meeting had I think just four people ,

dialogue type : b
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , great ,

dialogue type : s^bk^r
A :  great .

dialogue type : b
A :  So .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
A :  So this is like gestural uh , these g

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^rt.%--
A :  But is is the goal there to have this on meeting data ,

dialogue type : %--
A :  like

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
A :  so that you can do far field studies of those gestures

dialogue type : fh
A :  or um ,

dialogue type : qrr^rt
A :  or is it because you think there 's a different kind of actual production in meetings that people use ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
A :  Or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^ba
A :  Right . Yeah , that would be good .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  That 's true .

dialogue type : s^rt^tc
A :  I guess I wanted to , um , sort of make a pitch for trying to collect more meetings .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I actually I talked to Chuck Fillmore

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  and I think they 've what , vehemently said no before

dialogue type : s:s^co
A :  but this time he wasn't vehement and he said you know , " well , Liz , come to the meeting tomorrow

dialogue type : s
A :  and try to convince people " .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I 'm gonna try . Go to their meeting tomorrow

dialogue type : s
A :  and see if we can try , uh , to convince them

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  And they have very interesting meetings from the point of view of a very different type of of talk than we have here

dialogue type : s
A :  and definitely than the front end meeting , probably .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^aap|s^rt
A :  Well , yes and in terms of the the fact that they 're describing abstract things

dialogue type : s
A :  and , uh , just dialogue - wise ,

dialogue type : s^f
A :  right .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  Um , so I 'll try .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  And then the other thing is ,

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  I don't know if this is at all useful ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  but I asked Lila if I can maybe go around and talk to the different departments in this building

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  to see if there 's any groups that , for a free lunch ,

dialogue type : s
A :  if we can still offer that ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  non - ICSI , non - academic ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  you know , like government people ,

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  I don't know .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  Is is it in these departments ?

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
A :  Right , and then we could also we might try advertising again

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because I think it 'd be good if if we can get a few different sort of non - internal types of meetings

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and just also more data .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I actually wrote to him and he answered , " great , that sounds really interesting " .

dialogue type : s
A :  But I never heard back

dialogue type : s
A :  because we didn't actually advertise openly .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  We a I mean w

dialogue type : s
A :  I told I d asked him privately .

dialogue type : s
A :  Um , and it is a little bit of a trek for campus folks .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
A :  Um , so it 's still worthwhile .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Exactly ,

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
A :  Plus we could also get you know , a s a student .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
A :  And I 'm willing to try to learn .

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  I mean , I 'm I would do my best .

dialogue type : s
A :  Um , the other thing is that there was a number of things at the transcription side that , um , transcribers can do , like dialogue act tagging ,

dialogue type : s
A :  disfluency tagging ,

dialogue type : s
A :  um , things that are in the speech that are actually something we 're y working on for language modeling .

dialogue type : s
A :  And Mari 's also interested in it ,

dialogue type : s
A :  Andreas as well .

dialogue type : s
A :  So if you wanna process a utterance and the first thing they say is , " well " , and that " well " is coded as some kind of interrupt u tag .

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , and things like that ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  um ,

dialogue type : %-
A :  th

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^ba|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I think there 's a second pass

dialogue type : s
A :  and I don't really know what would exist in it .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  But there 's definitely a second pass worth doing to maybe encode some kinds of , you know , is it a question or not ,

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  um , that maybe these transcribers could do .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  That 'd be great .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bk^m
A :  Oh , that we could .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I thought that all these people had sort of said " no " twice already .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Right . That was a big fear .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
A :  Yeah , I mean , it One thing that would be nice

dialogue type : s^bd^df
A :  and this it sounds bizarre

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  but , I 'd really like to look at to get some meetings where there 's a little bit of heated discussion ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
A :  like ar arguments and or emotion , and things like that .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so I was thinking if there 's any like Berkeley political groups or something .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  I mean , that 'd be perfect .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  Some group , " yes , we must "

dialogue type : s^nd.%-
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fg
A :  Well , OK .

dialogue type : s^cs^nd
A :  No , but maybe stu student , uh , groups or , um , film - makers , or som Something a little bit colorful .

dialogue type : s
A :  And I don't mean that they 're angry

dialogue type : s^ba^cs
A :  but just something with some more variation in prosodic contours and so forth would be neat .

dialogue type : s
A :  So if anyone has ideas ,

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  I 'm willing to do the leg work to go try to talk to people

dialogue type : s
A :  but I don't really know which groups are worth pursuing .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^am
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b
A :  mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
A :  something where there there is actually discussion where there 's no right or wrong answer but but it 's a matter of opinion kind of thing .

dialogue type : fh|s^t
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'm I 'm actually serious

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because , uh , you know , we have the set up here

dialogue type : s
A :  and and that that has a chance to give us some very interesting fun data .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So

dialogue type : s
A :  if anyone has ideas ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  if you know any groups that are m you know ,

dialogue type : s
A :  student groups c like clubs , things like that .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^j:s
A :  " If you 're really angry at someone use our conference room . "

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : qh
A :  Really .

dialogue type : s^2.%-
A :  Or people who are really h

dialogue type : s^j^ng
A :  Well , far field mikes can pick up where they threw stuff on the wall .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Oh . Yeah , right .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I I already asked Thilo

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  but that , um , it would be helpful if I can stay in the loop somehow with , um , people who are doing any kind of post - processing ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  whether it 's to separate speakers or to improve the signal - to - noise ratio , or both ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  um , that we can sort of try out as we 're running recognition .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A :  Um , so , i is that Who else is work

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
A :  I guess Dan Ellis and you

dialogue type : s^bk^m
A :  and Dave .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  It doesn't seem like big room acoustics problems to my ear

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but I 'm not an expert .

dialogue type : s
A :  It seems like a problem with cross - talk .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  That that may be true .

dialogue type : s^no
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  That 's true .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  Oh , I don't know .

dialogue type : s^bs
A :  All I meant is just that as sort of as this pipeline of research is going on we 're also experimenting with different ASR , uh , techniques .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  And so it 'd be w good to know about it .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
A :  R right , although if they 're not talking , using the the inhouse transcriptions , were sort of O K

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because the t no one transcribed any words there

dialogue type : s
A :  and we throw it out .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  But if they 're talking at all and they 're not talking the whole time ,

dialogue type : s:s
A :  so you get some speech and then a " mm - hmm " , and some more speech ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  so that whole thing is one chunk .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the person in the middle who said only a little bit is picking up the speech around it ,

dialogue type : s
A :  that 's where it 's a big problem .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  The energy ,

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  right . Exactly .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well we try to find as close of start and end time of as we can to the speech from an individual speaker ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  for the forced alignment which is just to give us the time boundaries ,

dialogue type : s
A :  because from those time boundaries then the plan is to compute prosodic features .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the sort of more space you have that isn't the thing you 're trying to align the more errors we have .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A :  Um , so , you know , that that it would help to have either pre - processing of a signal that creates very good signal - to - noise ratio ,

dialogue type : s^no
A :  which I don't know how possible this is for the lapel ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um , or to have very to have closer , um , time you know , synch times , basically , around the speech

dialogue type : s
A :  that gets transcribed in it , or both .

dialogue type : s
A :  And it 's just sort of a open world right now of exploring that .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  So I just wanted to see , you know , on the transcribing end from here things look good .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Uh , the IBM one is more it 's an open question right now .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then the issue of like global processing of some signal

dialogue type : s
A :  and then , you know , before we chop it up is is yet another way we can improve things in that .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  when the signal - to - noise ratio is too low , um , you you 'll get , a uh an alignment with the wrong duration pattern

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^na.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , what he did is allow you to have , uh , words that were in another segment move over to the at the edges of of segmentations .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  cuz what they had done there is align and then chop .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , and this problem is a little bit j more global .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  It 's that there are problems even in inside the alignments ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  uh , because of the fact that there 's enough acoustic signal there t for the recognizer to to eat , as part of a word .

dialogue type : s
A :  And it tends to do that .

dialogue type : %-
A :  S

dialogue type : fh
A :  So , uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but we probably will have to do something like that in addition .

dialogue type : fh|s^bs
A :  Anyway . So , yeah , bottom bottom line is just I wanted to make sure I can be aware of whoever 's working on these signal - processing techniques for , uh , detecting energies ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because that that 'll really help us .
