dialogue type : s^ar|s
F :  No , actually I I have to I have to shuttle kids from various places to various other places .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  And I don't have and I don't , um , have a cell phone

dialogue type : s
F :  so I can't be having a conference call while driving .

dialogue type : s
F :  Plus , it would make for interesting noise background noise .

dialogue type : fh

dialogue type : s^aa^j

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^j
F :  I let , uh , my five - year - old have a try at the digits ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  eh .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Exactly .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  D do the lapel mikes have any directionality to them ?

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  It

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Di - did I send you some results without adaptation ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Yeah , I think I did , actually .

dialogue type : s
F :  So there was a significant loss from not doing the adaptation .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  A a a couple percent or some

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^no
F :  Uh , I I don't remember ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but there was there was a significant , um , loss or win from adaptation with with adaptation .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  that was the phone - loop adaptation .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then there was a very small like point one percent on the natives uh , win from doing , um , you know , adaptation to the recognition hypotheses .

dialogue type : s
F :  And I tried both means adaptation and means and variances ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and the variances added another or subtracted another point one percent .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , it 's , um that 's the number there .

dialogue type : s
F :  Point six , I believe , is what you get with both , uh , means and variance adaptation .

dialogue type : qw^br
F :  This exact same recognizer ?

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No .

dialogue type : s
F :  But but , I have I mean , people people at SRI are actually working on digits .

dialogue type : s
F :  I could and they are using a system that 's , um you know , h is actually trained on digits ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  um , but h h otherwise uses the same , you know , decoder , the same , uh , training methods , and so forth ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  and I could ask them what they get on TI - digits .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , Adam knows how to run it ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  so you just make a f

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b.%

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Well .

dialogue type : s
F :  But remember , we 're using a telephone bandwidth front - end here , uh , on this , uh on this SRI system ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so , um , I was I thought that maybe that 's actually a good thing

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  because it it gets rid of some of the uh , the noises ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  um , you know , in the the below and above the um , the , you know , speech bandwidth

dialogue type : fh
F :  and , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I suspect that to get sort of the last bit out of these higher - quality recordings you would have to in fact , uh , use models that , uh , were trained on wider - band data .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's it 's easy enough to try ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  one issue with with that is that um , the system has this , uh , notion of a speaker to which is used in adaptation , variance norm uh , you know , both in , uh , mean and variance normalization

dialogue type : s
F :  and also in the VTL estimation .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : %-
F :  Do y ?

dialogue type : %-
F :  Is ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  So does so th so does does , um , the TI - digits database have speakers that are known ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  And is there is there enough data or a comparable comparable amount of data to to what we have in our recordings here ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df^ng
F :  Right . Uh , but I 'm not so much worried about the adaptation , actually , than than the , um , um the , uh , VTL estimation .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  If you have only one utterance per speaker you might actually screw up on estimating the the warping , uh , factor .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^nd
F :  Right . But it 's not the amount of speakers ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  it 's the num it 's the amount of data per speaker .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  So th the system actually extracts the speaker ID from the waveform names .

dialogue type : s
F :  And there 's a there 's a script and that is actually all in one script .

dialogue type : s
F :  So there 's this one script that parses waveform names

dialogue type : s
F :  and extracts things like the , um , speaker , uh , ID

dialogue type : s^e
F :  or something that can stand in as a speaker ID .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So , we might have to modify that script to recognize the , um , speakers , um , in the in the , uh , um , TI - digits database .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Or you can fake you can fake names for these waveforms that resemble the names that we use here for the for the meetings .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  By the way , I think we can improve these numbers if we care to compr improve them by , um , not starting with the Switchboard models but by taking the Switchboard models and doing supervised adaptation on a small amount of digit data collected in this setting .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because that would adapt your models to the room acoustics

dialogue type : s^df^e
F :  and f for the far - field microphones , you know , to the noise .

dialogue type : s
F :  And that should really improve things , um , further .

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  use that as the starting models for your speaker adaptation .

dialogue type : s^ng^no
F :  Well , I don't know .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  Um , but , you know , I uh , my impression was that you were actually interested in the far - field microphone , uh , problem ,

dialogue type : %--
F :  I mean .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So ,

dialogue type : s
F :  you want to you want to That 's the obvious thing to try .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  That 's where the most m acoustic mismatch is between the currently used models and the the r the set up here .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qh^bk.%
F :  It is ?

dialogue type : fh.%
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I I already adjusted this a number of times .

dialogue type : %-
F :  I I

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yeah , I think this contraption around your head is not working so well .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , basically your ears are too big .

dialogue type : s^bd
F :  I mean , mine are too .

dialogue type : s^bd^e
F :  E th everybody 's ears are too big for these things .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : qw^rt.%-
F :  What k u By the way , wh what factor of two did you ?

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , th OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  That factor of two .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  You want to probably choose the PZM channel that is closest to the speaker .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw
F :  So so , but where is this now ?

dialogue type : qw^e
F :  I mean , what 's where do we go from here ?

dialogue type : %--
F :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s
F :  we so we have a we have a a system that works pretty well

dialogue type : s
F :  but it 's not , you know , the system that people here are used to using to working with .

dialogue type : qw
F :  So what what do we do now ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK . Alright .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  So so the key thing that 's missing here is basically the ability to feed , you know , other features i into the recognizer

dialogue type : s^bu^e
F :  and also then to train the system .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  And , uh , es I don't know when Chuck will be back

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  So , I think that 's one of the things that he said he would be working on .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s
F :  Just sort of t to make sure that we can do that

dialogue type : fh
F :  and Um .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's uh , I mean , the the front - end is f i tha that 's in the SRI recognizer is very nice in that it does a lot of things on the fly

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but it unfortunately is not designed and , um like the , uh , ICSI system is , where you can feed it from a pipeline of of the command .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  you know , if you want to use some new features , you have to dump them into individual files

dialogue type : s
F :  and give those files to the recognizer .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Alright .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , the the the cumbersome thing is is , um is that you actually have to dump out little little files .

dialogue type : s
F :  So for each segment that you want to recognize you have to dump out a separate file .

dialogue type : s
F :  Just like i th like th as if there were these waveform segments ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but instead you have sort of feature file segments .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  So that 's actually interesting .

dialogue type : s
F :  The pruning was the same value that we used for recognition .

dialogue type : s
F :  And we had lowered that we had used tighter pruning after Liz ran some experiments showing that , you know , it runs slower

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  So for free recognition , this the lower pruning value is better .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Correct .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Um , but it turned out for for to get accurate alignments it was really important to open up the pruning significantly .

dialogue type : fh|s^df
F :  Um because otherwise it would sort of do greedy alignment , um , in regions where there was no real speech yet from the foreground speaker .

dialogue type : s
F :  Um , so that was one big factor that helped improve things

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  and then the other thing was that ,

dialogue type : s
F :  you know , as Liz said the we f enforce the fact that , uh , the foreground speech has to be continuous .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  It cannot be you cannot have a background speech hypothesis in the middle of the foreground speech .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  You can only have background speech at the beginning and the end .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : fg|%-
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  so we have a reject phone .

dialogue type : s
F :  And you and what we wanted to try with you know , once we have this paper written and have a little more time , uh , t cloning that reject model

dialogue type : s
F :  and then one copy of it would be adapted to the foreground speaker to capture the rejects in the foreground ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  like fragments and stuff ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and the other copy would be adapted to the background speaker .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No .

dialogue type : %-
F :  We w

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  We it 's straightforward to actually just have a a penalty that doesn't completely disallows it but discourages it .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  But , um , we just didn't have time to play with , you know , tuning yet another yet another parameter .

dialogue type : s
F :  And really the reason we can't do it is just that we don't have a we don't have ground truth for these .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So , we would need a hand - marked , um , word - level alignments

dialogue type : s^cs^e
F :  or at least sort of the boundaries of the speech betw you know , between the speakers .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Um , and then use that as a reference

dialogue type : s
F :  and tune the parameters of the of the model , uh , to op to get the best performance .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  We don't care what what tool you use .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , whatever you use .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , we convert it to this format that the , um , NIST scoring tool unders uh , CTM . Conversation Time - Marked file .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  Actually , not randomly .

dialogue type : s^df
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Well ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s
F :  No . I think it 's actually I think what 's going on is backchannelling is something that happens in two - party conversations .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  And if you ask someone a question , you essentially initiating a little two - party conversation .

dialogue type : s
F :  So then you 're so and then you 're expected to backchannel

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because the person is addressing you directly and not everybody .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  And

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's the it 's the spurt format .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : %-
F :  So s

dialogue type : %-
F :  W uh , w

dialogue type : %-
F :  We

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bd^df
F :  uh , this this is just maybe someone has s some some ideas about how to do it better ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but we So we 're taking these , uh , alignments from the individual channels .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  from each alignment we 're producing , uh , one of these CTM files ,

dialogue type : s
F :  which essentially has it 's just a linear sequence of words with the begin times for every word and the duration .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  Right . But it has one the first column has the meeting name ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so it could actually contain several meetings .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s
F :  And the second column is the channel .

dialogue type : s
F :  Third column is the , um , start times of the words and the fourth column is the duration of the words .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  And then we 're ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  OK . Then we have a messy alignment process where we actually insert into the sequence of words the , uh , tags

dialogue type : s^e
F :  for , like , where where sentence ends of sentence ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  question marks ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
F :  um , various other things .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  So so those are actually sort of retro - fitted into the time alignment .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then we merge all the alignments from the various channels

dialogue type : s
F :  and we sort them by time .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then there 's a then there 's a process where you now determine the spurts .

dialogue type : s
F :  That is Actually , no , you do that before you merge the various channels .

dialogue type : s
F :  So you you id identify by some criterion ,

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  you identify the beginnings and ends of these spurts ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and you put another set of tags in there to keep those straight .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then you merge everything in terms of , you know , linearizing the sequence based on the time marks .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then you extract the individual channels again ,

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  you know , where their spurts start and end .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so you extract the individual channels , uh , one sp spurt by spurt as it were .

dialogue type : s
F :  Um , and inside the words or between the words you now have begin and end tags for overlaps .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , you you basically have everything sort of lined up and in a form where you can look at the individual speakers and how their speech relates to the other speakers ' speech .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , there 's lots of little things .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's like there 're twelve different scripts which you run

dialogue type : s
F :  and then at the end you have what you want .

dialogue type : fh
F :  But , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  at the very last stage we throw away the actual time information .

dialogue type : s
F :  All we care about is whether that there 's a certain word was overlapped by someone else 's word .

dialogue type : s
F :  So you sort of at that point , you discretize things into just having overlap or no overlap .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because we figure that 's about the level of analysis that we want to do for this paper .

dialogue type : s:qw
F :  But if you wanted to do a more fine - grained analysis and say , you know , how far into the word is the overlap , you could do that .
