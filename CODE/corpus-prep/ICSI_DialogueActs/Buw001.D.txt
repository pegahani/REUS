dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Uh , OK .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt^t^tc
D :  So are we recording now ?

dialogue type : qy^e.%-
D :  Is this

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  Oh ! We 're we 're we 're live .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|qw^t
D :  So , uh , what were we gonna talk about again ?

dialogue type : s^t
D :  So we said we said data collection , which we 're doing .

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's not that long .

dialogue type : %-
D :  w u

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  Oh , yeah , the element ,

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs
D :  yeah , n should be as close to you your mouth as possible .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
D :  So what we had was that we were gonna talk about data collection ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and , um , uh , you you put up there data format ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and other tasks during data collection ,

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^t^tc
D :  I just realized we skipped the part that we were saying we were gonna do at

dialogue type : s^m^na
D :  Roll call .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd.%--
D :  No , not a

dialogue type : s^ar|s^df
D :  No , I just My mind went elsewhere .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So ,

dialogue type : s^aa|s^rt
D :  uh , yeah , I 'm Morgan ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  and

dialogue type : qw^t1
D :  where am I ?

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'm on channel three .

dialogue type : s^j.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , I mean , suppose we broaden out and go to a range of meetings besides just these internal ones .

dialogue type : s
D :  There 's gonna be lots of things that any group of people who know each other have in column common that we will not know .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , we we were originally gonna do this with VLSI design ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and and and the reason we didn't go straight to that was because immediately ninety percent of what we heard would be jargon to to us .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  That that 's right .

dialogue type : s
D :  There were others of course .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%
D :  We can go back .

dialogue type : s
D :  There 's there 's another problem

dialogue type : s
D :  which is , um , we certainly do want to branch out beyond , uh , uh , recording meetings about Meeting Recorder .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , uh , once we get out beyond our little group , the people 's motivation factor , uh , reduces enormously .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  And if we start giving them a bunch of other things to do ,

dialogue type : s
D :  how you know , we we did n you know another meeting here for another group

dialogue type : s
D :  and and , uh , they were fine with it .

dialogue type : qh^df.%-
D :  But if we 'd said , " OK , now all eight of you have to have to come up with , uh , the summar "

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  t See ?

dialogue type : s
D :  There we go .

dialogue type : %-
D :  I

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'm worried that if you did even if you did push them into it , it it it might be semi - random ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  uh , as opposed to what you 'd really want to know if you were gonna use this thing .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Well , I think that we I mean , the the f the core thing is that you know once we get some of these issues nailed down , we need to do a bunch of recordings

dialogue type : s^cs^e
D :  and send them off to IBM

dialogue type : s
D :  and get a bunch of transcriptions

dialogue type : s^e
D :  even if they 're slightly flawed

dialogue type : s^e.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  And then we 'll have some data there .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then , i i we can start l looking and thinking , what do we want to know about these things

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and at the very least .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  That 's a good idea

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^bd^df
D :  Maybe I 'm missing something ,

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
D :  but that doesn't get to the question of how we come up with queries , right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  That that 's what I mean , is that I think it gets at something interesting

dialogue type : s^df
D :  but if we were asking the question , which I thought we were , of of of , um , " how do we figure out what 's the nature of the queries that people are gonna want to ask of such a system ? " , knowing what 's important doesn't tell you what people are going to be asking .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  Does it ?

dialogue type : s^am
D :  Maybe .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^df
D :  Yeah , but we 're just looking for a place to start with that

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because , you know , th what what what James is gonna be doing is looking at the user - interface

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  i We we have five hours of pilot data of the other stuff

dialogue type : s
D :  but we have zero hours of of of queries .

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  So he 's just sort of going " where where do I where do I start ? "

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  now I 'm thinking that the summary a summary , uh , is actually a reasonable , uh , bootstrap into this into what we 'd like to get at .

dialogue type : s^ba^bd
D :  It 's it 's not ideal ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  but we you know , we we have to get started someplace .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  w We have this collection of meeting .

dialogue type : s
D :  We have five hours of stuff .

dialogue type : s
D :  Uh , we get that transcribed .

dialogue type : s
D :  So now we have five hours of meetings

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  and , uh , you ask me , uh , uh , " Morgan , what d you know , what kind of questions do you want to ask ? "

dialogue type : s^no
D :  Uh , I wouldn't have any idea what kind of questions I want to ask .

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'd have to get started someplace .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  So in fact if I looked at summary of it , I 'd go " oh , yeah , I was in that meeting ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  I remember that ,

dialogue type : s.%--:qw.%--
D :  um , what was the part that "

dialogue type : s
D :  And and th I think that might then help me to think of things even things that aren't listed in the summary , but just as a as a as a refresh of what the general thing was going on in the meeting .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Well , yeah . That 's true too .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
D :  A

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^df
D :  you can correct me on this ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but but , uh , my impression was that , uh , pretty much , uh , true that the meetings here , nobody sits with a w uh , with a laptop

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : %-
D :  I

dialogue type : s^aa|s^bd
D :  Yeah , but those are bigger deal things .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  Where you 've got fifteen peo

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  th this is one of the larger meetings .

dialogue type : s
D :  Most of the meetings we have are four or five people

dialogue type : s
D :  and you 're not you don't have somebody sitting and taking minutes for it .

dialogue type : s
D :  You just get together and talk about where you are .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy
D :  Do they ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D :  Li

dialogue type : %-
D :  uh , L L

D :  L

D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  uh , on you on the subcommittee meeting for for at the , uh that workshop we were at that , uh , uh , Mark Liberman was was having .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  So I I wasn't there .

dialogue type : s
D :  They they they they h must have had some discussion about video and the visual aspect , and all that .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  So so to address what what Adam 's saying ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  I mean , I think you uh , that

dialogue type : s
D :  the key thing there is that this is a description of database collection effort that they 're talking about doing .

dialogue type : s
D :  And if the database exists and includes some visual information that doesn't mean that an individual researcher is going to make any use of it .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  So we 're gonna do what we 're gonna do ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  whatever 's reasonable for us .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , minimally , I mean , what what Dan is referring to at least having some representation of the p the spatial position of the people ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  cuz we are interested in some spatial processing .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Great idea .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  Well , I think for I mean , for our purposes we probably will d

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  we we might try that some

dialogue type : s
D :  and and we certainly already have some recordings that don't have that ,

dialogue type : s
D :  uh , which , you know , we we 'll we 'll get other value out of , I think .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  There you go .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think at the moment we should be determining this on the basis of our own , uh , interests and needs rather than hypothetical ones from a community thing .

dialogue type : s
D :  As you say , if they if they decide it 's really critical then they will collect a lot more data than we can afford to ,

dialogue type : s
D :  uh , and and will include all that .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I I I 'm not worried about the cost of setting it up .

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'm worried about the cost of people looking at it .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  In other words , it 's it it 'd be kind of silly to collect it all and not look at it at all .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  And so I I I think that we do have to do some picking and choosing of the stuff that we 're doing .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  But I I am int I do think that we m minimally want something we might want to look at at some some , uh , subsets of that .

dialogue type : s^cs^e
D :  Like for a meeting like this , at least , uh , take a Polaroid of the of the of the boards ,

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : %-
D :  a

dialogue type : s^cs
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
D : 

dialogue type : s^t^tc
D :  So , I mean , departing for the moment from the data collection question but actually talking about , you know , this group and what we actually want to do ,

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
D :  uh , so I guess that 's th the way what you were figuring on doing was was was , uh , putting together some notes and sending them to to everybody

dialogue type : s^e
D :  from from today ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^t
D :  So so the question that that we started with was whether there was anything else we should do during during th during the collection .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I guess the CrossPads was certainly one idea ,

dialogue type : s
D :  uh , and we 'll get them from him and we 'll just do that .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  And then the next thing we talked about was the was the summaries

dialogue type : qh
D :  and are we gonna do anything about that .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I guess the point was to try again , to try to collect more information that could be useful later for for the UI stuff .

dialogue type : s
D :  So it 's sort of Landay supplying it

dialogue type : s
D :  so that Landay 's stuff can be easier to do .

dialogue type : s
D :  So it it Right now he 's g operating from zero ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
D :  and so even if we didn't get it done from UW , it seems like that would could still You shou

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  I mean , at least try it .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I guess a lot of the stuff we 're doing now really is pilot

dialogue type : s^e
D :  in one sense or another .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  And so we try it out and see how it works .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  So who who does this summarization ?

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D :  Ru

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , I think it 's like the note - taking thing ,

dialogue type : s
D :  that that y that you can't certainly can't require it

dialogue type : s^e
D :  or people aren't gonna want to do this .

dialogue type : s
D :  But but if there 's some cases where they will , then it would be helpful .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  The fl the fluorescent light is flickering .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , you still wanted to talk with Liz .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  And you and I need to

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  Oh , oh . You already did the Liz talk .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'm at your disposal .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , up to you .

dialogue type : h|s
D :  Um , I think we should be able to wind up in another half - hour or something ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  you think ?

dialogue type : qw^br
D :  Less ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , I mean , we still haven't talked about the action items from here and so on .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^arp
D :  Yeah , well there 's gonna be these student projects that can do some things

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  but it can't be , yeah , very deep .

dialogue type : s
D :  u I I actually think that that , uh , again , just as a bootstrap , if we do have something like summaries , then having the people who are involved in the meetings themselves , who are cooperative and willing to do yet more , come up with with with queries , uh , could at least give give Landay an idea of the kind of things that people might want to know .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  I mean , ye

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^am
D :  Maybe .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  I would think that would be the most likely thing .

dialogue type : s^t3
D :  Hey .

dialogue type : s^aa^t3
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's gonna take some thought .

dialogue type : %--
D :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s
D :  It seemed The kind of , uh , interest that I had in this thing initially was , uh , that i basically the form that you 're doing something else later ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and you want to pick up something from this meeting related to the something else .

dialogue type : s
D :  So it 's really the imp the the list of what 's important 's in the something else

dialogue type : s^e.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  And it might be something minor of minor importance to the meeting .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Uh , in fact if if it was really major , if it 's the thing that really stuck in your head , then you might not need to go back and and and check on it even .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s:s
D :  Say I I said " well , I wasn't that much interested in dialogue ,

dialogue type : s^e:s
D :  I 'm more of an acoustics person " .

dialogue type : s^e:qw
D :  But but thr three months from now if for some reason I get really interested in dialogue , and I 'm " well what is what was that part that that that , uh , Mari was saying ? "

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then I 'm trying to fi I mean , that 's that 's when I look in general when I look things up most , is when it 's something that didn't really stick in my head the first time around

dialogue type : s
D :  and but for some new reason I 'm I 'm I 'm interested in in in the old stuff .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  So , I don't I don't know .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I was concerned about , uh , being interested in something later that w uh , I didn't consider to be important the first time ,

dialogue type : s
D :  which for me is actually the dominant thing ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because if I thought it was really important it tends to stick more than if I didn't ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but some new task comes along that makes me want to look up .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs
D :  Yeah . So having multiple people might get at some of that .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Yeah , and this is a starting point .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
D :  W

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , irreversible .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  I I I mean , I guess what I what I I keep coming back to in my own mind is that , um , the soonest we can do it , we need to get up some kind of system

dialogue type : s
D :  so that people who 've been involved in the meeting can go back later ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  even if it 's a poor system in some ways ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and , uh and ask the questions that they actually want to know .

dialogue type : s
D :  If you know , if uh , as soon as we can get that going at any kind of level , then I think we 'll have a much better handle on what kind of questions people want to ask than in any anything we do before that .

dialogue type : s
D :  But obviously we have to bootstrap somehow ,

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk

D : 

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^ng^no
D :  I I 'm not so sure I agree with that .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because uh , b because it depends on , uh , what our goal is .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  If our goal is Wizard of Oz - ish ,

dialogue type : s
D :  we might want to know what is it that people would really like to know about this data .

dialogue type : s
D :  And if it 's if if it 's something that we don't know how to do yet , th great ,

dialogue type : s
D :  that 's , you know , research project for year four or something .

dialogue type : s^f
D :  You know ?

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^bd^cs
D :  well , not maybe not true Wizard of Oz

dialogue type : s^df.%-

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  We we had I mean ,

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : qy
D :  but I guess Did y did you get enough milestone , uh , from the description things ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , you know , there 's obviously detail behind each of those , as much as is needed .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , you just have to let us know .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s.%-

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^aa|s^m^na
D :  Yeah , foot foot pedals

dialogue type : fh

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s|s.%-
D :  No , I mean , it 'll be

dialogue type : s^e^rt
D :  probably about like you did ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and then there will be some things you know , many things that don't work out well .

dialogue type : s
D :  And that 'll go back to IBM

dialogue type : s
D :  and they 'll they 'll , uh they run their aligner on it

dialogue type : s
D :  and it kicks out things that don't work well ,

dialogue type : s
D :  which you know , the overlaps will certainly be examples of that .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  I mean , what w we will give them all of it . Right ?

dialogue type : s^e
D :  We 'll give them all the the multi - channel stuff

dialogue type : %-

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba
D :  Yeah . Good idea .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's also won't be adding much to the data to give them the mixed .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  Right . And I was gonna m email them the which I haven't yet , a pointer to to the web pages that we that we currently have ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  cuz in particular they want to see the one with the the way the recording room is set up

dialogue type : s
