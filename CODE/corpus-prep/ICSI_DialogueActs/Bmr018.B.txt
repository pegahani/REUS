dialogue type : z
B :  When the power went out the other day and I restarted it , it crashed the first time .

dialogue type : z
B :  After the power out

dialogue type : z
B :  Well this wasn't Actually , this wasn't a before your meeting , this was , um , Tuesday afternoon when , um , uh , Robert just wanted to do a little recording ,

dialogue type : z
B :  and the power had gone out earlier in the day .

dialogue type : z
B :  Talk about a good noise shield .

dialogue type : z
B :  You know ?

dialogue type : z
B :  You wanted to pe keep people from listening in , you could like have that playing outside the room .

dialogue type : z
B :  Nobody could listen in .

dialogue type : z
B :  And then we 'll we 'll go back later and review the individual channels ,

dialogue type : z
B :  right ?

dialogue type : z
B : 

dialogue type : z
B :  Practically , huh .

dialogue type : z
B :  With all the overlaps .

dialogue type : s^t
B :  I wouldn't mind hearing how the conference was .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes ,

dialogue type : h
B :  um ,

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  he 's I I 'm sorry , I should have forwarded that along .

dialogue type : fh|sj
B :  Uh , oh I I think I mentioned at the last meeting ,

dialogue type : s
B :  he said that , um , he talked to them

dialogue type : s
B :  and it was fine with the beeps

dialogue type : s
B :  they would be That 's easy for them to do .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well for this experiment I think we can use pre pretty much anything .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Well we 've talked about that as being the next ones we wanted to transcribe .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  But for the purpose of sending him a sample one to f

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  I I don't think it matte

dialogue type : fh|s^co
B :  Right , so we need to run Thilo 's thing on it ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then we go in and adjust the boundaries .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  And we probably don't have to do necessarily a whole meeting for that if we just wanna send them a sample to try .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B :  maybe we can figure out how long it 'll take @ @ to to do .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I guess , the only thing I 'm not sure about is , um ,

dialogue type : qw
B :  how quickly can the transcribers scan over and fix the boundaries ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  I mean , is it pretty easy ?

dialogue type : qw^bu^rt
B :  As of what point ?

dialogue type : %--
B :  I mean .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  The I guess the question on my mind is do we wait for the transcribers to adjust the marks for the whole meeting before we give anything to IBM ,

dialogue type : qrr
B :  or do we go ahead and send them a sample ?

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^no
B :  Well I I I mean , I don't know .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Uh . That I agree .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
B :  I agree .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  We 're just doing the individual channels ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So it 's gonna be , depending on the number of people in the meeting ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I don't see how that will work , though .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's that 's what I 'm I 'm concerned about the part .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Can't we uh couldn't we just have , um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I don't know , maybe this just doesn't fit with the software ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  but I guess if I didn't know anything about Transcriber and I was gonna make something to let them adjust boundaries , I would just show them one channel at a time , with the marks , and let them adju

dialogue type : s
B :  But i but it 's very quick ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , you scan I mean , if you have a display of the waveform .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Did you run the Andreas the r SRI recognizer on the digits ?

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  Zero percent error ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  This is error you 're talking about ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qrr^bu^d.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , so I was curious about that .

dialogue type : sj^ng
B :  I didn't think that his message said it wasn't straight - forward .

dialogue type : sj^bu
B :  I thought he 's just saying you have to look over a longer time window when you do it .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Right .

dialogue type : sj^cs
B :  So you just have to look over longer time when you 're trying to align the things ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Well , Andreas , how well did it work on the non - lapel stuff ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Because really the the at least in terms of how we were gonna use this in our system was to get an ideal an idea , uh , for each channel about the start and end boundaries .

dialogue type : s
B :  We don't really care about like intermediate word boundaries ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right , exactly .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I mean , maybe if it doesn't work for lapel stuff , we can just not use that

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : qh
B :  We c you know what ?

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Maybe the best way to find that would be to look through these .

dialogue type : s^df^rt
B :  Cuz you can see the seat numbers ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then you can see what type of mike they were using .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  What what is why do you need the , um , the forced alignment for the HLT I mean for the Eurospeech paper ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So it was to get it was to get more data and better to to squeeze the boundaries in .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Ah , OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , we were never just gonna go with these as the final alignments .

dialogue type : s
B :  We were always gonna run them past somebody .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Could you could you at the same time adapt the reject model to the speech from all the other channels ?

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  Oh , not just the speech from that of the other people from that channel ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but the speech from the a actual other channels .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Actually if if you have a larger head , that mike 's gotta go farther away which means the the balance is gonna make it wanna tip down .

dialogue type : qy^rt^t3
B :  Can I see that ?

dialogue type : s^t3
B :  I yeah , I don't want it on ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I just I just want to , um , say what I think is a problem with this .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  If you are wearing this over your ears and you 've got it all the way out here ,

dialogue type : s
B :  then the balance is gonna want to pull it this way .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  Where as if somebody with a smaller head has it back here ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So this is supposed to be under that little protuberance .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So it 's really supposed to go more like this than like this .

dialogue type : qy.%-
B : 

dialogue type : sj
B :  Well , I guess you can control that .

dialogue type : s
B :  It would be an advantage .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  The other thing that would do it would be to hang a five pound weight off the back .

dialogue type : s^j^r
B :  Hang a five pound weight off the back .

dialogue type : s^2^rt
B :  Counter - balance .

dialogue type : qr
B :  Did did they give a talk on this or was this informal ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  What was the , um the paper by , um , Lori Lamel that you mentioned ?

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  What was their rough what was their conclusion ?

dialogue type : qr
B :  Did they ever try going going the other direction from simpler task to more complicated tasks ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B :  or ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Do you remember who the groups were that we 're doing ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Was were there folks from BBN presenting ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Was SRA one of the groups talking about summarization , no ?

dialogue type : s
B :  This was my concern about the recognizer in Aurora .

dialogue type : s^m.%-
B :  That the differences we 're seeing in the front - end is b

dialogue type : s^aa^m
B :  are irrelevant

dialogue type : s
B :  once you get a real recognizer at the back - end .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  You know ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  But doesn't their conclusion just sort of you could have guessed that before they even started ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because if you assume that these learning things get better and better and better ,

dialogue type : s
B :  then as you approach there 's a point where you can't get any better ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  You get everything right .

dialogue type : s
B :  So they 're all approaching .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  But what I 'm saying is that th they have to , as they all get better , they have to get closer together .

dialogue type : s
B :  But they 're all going the same way ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  So you have to get closer .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  Oh they didn't ?

dialogue type : s^cs:s
B :  Maybe they should have said " focus " or something .
