dialogue type : z
A :  OK . We seem to be recording .

dialogue type : z
A :  So , sorry about not

dialogue type : z
A :  not pre - doing everything .

dialogue type : z
A :  The lunch went a little later than I was expecting ,

dialogue type : z
A :  Chuck .

dialogue type : z
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : z
A :  Pretty much .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  I mean , we don't want anything too practical .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  Well , we have steps forward .

dialogue type : s^t
A :  I have a little bit of IRAM stuff

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  but I 'm not sure if that 's of general interest or not .

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  IRAM .

dialogue type : s
A :  IRAM , bigram ,

dialogue type : s.%
A :  you know .

dialogue type : qw
A :  What 's the interesting stuff ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  And did you hand - label who was loud and who was quiet ,

dialogue type : qrr.%-
A :  or did you just ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s^bu
A :  Right . So this would work well for , uh , pauses and utterance boundaries and things like that .

dialogue type : s
A :  But for overlap I imagine that doesn't work at all ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah . It was IS two .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Well , maybe we should get it

dialogue type : s
A :  and if it 's good enough we 'll arrange Windows machines to be available .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
A :  No , no . Praat isn't Praat 's multi - platform .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
A :  What our decision was is that we 'll go ahead with what we have with a not very fine time scale on the overlaps .

dialogue type : s
A :  And and do what we can later to clean that up if we need to .

dialogue type : qy^rt^tc
A :  And did you , uh , forward Morgan Brian 's thing ?

dialogue type : qy^bh
A :  Oh , you did ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  OK . So you probably did get that .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
A :  Yeah , and Dave Gelbart did volunteer ,

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  to at least modify Transcriber ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  which , if we don't have something else that works , I think that 's a pretty good way of going .

dialogue type : s
A :  And we discussed on some methods to do it .

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
A :  My approach originally ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  it was too slow because I was trying to display all the waveforms .

dialogue type : s
A :  But he pointed out that you don't really have to .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  I think that 's a good point .

dialogue type : s
A :  That if you just display the mix waveform and then have a user interface for editing the different channels , that 's perfectly sufficient .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
A :  No . They can only display one ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but they can listen to different ones .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  But only to listen to ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  not to look at .

dialogue type : s
A :  The waveform you 're looking at doesn't change .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Oh , we should definitely get with them then ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  and

dialogue type : s
A :  agree upon a format .

dialogue type : s
A :  Though I don't remember email on that .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  So was I not in the loop on that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , I think that 's right .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , I think it 's important both for the notation and the machine representation to be the same .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  Cross - correlation .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : sj^ba^bu
A :  using the close - talking I think would be much better .

dialogue type : qy^g
A :  Wouldn't it ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  And I hope that if we do a forced alignment with the close - talking mike , that will be enough to recover at least some of the time the time information of when the overlap occurred .

dialogue type : s^bk|qr
A :  Yeah . Who knows ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , u uh , IBM was going to .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  and I imagine they still plan to

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but but , you know , I haven't spoken with them about that recently .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cc
A :  OK . I 'll do that .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is he on the mailing list ?

dialogue type : qy^d^e^g^rt.%--
A :  The Meeting Recorder mailing li ?

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  We should add him .

dialogue type : s^co^r
A :  Add him .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so one thing is that I did look on Sony 's for a replacement for the mikes for the head m head - worn ones

dialogue type : s^df
A :  cuz they 're so uncomfortable .

dialogue type : s
A :  But I think I need someone who knows more about mikes than I do ,

dialogue type : s
A :  because I couldn't find a single other model that seemed like it would fit the connector ,

dialogue type : s
A :  which seems really unlikely to me .

dialogue type : qy
A :  Does anyone , like , know stores

dialogue type : qrr
A :  or know about mikes who who would know the right questions to ask ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  When I looked , i they listed one microphone and that 's it

dialogue type : s^e
A :  as having that type of connector .

dialogue type : s
A :  But my guess is that Sony maybe uses a different number for their connector than everyone else does .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  it seems it seems really unlikely to me that there 's only one .

dialogue type : s:qh^rt
A :  As I said , who knows ?

dialogue type : h
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I have it downstairs .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't remember off the top of my head .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , I had thought about this before .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , when when when you use a product like DragonDictate , they have a very extensive description about how to wear the microphone and so on .

dialogue type : s
A :  But I felt that in a real situation we were very seldom gonna get people to really do it

dialogue type : s^df
A :  and maybe it wasn't worth concentrating on .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Oh . That 's true .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  Well , I 'll dig through the documentation to DragonDictate and ste s see if they still have the little form .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  It seemed to me when I was using Dragon that it was really microphone placement helped an in , uh an enormous amount .

dialogue type : s
A :  So you want it enough to the side so that when you exhale through your nose , it doesn't the wind doesn't hit the mike .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^j
A :  Everyone 's adjusting their microphones , of course .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then just close enough so that you get good volume .

dialogue type : s
A :  So you know , wearing it right about here seems to be about the right way to do it .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , when when it 's on , you can see it .

dialogue type : s^r
A :  You can definitely see it .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
A :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so , you know , I 've I 've sat here and watched sometimes the breathing ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and the bar going up and down ,

dialogue type : s:s
A :  and I 'm thinking , I could say something ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  but

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I don't want to make people self - conscious .

dialogue type : s^co^j
A :  Stop breathing !

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then also the position of the mike also .

dialogue type : s
A :  If it 's more directly , you 'll get better volume .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  So so , like , yours is pretty far down below your mouth . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j^no
A :  I don't know why that is .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  I 've been eating a lot .

dialogue type : fg
A :  So ,

dialogue type : s^2^rt
A :  mark them ?

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Oh , great .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Against they could do forced alignment .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  Oh , I didn't know that .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  That would be a really interesting prosodic feature ,

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : qo
A :  So are do you treat breath and laughter as phonetically , or as word models , or what ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Mouth stuff ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  How would we do that with the hybrid system ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  So train a phone in the neural net ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  Oh , it does ?

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
A :  Right . So in the hybrid system we could train the net with a laughter phone and a breath sound phone .

dialogue type : s
A :  Do whatever you want .

dialogue type : qy^2^bu^d^rt
A :  To go on forever ?

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  And how do you handle it in the language model ?

dialogue type : s^m
A :  It 's just a word in the language model .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Cool .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^co^rt
A :  Can you hand me your digit form ?

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I just wanna mark that you did not read digits .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  I was noticing that with Dan in the one that we , uh we hand tran hand - segmented ,

dialogue type : s
A :  that th he has these little chuckles as he talks .

dialogue type : qy^2^d^rt
A :  Speech researchers ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Cuz they 're gonna be transcribing it in a few days .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  That 's a good idea .

dialogue type : b
A :  Good .

dialogue type : s^fe
A :  Oh , no .

dialogue type : qy
A :  Is that good or bad ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  You 'll self - repair .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.x
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qw^j
A :  Where were they when we needed them ?

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , this was something that we were talking about .

dialogue type : s
A :  We could get a very detailed overlap if they were willing to transcribe each meeting four or five times .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
A :  One for each participant .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  Is you mean two thousand one ?

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  Calendar year

dialogue type : qrr.%--
A :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Full - time .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba^fe
A :  Wow .

dialogue type : s
A :  I don't see how someone could do forty hours a week on transcription .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  We 'd have to mark them .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
A :  I think it would also be interesting to have , uh , a couple of the meetings have more than one transcriber do ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  cuz I 'm curious about inter - annotator agreement .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Wrong .

dialogue type : s
A :  I think it just whoever is interested can do that .

dialogue type : s^cs^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  We could skip the digits .

dialogue type : s^cs^df
A :  We don't have to read digits each time .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  With what ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
A :  Scale .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : fg|s^arp.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^am
A :  I think Javier 's might be able to .

dialogue type : s
A :  It doesn't have the same Gaus - uh , H M M modeling ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  which is I think a drawback .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
A :  Does it ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then he ch you choose optimal splitting .

dialogue type : s^nd
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Yeah , I didn't think so .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so I I think it would work fine for detecting overlap .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bs
A :  What he does is , as a first pass he he p he does , um , a guess at where the divisions might be and he overestimates .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  And that 's just a data reduction step ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so that you 're not trying at every time interval .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so those are the putative places where he tries .

dialogue type : s
A :  And right now he 's doing that with silence

dialogue type : s
A :  and that doesn't work

dialogue type : s^e
A :  with the Meeting Recorder .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  So if we used another method to get the first pass , I think it would probably work .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  It 's a good method .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  As long as the len as long the segments are long enough .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's the other problem .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  You mean Javier 's ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  What do you mean ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Yeah . I had tried doing it by hand at one point with a very short sample ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and it worked pretty well ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  but I haven't worked with it a lot .

dialogue type : s
A :  So what I d I d I took a hand - segmented sample

dialogue type : s
A :  and I added ten times the amount of numbers at random ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and it did pick out pretty good boundaries .

dialogue type : s
A :  But this was just very anecdotal sort of thing .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
A :  Right . So if we if we fed the hand - segmentation to Javier 's and it doesn't work , then we know something 's wrong .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Yeah . I think that 's probably worthwhile doing .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Whether it 'll work or not .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Y do you know where his software is ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Have you used it at all ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  I I have as well ,

dialogue type : s^co
A :  so if you need need help let me know .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  uuh
