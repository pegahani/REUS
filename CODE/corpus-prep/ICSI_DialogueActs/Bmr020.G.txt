dialogue type : z
G :  I 'm doing some

dialogue type : z
G :  square brackets ,

dialogue type : z
G :  coffee sipping ,

dialogue type : z
G :  square brackets .

dialogue type : z
G :  Mmm ! Gar - darn !

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s
G :  I hope they accept it .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  I mean , I

dialogue type : s^e
G :  both actu as as a submission and you know , as a paper .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^na
G :  We actually exceeded the delayed deadline by o another day ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  so .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Well yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Liz had sent them a note saying " could we please have another " I don't know , " three days " or something ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  and they said yes .

dialogue type : fh
G :  But u

dialogue type : s^t3
G :  I think several people sent this ,

dialogue type : s^bk^t3
G :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  there there were some interesting results in this paper , though .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  For instance that Morgan uh , accounted for fifty - six percent of the Robustness meetings in terms of number of words .

dialogue type : s^r
G :  Number of words .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
G :  No . Well , according to the transcripts .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , we didn't mention Morgan by name

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^ar
G :  No ,

dialogue type : s^nd
G :  we as identify him as the person dominating the conversation .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right

dialogue type : b
G :  Hmm .

dialogue type : h
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
G :  well it was about it had three sections

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  three kinds of uh results , if you will .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
G :  Uh , the one was that the just the the amount of overlap

dialogue type : fh
G :  um ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  s in terms of in terms of number of words

dialogue type : s
G :  and also we computed something called a " spurt " ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which is essentially a stretch of speech with uh , no pauses exceeding five hundred milliseconds .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  Um , and we computed how many overlapped i uh spurts there were and how many overlapped words there were . Um , for four different corpora ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  the Meeting Recorder meetings ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  the Robustness meetings

dialogue type : s^e
G :  Switchboard

dialogue type : s^e
G :  and CallHome ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and , found and sort of compared the numbers .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  and found that the ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
G :  you know , as you might expect the Meeting Recorder meetings had the most overlap

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  uh , but next were Switchboard and CallHome ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which both had roughly the same ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  almost identical in fact ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  and the Robustness meetings were had the least ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  One sort of unexpected result there is that uh two - party telephone conversations have about the same amount of overlap ,

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  Also , I in the Levinson , the pragmatics book , in you know , uh , textbook , there 's I found this great quote where he says you know you know , how people it talks about how uh how how people are so good at turn taking ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and so they 're so good that generally , u the overlapped speech does not is less than five percent .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So ,

dialogue type : s
G :  this is way more than five percent .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , in real conversations ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  everyday conversations .

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's s what these conversation analysts have been studying for years and years there .

dialogue type : s^ng
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  Well it 's time .

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  So but still but still u

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  There are differences in how you measure it ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but still it 's You know , the difference between um between that number and what we have in meetings ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which is more like , you know , close to in meetings like these , uh you know , close to twenty percent .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^m^rt
G :  Robustness meeting ?

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  It was about half of the r

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  So , in terms of number of words , it 's like seventeen or eigh eighteen percent for the Meeting Recorder meetings and about half that for , uh , the Robustness .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , we didn't get to look at that ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but this obvious thing to see if if there 's a dependence on the number of uh participants .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s
G :  And and and then and we also d computed this both with and without backchannels ,

dialogue type : s^df.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  R right .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  so basically you treat backchannels l as nonspeech , as pauses ,

dialogue type : s
G :  you still have significant overlap .

dialogue type : s^e
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  it 's it 's not a dramatic change ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : fg
G :  Anyway ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  That was that was one set of results ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and then the second one was just basically the the stuff we had in the in the HLT paper on how overlaps effect the recognition performance .

dialogue type : s
G :  And we rescored things um , a little bit more carefully .

dialogue type : s
G :  We also fixed the transcripts in in numerous ways .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
G :  Uh , but mostly we added one one number , which was

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So so the the conjecture from the HLT results was that most of the added recognition error is from insertions due to background speech .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  So , we scored all the recognition results , uh , in such a way that the

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  uh , well Don 's been working hard .

dialogue type : fg
G :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
G :  so so if you have the foreground speaker speaking here , and then there 's some background speech , may be overlapping it somehow ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  um , and this is the time bin that we used ,

dialogue type : s
G :  then of course you 're gonna get insertion errors here and here .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
G :  So we scored everything ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and I must say the NIST scoring tools are pretty nice for this ,

dialogue type : s
G :  where you just basically ignore everything outside of the , uh , region that was deemed to be foreground speech .

dialogue type : s
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  That 's somewhat that 's somewhat subject to error ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but still we we Uh , Don did some ha hand - checking

dialogue type : s
G :  and and we think that based on that , we think that the results are you know , valid ,

dialogue type : s
G :  although of course , some error is gonna be in there .

dialogue type : s
G :  But basically what we found is after we take out these regions so we only score the regions that were certified as foreground speech , the recognition error went down to almost uh , the level of the non - overlapped speech .

dialogue type : s
G :  So that means that even if you do have background speech , if you can somehow separate out or find where it is , uh , the recognizer does a good job ,

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  even though there is this back

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : h|s.%-
G :  Uh , well , we just @ @ we do u you know , vit

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , we do uh , VTL vocal tract length normalization ,

dialogue type : s
G :  w and we uh you know , we we uh , make all the features have zero mean and unit variance .

dialogue type : s^ng
G :  Over over the entire c over the entire channel .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G :  but you know .

dialogue type : s
G :  Um , now we didn't re - align the recognizer for this .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So this is actually a sub - optimal way of doing it ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
G :  right ?

dialogue type : s
G :  So we took the old recognition output

dialogue type : s
G :  and we just scored it differently .

dialogue type : s^e.%-
G :  So the recognizer didn't have the benefit of knowing where the foreground speech a start

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yes .

dialogue type : h|s^aa
G :  Um , it Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap
G :  It u not per I mean , not completely ,

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  but yes ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  dramatically .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  So we have to

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  Well I should bring the should bring the table with results .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Maybe we can look at it Monday .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yes .

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  u s Right .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  so that was number that was the second set of uh , the second section .

dialogue type : s
G :  And then , the third thing was , we looked at , uh , what we call " interrupts " ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  although that 's that may be a misnomer ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  Uh , so we we used the punctuation from the original transcripts

dialogue type : s
G :  and we inferred the beginnings and ends of sentences .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
G :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^ar
G :  No ,

dialogue type : s^e^nd
G :  we only used , you know , uh periods , uh , question marks and exclamation .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  And we know that there 's th that 's not a very g

dialogue type : s^df
G :  I mean , we miss a lot of them ,

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  but but it 's f i i

dialogue type : s^nd
G :  No commas .

dialogue type : s^ar
G :  No .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  And then we looked at locations where ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  uh ,

dialogue type : qw
G :  if you have overlapping speech and someone else starts a sentence , you know , where do these where do other people start their turns not turns really , but you know , sentences ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So we only looked at cases where there was a foreground speaker

dialogue type : s
G :  and then at the to at the so the the foreground speaker started into their sentence and then someone else started later .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
G :  OK ?

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : qw^br^d^rt
G :  Sorry ?

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  Uh , so that such that there was overlap between the two sentences .

dialogue type : s
G :  So , the the question was how can we what can we say about the places where the second or or actually , several second speakers , um start their " interrupts " , as we call them .

dialogue type : %-
G :  w

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  And we looked at this in terms of

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  So so we had we had

dialogue type : fh
G :  um u

dialogue type : s
G :  to for for the purposes of this analysis , we tagged the word sequences , and and we time - aligned them .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and we considered it interrupt if it occurred in the middle of a word ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  we basically you know , considered that to be a interrupt as if it were at at the beginning of the word .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  So that , if any part of the word was overlapped , it was considered an interrupted word .

dialogue type : s
G :  And then we looked at the the locatio the , um , you know , the features that the tags

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because we had tagged these word strings , um , that that occurred right before these these uh , interrupt locations .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  And the tags we looked at are the spurt tag ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^fa
G :  Sorry .

dialogue type : s^bsc
G :  End of spurt .

dialogue type : s
G :  So whether there was a pause essentially here ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because spurts are a defined as being you know , five hundred milliseconds or longer pauses ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and then we had things like discourse markers ,

dialogue type : s
G :  uh , backchannels ,

dialogue type : s
G :  uh , disfluencies .

dialogue type : fh
G :  um ,

dialogue type : s
G : 

dialogue type : s^e
G :  So disfluen the D 's are for , um , the interruption points of a disfluency ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  so , where you hesitate , or where you start the repair there .

dialogue type : fh|qw^t1
G :  Uh , what else do we had .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  Uh , repeated you know , repeated words is another of that kind of disfluencies and so forth .

dialogue type : s
G : 

dialogue type : s^e
G :  uh so , the end of a filled pause

dialogue type : s^e
G :  and the end of a discourse marker .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean we didn't really hand - tag all of these things .

dialogue type : s
G :  We just looked at the distribution of words ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and so every " so yeah " , and " OK " , uh , and " uh - huh " were were the were deemed to be backchannels

dialogue type : s
G :  and " wow " and " so " and uh " right " , uh were um Not " right " . " Right " is a backchannel .

dialogue type : s
G :  But so , we sort of just based on the lexical um , identity of the words , we we tagged them as one of these things .

dialogue type : s
G :  And of course the d the interruption points we got from the original transcripts .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  and then we looked at the disti

dialogue type : s
G :  so we looked at the distribution of these different kinds of tags , overall

dialogue type : s
G :  uh , and and and particularly at the interruption points .

dialogue type : s
G :  And uh , we found that there is a marked difference

dialogue type : fh
G :  so

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  so at the end after a discourse marker or after backchannel or after filled pause , you 're much more likely to be interrupted than before .

dialogue type : fh
G :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
G :  And also of course after spurt ends ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which means basically in p inside pauses .

dialogue type : s^e.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So we have this little histogram which shows these distributions

dialogue type : fh
G :  and , um ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  you know , it 's it 's it 's not No big surprises ,

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  Well we 're ne

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ng
G :  There 's no statement about cause and effect .

dialogue type : s
G :  This is just a statistical correlation ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
G :  Anyway . So ,

dialogue type : s
G :  uh , and that was basically it .

dialogue type : s
G :  And and we so we wrote this

dialogue type : s
G :  and then , we found we were at six pages ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and then we started cutting furiously

dialogue type : s
G :  and threw out half of the material again ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and uh played with the LaTeX stuff

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G :  uh ,

dialogue type : %-
G :  and until it fi

dialogue type : s^ar
G :  No , no .

dialogue type : s^ng
G :  W well , d you couldn't really make everything smaller

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  you know the the gap between the two columns is like ten millimeters ,

dialogue type : s
G :  so I d shrunk it to eight millimeters

dialogue type : s
G :  and that helped some . And stuff like that .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s^nd
G :  y We didn't talk about , uh , prosodic , uh , properties at all ,

dialogue type : s
G :  although that 's I I take it that 's something that uh Don will will look at

dialogue type : s^e
G :  now that we have the data and we have the alignment ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  so .

dialogue type : s
G :  This is purely based on you know the words

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Anyway , so .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  There 's actually uh there 's this a former student of here from Berkeley ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  Nigel Nigel Ward .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Do you know him ?

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  he he lives in Japan now ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and he did this backchanneling , automatic backchanneling system .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So , exactly what you describe ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but for Japanese .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  And it 's apparently for Japa - in Japanese it 's really important that you backchannel .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  It 's really impolite if you don't ,

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : fg
G :  Anyway .

dialogue type : s
G :  So the paper 's on - line

dialogue type : %--
G :  and

dialogue type : s
G :  y I I think I uh I CC ' ed a message to Meeting Recorder with the URL

dialogue type : s
G :  so you can get it .

dialogue type : s
G :  Um , uh one more thing .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  So I I 'm actually about to send Brian Kingbury an email saying where he can find the the s the m the material he wanted for the s for the speech recognition experiment ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  but I haven't sent it out yet

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because actually my desktop locked up ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  like I can't type anything .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Uh

dialogue type : s^cc.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I made a directory .

dialogue type : s^e.%--
G :  I called it

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : x
G : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
G :  He does ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  he prefe he said he would prefer FTP

dialogue type : s
G :  and also , um , the other person that wants it There is one person at SRI who wants to look at the um , you know , the uh the data we have so far ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  and so I figured that FTP is the best approach .

dialogue type : s
G :  So what I did is I um @ @ I made a n new directory

dialogue type : s^e
G :  after Chuck said that would c that was gonna be a good thing .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
G :  Uh , so it 's " FTP pub

dialogue type : s^m^na
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s
G : 

dialogue type : qw^t1
G :  What is it again ?

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
G :  The same the same as the mailing list ,

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  Um actually Oh and this directory , is not readable .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  It 's only uh , accessible .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  So , in other words , to access anything under there , you have to be told what the name is .

dialogue type : s
G :  So that 's sort of a g quick and dirty way of doing access control .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  uh , and the directory for this I call it I " ASR zero point one "

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because it 's sort of meant for recognition .

dialogue type : s
G :  And then then in there I have a file that lists all the other files ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  so that someone can get that file and then know the file names and therefore download them .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  Dash .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Anyway .

dialogue type : s
G :  So all I all I was gonna do there was stick the the transcripts after we the way that we munged them for scoring ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because that 's what he cares about ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G :  um ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and also and then the the waveforms that Don segmented .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , just basically tar them all up f I mean w for each meeting I tar them all into one tar file and G - zip them and stick them there .

dialogue type : fh
G :  And so .

dialogue type : s^bk.%
G :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw^d
G :  March O - one .

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
G :  Oh !

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
G :  Oh she wanted that also ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but they don't have a recognizer even .

dialogue type : fg
G :  But yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s^co
G :  Well , make ano make another directory .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  You don't n m

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
G :  They are ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
G :  OK , because in one directory there 's two versions .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  so but for the other meetings it 's the downsampled version that you have .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s
G :  Oh that 's th important to know ,

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK

dialogue type : fh
G :  so

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  we should probably uh give them the non - downsampled versions .

dialogue type : fg
G :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s^cc.%--
G :  Alright , then I 'll hold off on that and I 'll wait for you

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G :  gen

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s
G :  Yeah , definitely they should have the full bandwidth version ,

dialogue type : fh.%
G :  yeah . OK .

dialogue type : fg|s^df
G :  Well , it takes it takes up less disk space , for one thing .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s
G :  Yeah , it was a small difference

dialogue type : fh
G :  but yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
G :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  good .

dialogue type : s^ba.%--

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh !

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right ,

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean w I mean what I would I was interested in is having a se having time marks for the beginnings and ends of speech

dialogue type : s^e
G :  by each speaker .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Uh , because we could use that to fine tune our alignment process

dialogue type : s^e
G :  to make it more accurate .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
G :  it I don't care that you know , there 's actually abutting segments that we have to join together .

dialogue type : s
G :  That 's fine .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  But what we do care about is that the beginnings and ends um are actually close to the speech inside of that

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK ,

dialogue type : qw
G :  so what is the sort of how tight are they ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : fg
G :  No , no !

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  I don

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  I it 's f

dialogue type : s^na
G :  That 's fine

dialogue type : s^df.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^na^r
G :  th that 's perfectly fine .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  In fact it 's good .

dialogue type : s^df^na
G :  You always want to have a little bit of pause or nonspeech around the speech , say for recognition purposes .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but just just u w you know get an id I just wanted to have an idea of the of how much extra you allowed

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G :  so that I can interpret the numbers if I compared that with a forced alignment segmentation .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  But are we talking about , I don't know , a tenth of a second ?

dialogue type : %--
G :  a ?

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
G :  You know ?

dialogue type : qw^bu
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Well , yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  That 's fine .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well we chose um , you know , half a second

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because if if you go much larger , you have a y you know , your your statement about how much overlap there is becomes less , um , precise ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because you include more of actual pause time into what you consider overlap speech .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  so ,

dialogue type : s
G :  it 's sort of a compromise ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^e
G :  I mean Liz suggested that value based on the distribution of pause times that you see in Switchboard and and other corpora .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  I see .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
G :  So so at some point we will try to fine - tune our forced alignment

dialogue type : s^am^e
G :  maybe using those as references

dialogue type : s
G :  because you know , what you would do is you would play with different parameters .

dialogue type : s
G :  And to get an object You need an objective measure of how closely you can align the models to the actual speech .

dialogue type : s
G :  And that 's where your your data would be very important to have .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s
G :  OK , and I 'm leaving .

dialogue type : fh
G :
