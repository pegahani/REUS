dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : qw
C :  what are we talking about today ?

dialogue type : h
C :  Uh

dialogue type : h
C : 

dialogue type : h
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  oh ,

dialogue type : s^fa
C :  I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : s
C :  I know now I know what you 're talking about .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
C :  No , nobody 's told me anything .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  No , that would have been a good thing to find out before this meeting ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  that 's .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  No , I have no I have no idea .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so

dialogue type : s^co
C :  I mean , let 's let 's assume for right now that we 're just kind of plugging on ahead ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because even if they tell us that , uh , the rules are different , uh , we 're still interested in doing what we 're doing .

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  So what are you doing ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  So when you say " we " , is that something Sunil is doing

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  or is that ?

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  Who is doing that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  You you had a discussion with Sunil about this though ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^cs^ng
C :  Yeah , you should talk with him .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  No , I mean , because the the the the whole problem that happened before was coordination ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s^co
C :  So so you need to discuss with him what we 're doing ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  uh , cuz they could be doing the same thing and or something .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk^r
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^co
C :  We just we just have to be in contact more .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I think that the the fact that we we did that with had that thing with the latencies was indicative of the fact that there wasn't enough communication .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So that would be , uh , a reduction of a hundred and thirty - six milliseconds ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qw
C :  What was the total we ended up with through the whole system ?

dialogue type : qy^d.%--
C :  So that would be within ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  Eighty - five .

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
C :  Hmm !

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  That 's a little bit of a problem .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^ng.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
C :  Just just barely in there .

dialogue type : s
C :  Two - fifty ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  unless they changed the rules .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Which there is there 's some discussion of .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : h|s
C :  Uh , well the people who had very low latency want it to be low uh , very very very narrow , uh , latency bound .

dialogue type : s
C :  And the people who have longer latency don't .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : s
C :  Unfortunately we 're the main ones with long latency ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  but

dialogue type : fh
C :  But , uh ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s
C :  they were more or less trading computation for performance

dialogue type : s
C :  and we were , uh , trading latency for performance .

dialogue type : s
C :  And they were dealing with noise explicitly and we weren't ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and so I think of it as complementary ,

dialogue type : s^e.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Complementary .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  so , uh , everything that we did in in a way it was it was just adamantly insisting on going in with a brain damaged system ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which is something actually , we 've done a lot over the last thirteen years .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , which is we say , well this is the way we should do it .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then we do it .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then someone else does something that 's straight forward .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , w th w this was a test that largely had additive noise

dialogue type : s
C :  and we did we adde did absolutely nothing explicitly to handle ad additive noise .

dialogue type : s
C :  We just , uh , you know , trained up systems to be more discriminant .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And , uh , we did this , uh , RASTA - like filtering

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which was done in the log domain

dialogue type : s
C :  and was tending to handle convolutional noise .

dialogue type : s
C :  We did we actually did nothing about additive noise .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  the , uh , spectral sub subtraction schemes a couple places did seem to seem to do a nice job .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And so ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  we 're talking about putting putting some of that in while still keeping some of our stuff .

dialogue type : s
C :  I think you should be able to end up with a system that 's better than both

dialogue type : s
C :  but clearly the way that we 're operating for this other stuff does involved some latency to to get rid of most of that latency .

dialogue type : s
C :  To get down to forty or fifty milliseconds we 'd have to throw out most of what we 're doing .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And and , uh , I don't think there 's any good reason for it in the application actually .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , you 're you 're you 're speaking to a recognizer on a remote server

dialogue type : s
C :  and , uh , having a a a quarter second for some processing to clean it up . It doesn't seem like it 's that big a deal .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  These aren't large vocabulary things

dialogue type : s^df
C :  so the decoder shouldn't take a really long time , and .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  No .

dialogue type : qw
C :  What what does wa was your experience when you were doing this stuff with , uh , the the the surgical , uh , uh , microscopes and so forth .

dialogue type : fh|qw
C :  Um , how long was it from when somebody , uh , finished an utterance to when , uh , something started happening ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  and that 's when you 'd start doing things .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  Of course that didn't take too long at that point .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  so you you so you had a

dialogue type : s^bu^r
C :  so you had a a quarter second delay before , uh , plus some little processing time ,

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  and then the the microscope would start moving or something .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  And there 's physical inertia there ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so you would think as long as it 's under half a second or something .

dialogue type : s^bd
C :  Uh , I 'm not an expert on that

dialogue type : fh
C :  but .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , basically if you yeah , if you said , uh , um , " what 's the , uh , uh what 's the shortest route to the opera ? "

dialogue type : s
C :  and it took half a second to get back to you ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  I mean , it would be f

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , it might even be too abrupt .

dialogue type : s
C :  You might have to put in a s a s a delay .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Well , anyway ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  we could cut we know what else , we could cut down on the neural net time

dialogue type : s^cs^e
C :  by by , uh , playing around a little bit ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
C :  going more into the past ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
C :  or something like that .

dialogue type : s
C :  We t we talked about that .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^e
C :  well , there 's the neural net and there 's also this , uh , uh , multi - frame , uh , uh , KLT .

dialogue type : s^aap
C :  They weren't looking ahead much .

dialogue type : s^aap^df
C :  They p they looked ahead a little bit .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  I mean , you could do this with a recurrent net .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
C :  But you also could just , um ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I mean , we haven't experimented with this

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  but I imagine you could , um , uh , predict a , uh um , a label , uh , from more in the past than in than than in the future .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , we 've d we 've done some stuff with that before .

dialogue type : s
C :  I think it it works OK .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but we 've but we played a little bit with with asymmetric , guys .

dialogue type : s
C :  You can do it .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , that 's what that 's what you 're busy with ,

dialogue type : s
C :  s messing around with this ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And , uh ,

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
C :  K KLT .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  So at least just to understand maybe what the difference was between how much you were getting from just putting the frames together and how much you 're getting from the discriminative ,

dialogue type : s
C :  what the nonlinearity does for you or doesn't do for you .

dialogue type : s
C :  Just to understand it a little better I guess .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  Yeah , well , that 's what I meant , is to see whether whether it having the neural net really buys you anything .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , I mean , it doe did look like it buys you something over just the KLT .

dialogue type : s
C :  But maybe it 's just the discrimination

dialogue type : s
C :  and and maybe yeah , maybe the nonlinear discrimination isn't necessary .

dialogue type : s
C :  Could be .

dialogue type : s
C :  Good good to know .

dialogue type : s
C :  But the other part you were saying was the spectral subtraction ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qw
C :  At what stage do you do that ?

dialogue type : qy.%--
C :  Do you you 're doing that ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  um ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^co.%-
C :  so just do that on the mel f

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  uh , one thing that would be no good to find out about from this conference call is that what they were talking about , what they 're proposing doing , was having a third party , um , run a good VAD , and and determine boundaries .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then given those boundaries , then have everybody do the recognition .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  The reason for that was that , um , uh if some one p one group put in the VAD and another didn't ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  uh , or one had a better VAD than the other

dialogue type : s
C :  since that they 're not viewing that as being part of the the task ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and that any any manufacturer would put a bunch of effort into having some s kind of good speech - silence detection .

dialogue type : s
C :  It still wouldn't be perfect

dialogue type : fh
C :  but I mean ,

dialogue type : s
C :  e the argument was " let 's not have that be part of this test . "

dialogue type : s^e
C :  " Let 's let 's separate that out . "

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And so ,

dialogue type : s
C :  uh , I guess they argued about that yesterday

dialogue type : %--
C :  and ,

dialogue type : s^fa
C :  yeah , I 'm sorry ,

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't don't know the answer

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  but we should find out .

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm sure we 'll find out soon

dialogue type : s^e
C :  what they , uh what they decided .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , so there 's the question of the VAD

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
C :  but otherwise it 's it 's on the the , uh the mel fil filter bank , uh , energies I guess ?

dialogue type : qy.%--
C :  You do doing the ?

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  And you 're you 're subtracting in the in the in the I guess it 's power power domain ,

dialogue type : fh|s^bu
C :  uh , or or magnitude domain .

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
C :  Probably power domain , right ?

dialogue type : %
C :  why

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b
C :  yep .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  I mean , if you look at the theory , it 's it should be in the power domain

dialogue type : s
C :  but but , uh , I 've seen implementations where people do it in the magnitude domain

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I have asked people why

dialogue type : s
C :  and they shrug their shoulders and say , " oh , it works . "

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean people who do this a lot I guess have developed little tricks of the trade .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  you don't just subtract the the estimate of the noise spectrum .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Or or less ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , that 's I mean , that 's what differs from different different tasks and different s uh , spectral subtraction methods .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  I mean , if if you have , uh , fair assurance that , uh , the noise is is quite stationary , then the smartest thing to do is use as much data as possible to estimate the noise ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  get a much better estimate , and subtract it off .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  But if it 's varying at all , which is gonna be the case for almost any real situation , you have to do it on - line , uh , with some forgetting factor or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , there 's a lot of different ways of computing the noise spectrum .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^df
C :  actually , he 's he wasn't the only one I guess ,

dialogue type : s
C :  was to , uh , take some period of of of speech and in each band , uh , develop a histogram .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , to get a decent histogram of these energies takes at least a few seconds really .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , uh I mean you can do it with a smaller amount

dialogue type : s^e
C :  but it 's pretty rough .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And , um , in fact I think the NIST standard method of determining signal - to - noise ratio is based on this .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No , no ,

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  it 's based on this kind of method ,

dialogue type : s^e^nd
C :  this histogram method .

dialogue type : s
C :  So you have a histogram .

dialogue type : s
C :  Now , if you have signal and you have noise , you basically have these two bumps in the histogram ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which you could approximate as two Gaussians .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  So you have a mixture of two Gaussians .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  And you can use EM to figure out what it is . You know .

dialogue type : s
C :  So so basically now you have this mixture of two Gaussians ,

dialogue type : s
C :  you you n know what they are ,

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s^fa
C :  I mean , sorry ,

dialogue type : s^bsc
C :  you estimate what they are ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  and , uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so this gives you what the signal is and what the noise e energy is in that band in the spectrum .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then you look over the whole thing

dialogue type : s
C :  and now you have a noise spectrum .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  So , uh , Hans - Guenter Hirsch and others have used that kind of method .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  And the other thing to do is which is sort of more trivial and obvious is to , uh , uh , determine through magical means that that , uh , there 's no speech in some period ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  and then see what the spectrum is .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  but ,

dialogue type : s
C :  you know , it 's that that that 's tricky to do .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  It has mistakes .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Uh , and if you 've got enough time , uh , this other method appears to be somewhat more reliable .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Uh , a variant on that for just determining signal - to - noise ratio is to just , uh you can do a w a uh an iterative thing , EM - like thing , to determine means only .

dialogue type : s
C :  I guess it is EM still ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  but just just determine the means only .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Don't worry about the variances .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  And then you just use those mean values as being the the , uh uh signal - to - noise ratio in that band .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  Not necessarily .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Cuz if you don't look into the future ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
C :  esti some guess

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's an interesting question .

dialogue type : s
C :  I wonder how they did do it ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Well , yeah ,

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  but what does what what what does Alcatel do ?

dialogue type : qw^d^e
C :  And and France Telecom .

dialogue type : s^2
C :  Pretty stationary .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
C :  Well , the thing , e e e e

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  Yeah , y I mean , you 're talking about non - stationary noise

dialogue type : s
C :  but I think that spectral subtraction is rarely is is not gonna work really well for for non - stationary noise ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  you know ?

dialogue type : s^nd.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^nd^r
C :  but that 's hard to do .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  So so I think that that what what is wh what 's more common is that you 're going to be helped with r slowly varying or stationary noise .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  That 's what spectral subtraction will help with , practically speaking .

dialogue type : s
C :  If it varies a lot , to get a If if to get a good estimate you need a few seconds of speech ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  even if it 's centered ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s^df
C :  if you need a few seconds to get a decent estimate but it 's changed a lot in a few seconds , then it , you know , i it 's kind of a problem .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , imagine e five hertz is the middle of the of the speech modulation spectrum ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  So imagine a jack hammer going at five hertz .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , good good luck .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  No , I understand it 's better to do

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  but I just think that that , uh , for real noises wh what what 's most likely to happen is that there 'll be some things that are relatively stationary

dialogue type : s^e
C :  where you can use one or another spectral subtraction thing

dialogue type : s
C :  and other things where it 's not so stationary

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , you can always pick something that that falls between your methods ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^no
C :  but I don't know if , you know , if sinusoidally , uh , modul amplitude modulated noise is is sort of a big problem in in in practice .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Well .

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s^r
C :  You 're saying , cheat .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Oh , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  sure .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right ,

dialogue type : s
C :  the word " stationary " is has a very precise statistical meaning .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , you know , in in signal - processing really what we 're talking about I think is things that change slowly , uh , compared with our our processing techniques .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  So if you 're driving along in a car I I would think that most of the time the nature of the noise is going to change relatively slowly .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  It 's not gonna stay absolute the same .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  If you if you check it out , uh , five minutes later you may be in a different part of the road

dialogue type : s
C :  or whatever .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  But it 's it 's i i i

dialogue type : s
C :  using the local characteristics in time , is probably going to work pretty well .

dialogue type : s
C :  But you could get hurt a lot if you just took some something from the beginning of all the speech , of , you know , an hour of speech

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , so they may be you know , may be overly , uh , complicated for for this test

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  but but , uh ,

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
C :  But what you 're saying , you know , makes sense , though .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , if possible you shouldn't you should you should make it , uh , the center of the center of the window .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  uh , we 're already having problems with these delay , uh delay issues .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  uh , we 'll have to figure ways without it .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  You bet .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I I imagine that 's what they 're doing ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  they 're probably looking in nonspeech sections

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
C : 

dialogue type : qy^r^rt
C :  Does France Telecom do th do the same thing ?

dialogue type : qy^d^e
C :  More or less ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^tc.%--
C :  if we 're we 're done done with that ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^t1
C :  let 's see .

dialogue type : s^co^t^tc
C :  Uh , maybe we can talk about a couple other things briefly ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  just , uh , things that that we 've been chatting about

dialogue type : s^e
C :  but haven't made it into these meetings yet .

dialogue type : s
C :  So you 're coming up with your quals proposal ,

dialogue type : qy^co^rt
C :  and , uh Wanna just give a two three minute summary of what you 're planning on doing ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  So that , by the way , basically is a is one of the units in our in our our neural network .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  So that 's all it is .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  It 's a sig it 's a sigmoid ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  uh , with weighted sum at the input ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which you train by gradient descent .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Well , actually ,

dialogue type : fg
C :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so I was using EM to get the targets .

dialogue type : s
C :  So so you have this this this AND gate what we were calling an AND gate , but it 's a product product rule thing at the output .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^fa
C :  I 'm sorry ,

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
C :  there 's it 's an OR at the output , isn't it ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so that 's the product .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And then ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  then he has each of these AND things .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  um ,

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  so they 're little neural neural units .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  and , um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  they have to have targets .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so the targets come from EM .

dialogue type : s
C :  You know , it has a number of properties that I really liked .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  I mean , one is the going towards , um , using narrow band information for , uh , ph phonetic features of some sort

dialogue type : s^e
C :  rather than just , uh , immediately going for the the typical sound units .

dialogue type : s
C :  Another thing I like about it is that you t this thing is going to be trained explicitly trained for a product of errors rule ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which is what , uh , Allen keeps pointing out that Fletcher observed in the twenties ,

dialogue type : s
C :  uh , for people listening to narrow band stuff . That 's Friday 's talk , by the way .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And then , um ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C :  Uh , the third thing I like about it is ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  uh , and we 've played around with this in a different kind of way a little bit

dialogue type : s^e
C :  but it hasn't been our dominant way of of operating anything ,

dialogue type : s
C :  um , this issue of where the targets come from .

dialogue type : s
C :  So in our case when we 've been training it multi - band things , the way we get the targets for the individual bands is , uh , that we get the phonetic label for the sound there

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  and we say , " OK , we train every "

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  or not ultimate but penultimate goal is getting these these small sound units .

dialogue type : fh
C :  But but , um ,

dialogue type : qw.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  uh , what should we be training these intermediate things for ?

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I mean , because , uh , we don't know uh , that this is a particularly good feature .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  someone in the audience yesterday was asking , " well couldn't you have people go through and mark the individual bands and say where the where it was sonorant or not ? "

dialogue type : s
C :  But , you know , I think having a bunch of people listening to critical band wide , uh , chunks of speech trying to determine whether I think it 'd be impossible .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  It 's all gonna sound like like sine waves to you , more or less .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  Well not

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  I mean , it 's g all g

dialogue type : s
C :  narrow band

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  i I m I think it 's very hard for someone to to a person to make that determination .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , um ,

dialogue type : fh|s^no
C :  um , we don't really know how those should be labeled .

dialogue type : s
C :  It could sh be that you should , um , not be paying that much attention to , uh , certain bands for certain sounds , uh , in order to get the best result .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , um , what we have been doing there , just sort of mixing it all together , is certainly much much cruder than that .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  We trained these things up on the on the , uh the final label .

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  You 've done that .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Did did that help at all ?

dialogue type : s
C :  So so that may or may t it that aspect of what he 's doing may or may not be helpful

dialogue type : s^df.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  But this is this is , uh , I th I think a little more direct .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , he 's look he 's just actually looking at , uh , the confusions between sonorant and non - sonorant .

dialogue type : s
C :  So he hasn't applied it to recognition

dialogue type : s
C :  or if he did he didn't talk about it .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And one of the concerns in the audience , actually , was that that , um , the , uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  uh he he did a comparison to , uh , you know , our old foil ,

dialogue type : s
C :  the the nasty old standard recognizer with mel mel filter bank at the front , and H M Ms , and and so forth .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , um , it didn't do nearly as well ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  especially in in noise .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  one of the good questions in the audience was , well , yeah , but that wasn't trained for that .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , this use of a very smooth , uh , spectral envelope is something that , you know , has evolved as being generally a good thing for speech recognition

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^e
C :  So sonorants and non - sonorants is is is almost like voiced - unvoiced , except I guess that the voiced stops are are also called " obstruents " .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  it 's uh , but with the exception of the stops I guess it 's pretty much the same as voiced - unvoiced ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  if you knew you were doing that ,

dialogue type : s
C :  if you were doing something say for a a , uh a a Vocoder , you wouldn't use the same kind of features .

dialogue type : s
C :  You would use something that was sensitive to the periodicity and and not just the envelope .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , and so in that sense it was an unfair test .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so I think that the questioner was right .

dialogue type : s
C :  It it was in that sense an unfair test .

dialogue type : s
C :  Nonetheless , it was one that was interesting because , uh , this is what we are actually using for speech recognition ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  these smooth envelopes .

dialogue type : s
C :  And this says that perhaps even , you know , trying to use them in the best way that we can , that that that we ordinarily do , with , you know , Gaussian mixtures and H M Ms and so forth , you you don't , uh , actually do that well on determining whether something is sonorant or not .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Which means you 're gonna make errors between similar sounds that are son sonorant or obstruent .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  The - these same people ?

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't remember that .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  you 're right ,

dialogue type : s^na
C :  that 's exactly the question to follow up this discussion , is

dialogue type : s^na
C :  suppose you did that , uh , got that right .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Now this was coming at it from a different angle

dialogue type : s^na
C :  but maybe it 's a good way to start .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , these are things which , uh , John felt that a a , uh a human annotator would be able to reliably mark .

dialogue type : s
C :  So the sort of things he felt would be difficult for a human annotator to reliably mark would be tongue position kinds of things .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  But stress doesn't , uh , fit in this thing of coming up with features that will distinguish words from one another ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s^na
C :  It 's a it 's a good thing to mark

dialogue type : s^df
C :  and will probably help us ultimate with recognition

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Well , yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but i either case you 'd write PERMIT ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  So you 'd get the word right .

dialogue type : h
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  But that 's this afternoon 's meeting .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  We don't understand anything in this meeting .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  that 's , you know , a neat neat thing

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , that 's not an immediate problem , that we don't immediately have a lot of extra transcriber time .

dialogue type : s
C :  But but , uh , in the long term I guess Chuck is gonna continue the dialogue with John

dialogue type : fh
C :  and and , uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and , we 'll we 'll end up doing some I think .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , I think it 's an interesting interesting way to go .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I say it like " said - int " . I think it has a number of good things .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh|qy^co^d^rt^tc
C :  so , uh , y you want to talk maybe a c two or three minutes about what we 've been talking about today and other days ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Avendano .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  There 's also this , uh , um , uh , echo cancellation stuff that we 've sort of been chasing ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so , uh

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  and when we 're saying these digits now we do have a close microphone signal

dialogue type : s
C :  and then there 's the distant microphone signal .

dialogue type : s
C :  And you could as a kind of baseline say , " OK , given that we have both of these , uh , we should be able to do , uh , a cancellation . "

dialogue type : s
C :  So that , uh , um , we we , uh , essentially identify the system in between the linear time invariant system between the microphones and and and and re and invert it ,

dialogue type : s
C :  uh , or or cancel it out to to some some reasonable approximation

dialogue type : s^e
C :  through one method or another .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Uh , that 's not a practical thing ,

dialogue type : s
C :  uh , if you have a distant mike , you don't have a close mike ordinarily ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but we thought that might make also might make a good baseline .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , it still won't be perfect because there 's noise .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  And then there are s uh , there are single microphone methods that I think people have done for , uh for this kind of de - reverberation .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Do y do you know any references to any ?

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Cuz I I w I was w w I I lead him down a a bad path on that .

dialogue type : %--
C :  But .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  The first paper on this is gonna have great references ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I can tell already .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's always good to have references ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  especially when reviewers read it

dialogue type : s^e
C :  or or one of the authors and , feel they 'll " You 're OK ,

dialogue type : s^j
C :  you 've r You cited me . "

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  The oth the other thing , uh , that Dave was talking about earlier was , uh , uh , multiple mike things ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
C :  uh , where they 're all distant .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , um , I mean , there 's there 's all this work on arrays ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but the other thing is , uh , what can we do that 's cleverer that can take some advantage of only two mikes ,

dialogue type : s
C :  uh , particularly if there 's an obstruction between them ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  as we as we have over there .

dialogue type : s
C :  An obstruction between them .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  It creates a shadow

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which is is helpful .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  It 's part of why you have such good directionality with , with two ears

dialogue type : s^e
C :  even though they 're not several feet apart .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  For most for most people 's heads .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  that 's what it 's for .

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  It 's basically ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^df^na
C :  it 's to separate the ears .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  That 's right ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Anyway ,

dialogue type : fh|s^tc
C :  O K . Uh , I think that 's that 's all we have this week .

dialogue type : fh|s^t
C :  And , uh , I think it 's digit time .

dialogue type : qy^bh^d
C :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
C :  Oh !

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
C :  Oh !

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  Well there 's no real reason to write our names on here then ,

dialogue type : qy^g
C :  is there ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Or do did any do we need the names for the other stuff ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : fg
C :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I didn't notice this .

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm sitting here

dialogue type : s
C :  and I was I was about to read them too .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's a , uh , blank sheet of paper .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b
C :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s^cc^j
C :  I 'll do my credit card number later .

dialogue type : fh
C :  OK .
