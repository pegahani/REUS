dialogue type : s
B :  I had the same intuition last last last week .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think it 's to start with it 's s your your idea of simplifying ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  Sorry ,

dialogue type : qw^br
B :  what ?

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Well , you you you don't have to study everybody individually

dialogue type : s^e
B :  but just simple case

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and the one that has the lot of data associated with it .

dialogue type : qrr^e
B :  Or or what if what if the equipment what if the equipment adjusts somehow ,

dialogue type : s
B :  there 's some equalizing in there ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  Saturation .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  I wanted to ask just s something on the end of this top topic .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , when I presented my results about the uh distribution of overlaps and the speakers and the profiles of the speakers , at the bottom of that I did have a proposal ,

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  and you know I said that on my in my summary ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  that you know so it 's like people may have different amounts of being overlapped with or overlapping

dialogue type : s
B :  but that in itself is not informative without knowing what types of overlaps they 're involved in

dialogue type : s
B :  so I was planning to do a taxonomy of types overlaps with reference to that .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , but it you know it 's like it sounds like you also have uh something in that direction .

dialogue type : qy.%-
B : 

dialogue type : sj^ba^t1
B :  Interesting .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
B :  Well maybe we can

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  It seems like we also s with reference to a purpose , too , that we we 'd want to have them coded .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  I can do that .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , I see this as a prototype , to use the only the the already transcribed meeting as just a prototype .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , maybe It may be correlated .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  It is an empirical question , it seems like .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  It 's possible to try it both ways ,

dialogue type : qy^g
B :  isn't it ?

dialogue type : s^t1.%--
B :  in this small

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Great .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep , I agree .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Good .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , it wouldn't be I wasn't planning to label the time marks .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I was thinking that that would come from the engineering side ,

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  There you go .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Good . Good .

dialogue type : b
B :  Great !

dialogue type : b
B :  Good , good .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  It would be very inefficient .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Good . OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Good .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
B :  Yeah . Let 's do that later .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Oh !

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Oh good , OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  How So it 's two pages per person ?

dialogue type : s^bk^fe^rt
B :  Oh !

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  Date and time .

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  Uh why did you switch the order of the Date and Time fields ?

dialogue type : s^bd.%-
B :  This is rather a low - level , but

dialogue type : s
B :  On on the new one , Time comes first and then Date ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  This is this is rather a low level question , but but it used used to be Date came first .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh I see .

dialogue type : qw
B :  Well , how would the How would the user know the time if they didn't know the date ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So the time is supposed to be pretty exact ,

dialogue type : s
B :  because I 've just been taking beginning time time of the meeting .

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
B :  Oh dear .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  We 've been we 've been messing up your forms .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  Oh , well , I was saying if we started the meeting at two thirty ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I 'd put two thirty , and I guess d e everyone was putting two thirty ,

dialogue type : s.%--:s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aap^cs
B :  Ei - either that or maybe you could maybe write down when people start reading digits on that particular session .

dialogue type : s^aa^bd
B :  I know , OK .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  That 's a good point .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Good point good point .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : %-
B :  w

dialogue type : s^rt^t1
B :  Seat and Session .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qw
B :  Well that does raise another question , which is why is the " Professional use only " line not higher ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  Why doesn't it come in at the point of Date and Seat ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Oh . Because we 're filling in other things .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Well , because If y your your professional use ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  you 're gonna already have the date , and the s

dialogue type : s
B :  Well I 'm comparing the new one with the old one .

dialogue type : s
B :  This is the digit form .

dialogue type : s^rt.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  Sorry . Sorry .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  uh OK .

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  Sorry about that .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Alright s but I didn't mean to derail our discussion here ,

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  so you really wanted to start with this other form .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  so th this is So I was looking at the change first .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's like we started with this and now we 've got a new version of it wi with reference to this .

dialogue type : s
B :  So the digit form ,

dialogue type : s
B :  we had one already .

dialogue type : s
B :  Now the f the fields are slightly different .

dialogue type : s
B :  What And there 's an addition of the native language , which is a bit redundant .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  This one has Native Language and this one does too .

dialogue type : s^bk^ft
B :  Oh ! Thank you . Thank you , thank you .

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  There we go .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^fa^t1
B :  I 'll catch up here .

dialogue type : s^bk^t1
B :  OK , I see .

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  That 's the old and that 's the new .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  No , that 's not bad .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  so , roughly .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  So . You could say , you know " ten years on the east coast , five years on the west coast " or something or other .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh . OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I wouldn't know how to characterize mine either .

dialogue type : s
B :  And and so I would think I would say , I 've I 've got a mix of California and Ohio .

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^m
B :  Geek region .

dialogue type : s^cs:qw
B :  I 'm wondering about a question like , " Where are you from mostly ? "

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
B :  I agree . I agree .

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  I agree .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Scandinavian , the Minnesota area 's north .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , @ @ . OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^co^j
B :  Just rule them out .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 'd be pretty simple , yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs:qw
B :  Where are you from mostly ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Well , see , I 'm thinking " Where are you from mostly "

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because , you know , then you have some some kind of subjective amount of time factored into it .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^e
B :  Yeah , or Boston .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , they do .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah I agree I agree . I agree .

dialogue type : s
B :  And they 're proud of it .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  It 's identity thing .

dialogue type : qh
B :  Well , we ca Well , why can't we just say characterize something like char characterize your accent

dialogue type : s:s
B :  and and so I would say , " I don't know " .

dialogue type : s
B :  But someone from Boston with a really strong coloration would know .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  And so would an R - less Maine or something ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Good .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs^ng:qw
B :  Oh . Yeah . I I would say more more sweepingly , " how would you characterize your accent ? "

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Well , I think this discussion has made me think that 's s something to consider .

dialogue type : s^am.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  So . I was suggesting not having the options ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Well , I know .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  That 's true .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah that 's fine .

dialogue type : sj^cs
B :  They might say " Other " for Region because they don't know what category to use

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : sj
B :  because it is easier to have it open ended .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , we thought about it .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  that that there are so many types and varieties of these other languages

dialogue type : s
B :  and we are not going to have that many subjects from these different language groups

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and that it 's a huge waste of of space .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  That 's what I thought .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  I don't think that 's what they mean .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : sj^cs
B :  I mean . I I would think that these categories would be more w would be easier for an an analyst to put in rather than the subject himself .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  I sort of thought they were part of the one of the Midlands .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Fine by me , fine by me .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Be easier on the subjects .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think that 's fine .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : sj^ba^df
B :  I like that . I like that .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , I do .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Sure , yeah !

dialogue type : s
B :  I think that 's fine .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  That 's right .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  And it 's easy on the subjects .

dialogue type : s
B :  Now I have one suggestion on the next section .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  So you have native language ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  you have region ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and then you have time spent in English speaking country .

dialogue type : s^cs:s
B :  Now , I wonder if it might be useful to have another open field saying " which one parenthesis S paren closed parenthesis " .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  It doesn't have to be ex all at all exact , just in the same open field format that you have .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  with a with an S

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  " which one

dialogue type : s
B :  sss , optional S .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , that 's good .

dialogue type : qh^ba
B :  Isn't that wonderful !

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba^fe
B :  Excellent !

dialogue type : s^ft
B :  Thank you !

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So you this is n Dan 's patches , Dan Ellis 's patches .

dialogue type : sj^ba^fe
B :  Fantastic !

dialogue type : b.x
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  That 's a consideration .

dialogue type : s
B :  And this 'll be a hav having the multiwave will be a big help

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz in terms of like disentangling overlaps and things , that 'll be a big help .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
B :  That 's excellent .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  He also has version control which is another nice

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Oh , I thought it was in one of those patches .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Well . Alright .

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  Well , or use the one that crawls .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So . Dan proposed it to the Transcriber central people ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So . And and they responded favorably

dialogue type : s
B :  looks as though it will be incorporated in the future version .

dialogue type : s
B :  They said that the only reason they hadn't had the multi the parallel uh stream one before was simply that they hadn't had time to do it .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And uh so it 's likely that this this may be entered into the ch this central @ @ .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Well that 's that 's that 's true , too .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  This is a a useful thing for us .

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So . This one that we now have does have the status of potentially being incorporated l likely being incorporated into the central code .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : sj
B :  I mean it 's I think it 's a nice feature to have it set that way .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Mm - hmm . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I just like the idea of it being something that 's , you know , tied back into the original , so that other people can benefit from it .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  However . I also understand that you can have widgets that are very useful for their purpose and that you don't need to always go that w route .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
B :  Uh - oh .

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt.%--
B :  Well , should we e should we switch off the g

dialogue type : fh
B :  Ke

dialogue type : z
B :  Turn it off .

dialogue type : z
B : 

dialogue type : z
B :  OK .
