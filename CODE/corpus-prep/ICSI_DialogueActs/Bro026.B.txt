dialogue type : b
B :  OK ,

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  so We we had a meeting with , uh with Hynek , um , in in which , uh , uh , Sunil and Stephane , uh summarized where they were and and , uh , talked about where we were gonna go .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that that happened sort of mid - week .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : qw
B :  What was the update ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
B :  I think it more likely that what it means is that when Sunil is up there he will grab it .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah . They 're working on a different task .

dialogue type : s
B :  But what 'll happen is is he 'll go back up there and , uh , Pratibha will come back from from , uh , the east coast .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And , uh and and I guess actually , uh , after Eurospeech for a little bit , uh , he 'll go up there too .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , actually everybody who 's working on it will be up there for at least a little while .

dialogue type : s
B :  So they 'll remotely access it from there .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Good idea .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Yeah , for this stuff I don't think we 're quite up to that .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I mean , we 're still so much in development .

dialogue type : s
B :  We want to have just the insiders .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , I mean , I think maybe the thing to me might be I me I 'm sure you 've just been working on on , uh , details of that since the meeting ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  That was that was Tuesday .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^co^t
B :  But I guess maybe the thing since you weren't yo you guys weren't at that that meeting , might be just just to , um , sort of recap , uh , the the conclusions of the meeting .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s:qw^t
B :  Since he 's going out of town like now , and I 'm going out town in a couple weeks , uh , and time is marching , sort of , given all the mu many wonderful things we could be working on , what what will we actually focus on ?

dialogue type : fh|s:qw
B :  And , uh and what do we freeze ?

dialogue type : s.%--:qw.%--
B :  And , you know , what do we ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , um .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , this software that these guys created was certainly a a key part .

dialogue type : s
B :  So then there 's something central

dialogue type : s
B :  and there aren't at least a bunch of different versions going off in in ways that differ trivially .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh , um , and , um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and then within that , I guess the idea was to freeze a certain set of options for now , to run it , uh , a particular way , and decide on what things are gonna be experimented with , as opposed to just experimenting with everything .

dialogue type : s
B :  So keep a certain set of things constant .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , um .

dialogue type : fh|s^co^t
B :  Uh , maybe describe roughly what what we are keeping constant for now ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  or ?

dialogue type : qr^bu^d
B :  This this smoothing is done on the estimate , um , of what you 're going to subtract ? Or on the thing that has already had something subtracted ?

dialogue type : s^bu^m
B :  Oh , it 's on the transfer function for the Wiener filter .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Actually , let me int eh , Dave isn't here to talk about it , but let me just interject .

dialogue type : s
B :  This module , in principle , i I mean , you would know whether it 's true in fact , is somewhat independent from the rest of it .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , because you you re - synthesize speech ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , um .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
B : 

dialogue type : h|s^cs^r
B :  Uh , but you could .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  But you have a re - synthesized thing that you that 's an an option here .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah , I gu I guess my point is that , um , i in some of the work he 's doing in reverberation , one of the things that we 're finding is that , uh , it 's it 's for the for an artificial situation , we can just deal with the reverberation and his techniques work really well .

dialogue type : s
B :  But for the real situation uh , problem is , is that you don't just have reverberation , you have reverberation in noise .

dialogue type : s
B :  And if you don't include that in the model , it doesn't work very well .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So in fact it might be a very nice thing to do , to just take the noise removal part of it and put that in front of what he 's looking at . And , uh , generate new files or whatever , and and , uh , uh and then do the reverberation part .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Anyway .

dialogue type : s^ar|%-
B :  No , no . He 's I mean , e

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , prelims , right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , it 's clear that we , uh we are not with the real case that we 're looking at , we can't just look at reverberation in isolation

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because the interaction between that and noise is is considerable .

dialogue type : s
B :  And that 's I mean , in the past we 've looked at , uh , and this is hard enough , the interaction between channel effects and and , uh and additive noise , uh , so convolutional effects and and additive effects .

dialogue type : sj
B :  And that 's hard enough .

dialogue type : sj.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , we 're trying to deal with that .

dialogue type : s
B :  In a sense that 's what we 're trying to deal with in this Aurora task .

dialogue type : s
B :  And we have , uh , the , uh , uh , LDA stuff that in principle is doing something about convolutional effects .

dialogue type : s
B :  And we have the noise suppression that 's doing something about noise .

dialogue type : fh|sj
B :  Uh , even that 's hard enough .

dialogue type : s
B :  And and the on - line normalization as well , in that s category .

dialogue type : s
B :  i i There 's all these interactions between these two and that 's part of why these guys had to work so hard on on juggling everything around .

dialogue type : s
B :  But now when you throw in the reverberation , it 's even worse ,

dialogue type : s
B :  because not only do you have these effects , but you also have some long time effects .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And , um , so Dave has something which , uh , is doing some nice things under some conditions with with long time effects

dialogue type : s
B :  but when it 's when there 's noise there too , it 's it 's it 's pretty hard .

dialogue type : s^co.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Since any almost any real situation is gonna have uh , where you have the microphone distant , is going to have both things ,

dialogue type : s^co
B :  we we actually have to think about both at the same time .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : fh|s^t
B :  um So there 's this noise suppression thing , which is sort of worked out

dialogue type : s^co^t
B :  and then , uh , maybe you should just continue telling what what else is in the the form we have .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that 's again , that that 's the Wiener filtering , followed by , uh uh , that 's done at the FFT level .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  The the the filtering is done in the frequency domain ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^rt.%-
B :  And then the mel and then the log , and then the

dialogue type : s^m
B :  LDA filter .

dialogue type : %-
B :  And then uh

dialogue type : s^m
B :  downsample ,

dialogue type : s^m
B :  DCT ,

dialogue type : s^m
B :  on - line norm ,

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
B :  Right , and then in parallel with an a neural net . And then following neural net , some probably some orthogonalization .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that 's sort of most of this stuff is yeah , is operating parallel with this other stuff .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So the things that we , um , uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I guess we sort of uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's there 's some , uh , neat ideas for V A

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I think there 's sort of like There 's a bunch of tuning things to improve stuff .

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's questions about various places where there 's an exponent , if it 's the right exponent , or ways that we 're estimating noise , that we can improve estimating noise .

dialogue type : s
B :  And there 's gonna be a host of those .

dialogue type : s
B :  But structurally it seemed like the things the main things that that we brought up that , uh , are are gonna need to get worked on seriously are , uh , uh , a a significantly better VAD , uh , putting the neural net on , um , which , you know , we haven't been doing anything with , the , uh , neural net at the end there , and , uh , the , uh , opening up the second front .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yeah , yeah , I mean , cuz we we have we have , uh , uh , half the the , uh , data rate that they allow .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And , uh , so the initial thing which came from , uh , the meeting that we had down south was , uh , that , um , we 'll initially just put in a mel spectrum as the second one .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's , you know , cheap , easy .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's a question about exactly how we do it .

dialogue type : s
B :  We probably will go to something better later ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but the initial thing is that cepstra and spectra behave differently ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so .

dialogue type : fh|sj
B :  Um , I think Tony Robinson used to do I was saying this before . I think he used to do mel , uh , spectra and mel cepstra .

dialogue type : s
B :  He used them as alternate features .

dialogue type : s
B :  Put them together .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  Although you you know , you haven't tested it actually on the German and Danish ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  have you ?

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  When you 're saying second , you 're comparing to the numbers that the , uh that the best system before got on , uh also without German and Danish ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Well ranking didn't before , but I 'm just asking where this is to where theirs was without the German and Danish ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  Oh , we were also esp essentially second , although there were there were I mean , we had a couple systems and they had a couple systems .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so , I guess by that we were third ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  but I mean , there were two systems that were pretty close , that came from the same place .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , so institutionally we were we were second , with , uh , the third third system .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : h|s^nd
B :  Uh , no I think it 's also institutional ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  isn't it ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : sj.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Oh , are we ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Is it ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , so so basically they 're all they 're all pretty close .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And and , um , you know , in some sense we 're all doing fairly similar things .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , I mean , one could argue about the LDA and so forth

dialogue type : s
B :  but I I think , you know , in a lot of ways we 're doing very similar things .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : fg|qy^bu^rt
B :  Um , why are we using half ?

dialogue type : fg|%-
B :  Well , so you could you c

dialogue type : sj
B :  Yeah , so I I think uh , you guys are closer to it than me , so correct me if I 'm wrong , but I I think that what 's going on is that in in both cases , some kind of normalization is done to deal with convola convolutional effects .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , they have some cepstral modification ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  In our case we have a couple things .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  We have the on - line normalization and then we have the LDA RASTA .

dialogue type : s
B :  And they seem to comple complement each other enough and be different enough that they both seem to help help us .

dialogue type : s
B :  But in any event , they 're both doing the same sort of thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  But there 's one difference .

dialogue type : s
B :  The LDA RASTA , uh , throws away high modulation frequencies .

dialogue type : s
B :  And they 're not doing that .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that if you throw away high modulation frequencies , then you can downsample .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ar
B :  I think it doesn't affect it ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  does it ?

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So I think the thing is , since we 're not evidently throwing away useful information , let 's try to put in some useful information .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And , uh , so I you know , we we 've found in a lot of ways for quite a while that having a second stream uh , helps a lot .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that 's that 's put in , and you know , it may even end up with mel spectrum even though I 'm saying I think we could do much better , just because it 's simple .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s
B :  And you know , in the long run having something everybody will look at and say , " oh , yeah , I understand " , is is very helpful .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , that 's a question .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , we were talking about that .

dialogue type : s
B :  It looks like it 'd be straightforward to to , uh , remove the noise ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um , and , uh ,

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  So , I mean , to do it after the mel conversion uh , after the noise removal , after the mel conversion .

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's even a question in my mind anyhow of whether th you should take the log or not .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : sj
B :  I sort of think you should ,

dialogue type : s^no
B :  but I don't know .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Right .

dialogue type : h
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : h|qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Well , but normalizing spectra instead of cepstra ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , probably .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Some kind would be good .

dialogue type : qh^rt
B :  You know ?

dialogue type : sj
B :  I would think .

dialogue type : qr^bu^d
B :  If you do or don't normalize ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Yes , so I mean , one would think that you would want to normalize .

dialogue type : %--
B :  But I I w w

dialogue type : s^co
B :  My thought is , uh , particularly if you take the log , try it .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then if if normalization helps , then y you have something to compare against , and say , " OK , this much effect " I mean , you don't want to change six things and then see what happens .

dialogue type : s
B :  You want to change them one at a time .

dialogue type : s
B :  So adding this other stream in , that 's simple in some way .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  And then saying , oh uh particularly because we 've found in the past there 's all these these these different results you get with slight modifications of how you do normalization .

dialogue type : s
B :  Normalization 's a very tricky , sensitive thing and you learn a lot .

dialogue type : fh|sj^cs
B :  So , I would think you would wanna have some baseline that says , " OK , we don't normalize , this is what we get " , when we do this normalization , when we do that normalization .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : sj
B :  So I think ultimately we 'll wind up doing some normalization .

dialogue type : s
B :  I agree .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  No , it 's in parallel .

dialogue type : s
B :  We 're not talking about computation time here .

dialogue type : s
B :  We 're ta I think we 're pretty far out .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's just in terms of what data it 's depending on .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's depending on the same data as the other .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's in parallel .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , there 's the delays and the storage ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : sj
B :  But I don't think the storage is so big for that .

dialogue type : sj
B :  I think th the biggest we 've run into for storage is the neural net .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : fh|s:qy
B :  And so I guess the issue there is , are we are we using neural - net - based TRAPS ,

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  and and how big are they ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So that 'll that 'll be , you know , an issue .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Maybe they can be little ones .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Mini - TRAPS .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Right .

dialogue type : sj
B :  And maybe for VAD they would be OK .

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  That 's true .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Or a simple neural net ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , the thing is , if you 're doing correlation , you 're just doing a simple uh , uh uh , dot product , you know , with some weights which you happened to learn from this learn from the data .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And so ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  uh , putting a nonlinearity on it is , you know , not that big a deal .

dialogue type : s
B :  It certainly doesn't take much space .

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  So , uh , the question is , how complex a function do you need ?

dialogue type : s:qy
B :  Do you need to have an added layer or something ?

dialogue type : s
B :  In which case , uh , potentially , you know , it could be big .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , uh ,

dialogue type : fh|qw^rt^t^tc
B :  uh So what 's next ?

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Maybe s s remind us .

dialogue type : s
B :  What to freeze and then what to do after we froze .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  And like I was saying , I think the you know , the basic directions are , uh , uh I mean , there 's lots of little things , such as improve the noise estimator but the bigger things are adding on the neural net and , uh , the second stream . And then , uh , improving the VAD .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : b.x
B :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Right .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : qy.%--
B :  Have you ever ?

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Very good question .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Have you ever worked with the Mississippi State h uh , software ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well you you may be called upon to help , uh , uh , on account of , uh , all the work in this stuff here has been , uh , with small vocabulary .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Do we already have it ?

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Maybe you could , uh , point it at Chuck ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  and and , you know , iron out hassles that that you have to , uh , tweak Joe about or whatever ,

dialogue type : s
B :  because you 're more experienced with running the large vocabulary stuff .

dialogue type : %-
B :  S

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , so I th th certainly the thing that I would want to know about is whether we get really hurt , uh , on in insertion penalty , language model , scaling , sorts of things .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s^co
B :  Uh , in which case , um , H Hari or Hynek will need to , you know , push the case more about about this .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
B :  Yes . In this case ,

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  that 's right .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
B :  That 's right .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh . But , um .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , the other thing is that even though it 's months away , uh , it 's starting to seem to me now like November fifteenth is right around the corner .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And , um , if they haven't decided things like this , like what the parameters are gonna be for this , uh , when " deciding " is not just somebody deciding . I mean , in fact there should be some understanding behind the , uh , deciding , which means some experiments and and so forth . It it it seems pretty tight to me .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's when the evaluation is .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B :  So , yeah , so

dialogue type : s
B :  after But , you know , they may even decide in the end to push it off .

dialogue type : s
B :  It wouldn't , you know , entirely surprise me .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  But , uh , due to other reasons , like some people are going away , I 'm I 'm hoping it 's not pushed off for a l a long while .

dialogue type : s
B :  That would be , uh put us in an awkward position .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  Anyway .

dialogue type : b
B :  Great .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Yeah , I think that 'll be helpful .

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's there 's not anybody OGI currently who 's who 's , uh , working with this

dialogue type : %--
B :  and and

dialogue type : sj
B :  I I think it 's it 's , um it depends how badly you do .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  I mean , I think that it it is Uh .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , I mean , it 's it 's Conceptually , it my impression , again , you guys correct me if I 'm wrong , but my impression is that , um , they want it as a double check .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  That you haven't come across you haven't invented features which are actually gonna do badly for a a significantly different task , particularly one with larger vocabulary .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And , um , but it 's not the main emphasis .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , the truth is , most of the applications they 're looking at are pretty small vocabulary .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's it 's a double check .

dialogue type : s
B :  So they 'll probably assign it some sort of low weight .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , I mean , we 'll we 'll we 'll see what they come up with .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , but in in the current thing , for instance , where you have this well - matched , moderately - matched , and and mis highly - mismatched , uh , the emphasis is somewhat on the on the well - matched , but it 's only a a marginal ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's like forty , thirty - five , twenty - five , or something like that .

dialogue type : s
B :  So you still if you were way , way off on the highly - mismatched , it would have a big effect .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And , um , it wouldn't surprise me if they did something like that with this .

dialogue type : s
B :  So again , if you 're if you get If it doesn't help you much , uh , for noisy versions of this of large vocabulary data , then , uh , you know , it may not hurt you that much .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  That 's it .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  So we have the data , just not the recognizer .

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  OK .

dialogue type : h|s
B :  Uh , well there 's training and test ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  No , I mean , if it 's like the other things , there 's there 's data for training the H M Ms and and data for testing it .

dialogue type : fh|%--

dialogue type : s

B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|sj
B :  Yeah . I mean , I wouldn't imagine that the amount of testing data was that huge .

dialogue type : sj
B :  They probably put training uh , almost certain they put training data there too .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Maybe not .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  That 's that .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt^t
B :  Anybody have anything else ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Oh , well that 's pretty soon .

dialogue type : s
B :  You know , their their They have a lot of options in their recognizer and and the SVM is one of the things they 've done with it , but it 's not their more standard thing .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  For the most part it 's it 's Gaussian mixtures .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , the SVM thing was an HMM also .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : qw.%
B :  what ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah , um .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  You know Joe ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Just to sort of ask him about the issue of , um , different features having different kinds of , uh , scaling characteristics and so on .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that , you know , w w possibly having entirely different optimal values for for the usual twiddle factors

dialogue type : qw
B :  and what 's what 's the plan about that ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Is that OK ?

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
B :  Uh , yeah , and just , um , se maybe see .

dialogue type : qy.%-
B :  Do you have Hari 's , uh ?

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Yeah , so maybe just CC Hari and say that you 've just been asked to handle the large vocabulary part here ,

dialogue type : %-
B :  and , uh , you know ,

dialogue type : h
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : qh^cs:s
B :  Why don't you just ask Joe but CC Hari , and then in the note say , " Hari , hopefully this is OK with you " .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then if Joe feels like he needs a confirmation , Hari can answer it .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  That way you can get started asking Joe quickly while he 's while he 's maybe still , you know , putting in nails and screws and

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Have you thought about how long would be uh , most useful for you to go up to OGI ?

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bu^d
B :  Oh , so you 're you 're imagining more that you would come back here first for a while and then and then go up there ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , it 's to you .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I ju you guys are

dialogue type : fh|s^co
B :  Well , y anyway , you don't have to decide this second but thi think about it about what what you would think would be the the best way to work it . I 'll

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  support it either way , so .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  Got anything to tell us ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy
B :  Are you looking at these in narrow bands ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Cuz that 's what you 're gonna be using ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , I mean , it seems somehow that needs th uh , there 's a couple things that I wonder about with this .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , so one is is , again , looking at the same representation ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I mean , if you 're going for this sort of thing where you have uh , little detectors that are looking at narrow bands , then what you 're going to be looking for should be some category that you can find with the narrow bands .

dialogue type : s
B :  That that seems to be kind of fundamental to it .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , and then the other thing , uh , is that I wonder about with it , and and don't take this in the wrong way , like I I know what I 'm doing or anything ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  but , I mean . Um , just wondering really .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , the sort of standard answer about this sort of thing is that if you 're trying to find the right system in some sense , whether you 're trying by categories or or parameters um , and your goal is discrimination , then having choices based on discrimination as opposed to , um , unsupervised nearness of things , um , is actually better .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , and I don't know if that I mean , since you 're dealing with issues of robustness , you know , maybe maybe this isn't right , but it 'd be something I 'd be concerned about .

dialogue type : qy^d^df^f^rt
B :  Because , for instance , you can imagine , uh , uh , i i if you remember from from , uh from your your quals , John Ohala saying that , uh , " buh " and " puh " differed , uh , not really cuz of voicing but because of aspiration .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , in as far as wha what 's really there in the acoustics .

dialogue type : fh|sj
B :  So , um , if you looked if you were doing some coarse clustering , you probably would put those two sounds together .

dialogue type : sj
B :  And yet , I would gue I would guess that many of your recognition errors were coming from , uh , um , pfft , screwing up on this distinction .

dialogue type : fh|sj
B :  So , in fact , it 's a little hard because recognizers , to first order , sort of work .

dialogue type : s
B :  And the reasons we 're doing the things we 're doing is because they don't work as well as we 'd like .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  if you go and take any recognizer that 's already out there and you say , " how well is it distinguishing between schwas and stops ? "

dialogue type : sj
B :  Boy , I bet they 're all doing nearly perfectly on this ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So these these big categories that differ in huge obvious ways , we already know how to do .

dialogue type : qh
B :  So , what are we bringing to the party ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , in fact what we wanna do is have something that , particularly in the presence of noise , uh , is better at distinguishing between , uh , categories that are actually close to one another , and hence , would probably be clustered together .

dialogue type : sj
B :  So that 's th that 's the hard thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , I understand that there 's this other constraint that you 're considering , is that you wanna have categories that , uh that would be straightforward for , say , a human being to mark if you had manual annotation .

dialogue type : s
B :  And it 's something that you really think you can pick up .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
B :  But I think it 's also essential that you wanna look at what are the confusions that you 're making and how can you come up with , uh , categories that , uh , can clarify these confusions .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , I mean , the standard sort of way of doing that is take a look at the algorithms you 're looking at , but then throw in some discriminative aspect to it .

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  Y y this is more like , you know , how does LDA differ from PCA ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , they 're the same sort of thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  They 're both orthogonalizing .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  and and , um , this is a little harder because you 're not just trying to find parameters . You 're actually trying to find the the the the categories themselves .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , so a little more like brain surgery , I think

dialogue type : s^e
B :  on yourself .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , uh

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  anyway . That 's my thought .

dialogue type : s
B :  You 've been thinking about this problem for a long time actually .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , well W actually , you stopped thinking about it for a long time , but you used to think about it a lot .

dialogue type : s
B :  And you 've been thinking about it more now ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  these categories .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , here 's a here 's a , uh , uh Here 's a generic and possibly useless thought , which is , um , what do you really I mean , in a sense the only s s systems that make sense , uh , are ones that that have something from top - down in th in them .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Because if e even the smallest organism that 's trying to learn to do anything , if it doesn't have any kind of reward for doing or penal penalty for doing anything , then it 's just going to behave randomly .

dialogue type : s
B :  So whether you 're talking about something being learned through evolution or being learned through experience , it 's gotta have something come down to it that gives its reward or , you know , at least some reinforcement learning ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : %-
B :  And

dialogue type : s^aa|sj
B :  Right , but I me I I think that maybe in some ways part of the difficulty is is trying to deal with the with these phonemes .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bsc^cs
B :  correction if our metric of badness is word error rate then , um , maybe we should be looking at words .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , for for for very nice , uh , reasons we 've looked for a while at syllables , and they have a lot of good properties ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but i i i if you go all the way to words , I mean , that 's really I mean , d w In many applications you wanna go further .

dialogue type : s
B :  You wanna go to concepts or something , or have have have concepts , actions , this sort of thing .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But ,

dialogue type : s^na
B :  words aren't bad , yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B :  And and

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^nd
B :  But but but we 're not trying for models of words here .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I mean , what you wanna do is is build up these categories that are that are best for word recognition .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , we do this every day in this very gross way of of running o a thousand experiments

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because we have fast computers and picking the thing that has the best word error rate .

dialogue type : s
B :  In some way I mean , we derive that all the time .

dialogue type : sj
B :  In some ways it 's really not a bad bad thing to do

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because it tells you in fact how your adjustments at the very low level affect the the final goal .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
B :  Um , so maybe there 's a way to even put that in in a much more automatic way ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  where you take , you know , something about the error at the level of the word or some other it could be syllable but in some large unit ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  uh , and uh yeah , you may not have word models , you have phone models , whatever ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but you sort of don't worry about that , and just somehow feed it back through .

dialogue type : s
B :  You know , so that 's , uh , wh what I called a useless comments because I 'm not really telling you how to do it .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  But I mean , it 's a it 's it 's , you know it

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj.%--
B :  Now , that being said , I think that that if you have something that is , um i

dialogue type : s
B :  Once you start dealing with spontaneous speech , all the things you 're saying are are really true .

dialogue type : s
B :  If you have read speech that 's been manually annotated , like TIMIT , then , you know , i i you the phones are gonna be right , actually , for the most part .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
B :  So so , uh , it doesn't really hurt them to to do that , to put in discrimination at that level .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , if you go to spontaneous speech then it 's it 's trickier

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  and , um And it won't allow for the overlapping phenomenon

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , we when y when you start looking at these kind of results I think it usually is is pretty intuitive ,

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  but start looking at um , what are the kinds of confusions that you do make , uh , you know , between words if you want or or or , uh , even phones in in in in read speech , say , uh , when there is noise .

dialogue type : s:qy
B :  You know , so is it more across place or more across manner ?

dialogue type : s.%--:qy.%--
B :  Or is it cor you know , is it ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , I know one thing that happens is that you you you , uh , you lose the , um , uh , low energy phones .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , if there 's added noise then low energy phones sometimes don't get heard .

dialogue type : s
B :  And if that if that is if it uh , if that turns it into another word or or different you know , or another pair of words or something , then it 's more likely to happen .

dialogue type : fh|sj.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^no
B :  W I don't know .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Oh , sure , that 's really big .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
B :  Uh , but I mean , even if you do um , uh , diagnostic rhyme test kind of things , you know , where there really isn't an any information like that , uh , people are still better in noise than they than they are in in , uh uh , than the machines are .

dialogue type : %--
B :  So , I mean , that 's i

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Right . We can't we can't get it at all without any language models .

dialogue type : s
B :  Language models are there and important

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
B :  If we 're not working on that then we should work on something else and improve it ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  but especially if it looks like the potential is there .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : qy^rt^t^tc
B :  Should we do some digits ?

dialogue type : s^df^rt
B :  Since we 're here ?

dialogue type : z
B :  OK .

dialogue type : z
B :  That 's all folks .
