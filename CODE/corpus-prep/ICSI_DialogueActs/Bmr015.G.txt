dialogue type : z
G :  I do .

dialogue type : z
G :  I crashed when I started this morning .

dialogue type : z
G :  Really ?

dialogue type : z
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
G :  Maybe , yeah .

dialogue type : z
G :  Or maybe it 's once you 've done enough meetings it won't crash on you anymore .

dialogue type : z
G :  It 's a matter of experience .

dialogue type : z
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
G :  Did

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Did they send , uh , the messages to you about the meeting today ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
G :  OK , cuz I checked my mail . I didn't have anything .

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  Oh , you 're talking about where they completely read the wrong string and didn't correct it ?

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
G :  Ah .

dialogue type : qw
G :  Well how many are how how often does that happen ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
G :  Oh , so it 's not very much .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Seems like we should just change the transcripts

dialogue type : s^e
G :  to match .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|qw
G :  So you um , how many digits have been transcribed now ?

dialogue type : qh^bk^d
G :  Four thousand lines ?

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Wow .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
G :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
G :  u

dialogue type : s
G :  Tomorrow .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  It 'll be interesting to see the reviewer 's comments .

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's just from his message it sounded like that .

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  there was a sentence at the end of one of his paragraphs

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
G :  He said the next phase 'll be very , competitive

dialogue type : s
G :  because we didn't want to weed out much in the first phase .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I don't I don't know .

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I don't remember .

dialogue type : qo
G :  If we end up getting this , um , what will it mean to ICSI in terms of , w wh where will the money go to ,

dialogue type : qw^e
G :  what would we be doing with it ?

dialogue type : qw
G :  I I mean uh which part is ICSI though .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
G :  Dang !

dialogue type : s^bu
G : 

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
G :  to continue the research on the Meeting Recorder stuff ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right , right .

dialogue type : qo^rt
G :  So assuming everybody 's completely busy now , it means we 're gonna hafta , hire more students , or , something ?

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b.x
G :  I see .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
G :  Cuz of digits .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  That sounds good .

dialogue type : qy
G :  Is is this the algorithm where you hypothesize a fundamental , and then get the energy for all the harmonics of that fundamental ?

dialogue type : s^e
G : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
G :  Do you hafta do some kind of , uh , low - pass filter before you do that ?

dialogue type : qrr.%-
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G :  But i

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  But the harmonics are gonna be ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  uh , uh ,

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I don't know what the right word is .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  they 're gonna be dampened by the uh , vocal tract ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  right ?

dialogue type : s^e
G :  The response of the vocal tract .

dialogue type : qy.%-
G :  And so just looking at the energy on those at the harmonics , is that gonna ?

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  I m what you 'd like to do is get rid of the effect of the vocal tract .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^e
G :  And just look at the at at the signal coming out of the glottis .

dialogue type : b
G :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
G :  Uh - uh .

dialogue type : s^aap
G :  An - any application may have to .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
G :  Yeah , I I think , um , one possible way that we could handle it is that ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  you know , as the transcribers are going through , and if they get a hunk of speech that they 're gonna transcribe ,

dialogue type : s
G :  u th they 're gonna transcribe it because there 's words in there or whatnot .

dialogue type : s
G :  If there 's a breath in there , they could transcribe that .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
G :  Right . But if there 's a big hunk of speech , let 's say on Morgan 's mike where he 's not talking at all , um , don't don't worry about that .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So for the chunks that are transcribed , everything 's transcribed .

dialogue type : s
G :  But outside of those boundaries , there could have been stuff that wasn't transcribed .

dialogue type : s
G :  So you just somebody can't rely on that data and say " that 's perfectly clean data " .

dialogue type : qy
G :  Uh do you see what I 'm saying ?

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  So I would say don't tell them to transcribe anything that 's outside of a grouping of words .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  one of the ways that we will be able to get rid of breath is by having models for them .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , that 's what a lot of people do nowadays .

dialogue type : s
G :  And so in order to build the model you need to have some amount of it marked ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  so that you know where the boundaries are .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , I don't think we need to worry a lot about breaths that are happening outside of a , you know , conversation .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  We don't have to go and search for them to to mark them at all ,

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  but , I mean , if they 're there while they 're transcribing some hunk of words , I 'd say put them in if possible .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Mm - hmm .
