dialogue type : s^ba
F :  I don't like that term .

dialogue type : s^r

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Hmm . Interesting .

dialogue type : %
F :  Wow .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's interesting .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Did it get rid of other stuff , too , though ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Did it get rid of other stuff besides the speech ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Wow . Interesting .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Wow .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Wow . Interesting .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  I wanna ask , um So , you know that the data I ' v I have upgraded it considerably .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So I 've probably made I probably corrected something like ,

dialogue type : %--
F :  well , s

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's really a substantial amount of things that I 've caught , changed um , added to it .

dialogue type : s
F :  Including a lot of , uh , backchannels .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  So . If you if you run it on the new version , then the numbers will be um , and you compare it to the to runs on the old version , then you 're gonna end up with more of an improvement than would actually be the case .

dialogue type : qy^2^bu^d^rt
F :  As of February ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  So a l Like the HLT paper ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  OK . Well , so long as you have the same baseline , then you 'll be able to tell .

dialogue type : s
F :  So long as i so long as it 's the same baseline you 'll be able to tell .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  But but I 'm just gonn I 'm just saying that if you were to compare that with running that on the new data , that it would be an a more optimistic outcome .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Mmm . I did .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That sounds great .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah . I mean , t y I was thinking , th the other day , that this is not just conversational speech .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  The fact that is has so much technological jargon in it . I it makes it u considerably harder to , um me e e e to transcribe and to to double check and all those things .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , I think you 're gonna find a substantial gain in terms of the word ac accuracy .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  So long as those words are in your vocabulary .

dialogue type : s^aap
F :  Well , all of them are . All of our all of our meetings have a lot of jargon in them . But we know what those words are .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I mean , I don't know how you get them into the vocabulary ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^tc:s
F :  Now , I have to I have to I really need to , uh , raise a question about the term " cheating " .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
F :  And the reason is , um , if I understand that , " cheating " is a term which is used to apply for basically what all of linguistics corpus linguistics does , and what what my transcribers are doing and what I do , which is a methodology whereby you actually physically mark things in the data .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Like the transcription ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  like the words that are actually there .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
F :  OK . I mean , that that part is OK .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  But I but I do wonder sometimes if it might be possible to use a term that 's a little bit less evaluative , like , um , " hand - marked " .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs^rt
F :  OK . I guess what I 'm I 'm thinking , is just in if uh , when these are presented in an inte interdisciplinary context , it might be nice to add that explanation ?

dialogue type : s^df^rt
F :  Cuz otherwise it sounds like a pejorative statement on an alternative methodology ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Cuz it sounds like it sort of devalues the the , um , all other approach , which is to to put those distinctions in .

dialogue type : s^m^na
F :  They can do experiments .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs^ng
F :  Yeah , it just seems like , you know , i if it were " bootstrapping " , or if it were I mean , there are other ways to maybe get the point across .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Hu - Well . OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK . Alright .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK . OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I can understand it in context as you described it .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  It has shock value ,

dialogue type : %--
F :  and

dialogue type : s
F :  to the wr to the wrong audience , I think that that might be t a negative shock .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs
F :  Yeah . We started with hand - marked data , or with , uh , t you know , hand - transcribed data ,

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy
F :  Did you break the microphone ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Nnn . OK .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
F :  OK . Well , I feel better now .

dialogue type : s^ft^tc
F :  Thank you very much .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  you know , I understand it in that context ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but it but it is almost resentful .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's almost like , you know , resentful of the data , resentful of the , um , the hard work that 's going into preparing the data

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK . OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Oh , interesting .

dialogue type : s^df^no
F :  I didn't know that .

dialogue type : s^fe
F :  Huh !

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh !

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba^na
F :  Oh , sure . Terminology is always context dependent .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  No question about it .

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I didn't realize .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  This is interesting what what Adam said about it being used also for a bunch of other , uh , dimensions .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Interesting .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Interesting .

dialogue type : x
F :  Huh !

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Interesting .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  Well . The term itself is .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  You know ?

dialogue type : s^df^nd
F :  But but it And it 's pejorative with respect to a certain purpose .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  I understand .

dialogue type : s
F :  I I wanted to raise the issue .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^m^na
F :  Anyway .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
F :  OK . That 's interesting . OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , I wanted to raise the issue ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  and um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I I , uh I appreciate the discussion .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
F :  I wanted to ask one other question which is a different matter ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  which is with respect to , um , this thing that you 've been r working on for the recording monitoring script ?

dialogue type : s
F :  So . The idea You had this script that you 're working on , to be sure that the microphone values are in are kept in ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK . OK .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  Well , I was just wondering if i i

dialogue type : s
F :  Because I I am finding that , um , in double checking , I 've run across , u um , one data set where the microphone was off early on ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and then two other speakers their microphones went off later .

dialogue type : s
F :  And this is out of , like , seven speakers .

dialogue type : s
F :  So out of seven speakers , four microphones Y you know , basically , three three microphones bak basically flaked ,

dialogue type : s
F :  which makes it hard for the data to be used for all possible purposes .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  That 's what I think .

dialogue type : s
F :  I think the two that flaked late , I think it was the battery .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , I don't know if there 's a way to replace a battery , if it happens in the middle of a meeting .

dialogue type : s^am
F :  Maybe that 's hopeless anyway .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
F :  OK . Then I guess that raises the question of , uh , whether we should screen the data before they get transcribed .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because , although I think that the data are still useful in terms of providing content ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and and that , I know that having three out of seven microphones out of commission during some part of the meeting restricts the , uh , usefulness of the data for other purposes .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  So , we have some part of that .

dialogue type : %-
F :  I c

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , there the And the other aspect of it is , um , that , when the microphone is not well - adjusted , then y i i even if it 's not a lapel mike , you can get lapel mike type behavior .

dialogue type : s
F :  Cuz I 'm I 'm expecting , for example , with this , that you 're gonna end up , you know , picking up other peoples ' signals .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah . I mean , it 's just you know , the microphone is intended for certain adjustments .

dialogue type : s
F :  The only argument for doing so would be with reference to the content . Content maps .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Uh but mayb maybe then it should be done in the old original way ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
F :  w instead of channelizing and having the , uh , uh , you know , elaborate coding of the backchannels .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^no.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Well , someone who 's associated with the meeting could have , like , a summary of points handled in the meeting .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  You know , maybe if we could pay one person who knows that subject matter to do an outline of the meeting 's content .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Instead of losing the content altogether .

dialogue type : s^ba^ng
F :  I guess the troub trouble in my mind is that it that it 's not a very neat corpus

dialogue type : s:s
F :  if you say " these data are available ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  but these are imperfect ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  because of the f you know , the batteries flaked . "

dialogue type : s
F :  And we have so many .

dialogue type : s
F :  We have such a backlog . I mean , to be able to get through the backlog of the of the good meetings , it would be nice to not have energies diverted .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  That 's fine .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
F :  Oh , good question .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yep . Yep .
