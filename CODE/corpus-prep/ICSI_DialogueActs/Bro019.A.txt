dialogue type : z
A :  wireless headset ?

dialogue type : z
A :  OK .

A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , I need a little orientation about this environment and uh scr s how to run some jobs here

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because I never d did anything so far with this X emissions

dialogue type : fh
A :  So ,

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  I think maybe I 'll ask you after the meeting .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  sure

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : h
A :  Um .

dialogue type : h
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h
A :  So ,

dialogue type : qy.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^no.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  Uh , I think I 'll start from the post uh Aurora submission maybe .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh , yeah ,

dialogue type : s
A :  after the submission the what I 've been working on mainly was to take take other s submissions

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  and then

dialogue type : s
A :  over their system , what they submitted ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because we didn't have any speech enhancement system in in ours .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So I tried

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  And u First I tried just LDA .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  And then I found that

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , if if I combine it with LDA , it gives @ @ improvement over theirs .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
A :  So ,

dialogue type : s
A :  just just the LDA filters .

dialogue type : s
A :  I just plug in I just take the cepstral coefficients coming from their system and then plug in LDA on top of that .

dialogue type : s
A :  But the LDA filter that I used was different from what we submitted in the proposal .

dialogue type : s
A :  What I did was I took the LDA filter 's design using clean speech ,

dialogue type : fh|s^df
A :  uh , mainly because the speech is already cleaned up after the enhancement

dialogue type : s
A :  so , instead of using this , uh , narrow narrow band LDA filter that we submitted uh , I got new filters .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So

dialogue type : s
A :  that seems to be giving uh , improving over their uh , system .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Slightly .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  But , not very significantly .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  And uh , that was

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , showing any improvement over final by plugging in an LDA .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so then after after that I I added uh , on - line normalization also on top of that .

dialogue type : s
A :  And that there there also I n I found that I have to make some changes to their time constant that I used

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because th it has a a mean and variance update time constant

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and which is not suitable for the enhanced speech , and whatever we try it on with proposal - one .

dialogue type : fh
A :  But um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I didn't I didn't play with that time constant a lot ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I just t g

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , I have to increase the time constant , or reduce the value of the update value .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's all I found

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So I have to .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , the other other thing what I tried was , I just um , uh , took the baseline and then ran it with the endpoint inf uh th information ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  just the Aurora baseline ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  to see that how much the baseline itself improves

dialogue type : s^e
A :  by just supplying the information of the I mean the w speech and nonspeech .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I found that the baseline itself improves by twenty - two percent by just giving the wuh .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No .

dialogue type : s^ar^r
A :  No .

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  No , things didn't get better with the same time constant that we used .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  I mean , I didn't get an improvement over not using on - line normalization ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because I I found that I would have change the value of the update factor .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  But I didn't play it with play play quite a bit to make it better than .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , the on - line normalization didn't give me any improvement .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And uh ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  oh yeah

dialogue type : s
A :  So I just stopped there with the uh , speech enhancement .

dialogue type : s
A :  The the other thing what I tried was the adding the uh , endpoint information to the baseline

dialogue type : s
A :  and that itself gives like twenty - two percent

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because the the second the new phase is going to be with the endpointed speech .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah

dialogue type : s^na
A :  that 's , that 's what the feeling is like .

dialogue type : s
A :  They 're going to give the endpoint information .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
A :  So ,

dialogue type : h
A : 

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No .

dialogue type : s^ar^r
A :  No .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
A :  Yeah , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  exactly .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  I guess that is that is where the consensus is .

dialogue type : s
A :  Like y you will you will You 'll be given the information about the beginning and the end of speech

dialogue type : s
A :  but the whole speech is available to you .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , it improves by twenty - two percent .

dialogue type : s
A :  I found that in s one of the SpeechDat - Car cases , that like , the Spanish one improves by just fifty percent by just putting the endpoint .

dialogue type : %--
A :  w

dialogue type : s^e
A :  I mean you don't need any further speech enhancement with fifty .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So , uh ,

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
A :  Yeah , by fifty percent .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  so that is when uh , the the qualification criteria was reduced from fifty percent to something like twenty - five percent for well - matched .

dialogue type : s
A :  And I think they have they have actually changed their qualification c criteria now .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And uh ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I guess after that , I just went home f I just had a vacation fo for four weeks .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh .

dialogue type : %--
A :  Ye

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and I I came back and I started working on uh , some other speech enhancement algorithm .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , so I from the submission what I found that people have tried spectral subtraction and Wiener filtering . These are the main uh , approaches where people have tried ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so just to just to fill the space with some f few more speech enhancement algorithms to see whether it improves a lot , I I 've been working on this uh , signal subspace approach for speech enhancement

dialogue type : s^e
A :  where you take the noisy signal and then decomposing the signal s and the noise subspace

dialogue type : s
A :  and then try to estimate the clean speech from the signal plus noise subspace .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So , I 've been actually running some s

dialogue type : s
A :  So far I 've been trying it only on Matlab .

dialogue type : s
A :  I have to to to test whether it works first or not

dialogue type : s
A :  and then I 'll p port it to C

dialogue type : s
A :  and I 'll update it with the repository once I find it it giving any some positive result .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s^ar
A :  Uh , no

dialogue type : s^arp
A :  there is a slight different .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , which are extracted at the handset

dialogue type : s^df
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  The speech .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^df
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because they use exactly the baseline system for converting the cepstrum once you have the speech .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , if we are using our own code for th I mean that that could be the only difference .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , there is no other difference .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Only LDA .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Af - I after that I added on - line normalization ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Yeah , I assume .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  without any change .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : %-
A :  with

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh yeah ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean the the new LDA filters .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Because the your improvement on HM and MM will also go down significantly in the spreadsheet

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean the well - matched may be the one which is least affected by adding the endpoint information .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  MM and HM are going to be v hugely affected by it .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  But they d the everything I mean is like ,

dialogue type : %--
A :  but there

dialogue type : s
A :  that 's how they reduce why they reduce the qualification to twenty - five percent or some something on .

dialogue type : h|s^ar
A :  Uh , no ,

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  I guess they are going ahead with the same weighting .

dialogue type : b.%
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  Usual .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
A :  Yeah , but actually the well well the well - matched

dialogue type : fh
A :  um ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean the the well - matched condition is not like , uh , the one in TI - digits

dialogue type : s^e
A :  where uh , you have all the training , uh , conditions exactly like replicated in the testing condition also .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's like , this is not calibrated by SNR or something .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aap
A :  has has also some slight mismatches ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  unlike the TI - digits where it 's like prefectly matched

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because it 's artificially added noise .

dialogue type : s
A :  But this is natural recording .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  the the well - matched is defined like it 's seventy percent of the whole database is used for training and thirty percent for testing .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  Yeah because the m the main major reason for the m

dialogue type : s
A :  the main mismatch is coming from the amount of noise and the silence frames and all those present in the database actually .

dialogue type : %--
A :  No

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I guess if you want to reconstruct the speech , it may be a good idea to do it on FFT bins .

dialogue type : s
A :  But for speech recognition , it may not .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I mean it may not be very different if you do it on mel warped or whether you do it on FFT .

dialogue type : s
A :  So you 're going to do a linear weighting anyway after that .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s
A :  So , it may not be really a big different .

dialogue type : %-
A :  It

dialogue type : b
A :  I Uh - huh .

dialogue type : z
A :  So

dialogue type : s^tc
A :  The other thing is like when you 're putting in a speech enhancement technique ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh ,

dialogue type : qy
A :  is it like one stage speech enhancement ?

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Because everybody seems to have a mod two stages of speech enhancement in all the proposals ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  which is really giving them some improvement .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean they just do the same thing again once more .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I mean , to cleaning it up once more .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
A :  That 's what

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  That 's wh

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
A :  So ,

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^tc
A :  So I 've been thinking about combining the Wiener filtering with signal subspace ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I mean just to see all some some such permutation combination to see whether it really helps or not .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  The signal subspace ?

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  The signal subspace approach has actually an in - built Wiener filtering in it .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  It is like a KL transform followed by a Wiener filter .

dialogue type : s
A :  Is the signal is is a signal substrate .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  the c the the advantage of combining two things is mainly coming from the signal subspace approach doesn't work very well if the SNR is very bad .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  it works very poorly with the poor SNR conditions , and in colored noise .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Wiener filtering .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  It 's a it 's a cascade of two s

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that that 's one reason maybe we could combine

dialogue type : s^cs^df
A :  s some something to improve SNR a little bit , first stage ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  and then do a something in the second stage

dialogue type : s^e
A :  which could take it further .

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
A :  Oh , the colored noise

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  the colored noise the the v the signal subspace approach has I mean , it it actually depends on inverting the matrices .

dialogue type : %--
A :  So it it ac

dialogue type : s
A :  the covariance matrix of the noise .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So if if it is not positive definite ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  It doesn't behave very well if it is not positive definite

dialogue type : %
A :  ak

dialogue type : s
A :  It works very well with white noise because we know for sure that it has a positive definite .

dialogue type : s
A :  So the way they get around is like they do an inverse filtering ,

dialogue type : s
A :  first of the colo colored noise

dialogue type : s
A :  and then make the noise white ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and then finally when you reconstruct the speech back , you do this filtering again .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Huh ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  So .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  This VTS has been proposed by CMU ?

dialogue type : qy
A :  Is it is it the CMU ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah , yeah , OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  From C .

dialogue type : s^tc
A :  The other thing is to , uh Most of the speech enhancement techniques have reported results on small vocabulary tasks .

dialogue type : s
A :  But we we going to address this Wall Street Journal in our next stage ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  which is also going to be a noisy task

dialogue type : s
A :  so s very few people have reported something on using some continuous speech at all .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , I was looking at some literature on speech enhancement applied to large vocabulary tasks

dialogue type : fh
A :  and

dialogue type : s
A :  spectral subtraction doesn't seems to be the thing to do for large vocabulary tasks .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Always people have shown improvement with Wiener filtering and maybe subspace approach over spectral subtraction everywhere .

dialogue type : s
A :  But if we if we have to use simple spectral subtraction , we may have to do some optimization to make it work @ @ .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I m I guess Guenter Hirsch is in charge of that .

dialogue type : s
A :  Guenter Hirsch and TI .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  r Roger , maybe in charge of .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah , d

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  What one one um p one thing is like what before we started using this VAD in this Aurora , the th what we did was like , I I guess most of you know about this , adding this additional speech - silence bit to the cepstrum and training the HMM on that .

dialogue type : s
A :  That is just a binary feature

dialogue type : s
A :  and that seems to be improving a lot on the SpeechDat - Car where there is a lot of noise

dialogue type : s
A :  but not much on the TI - digits .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , a adding an additional feature to distin to discriminate between speech and nonspeech was helping .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's it .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , we actually added an additional binary feature to the cepstrum ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  just the baseline .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa^r
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , in in the case of TI - digits it didn't actually give us anything ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because there wasn't any f anything to discriminate between speech ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  and it was very short .

dialogue type : s
A :  But Italian was like very it was a huge improvement on Italian .
