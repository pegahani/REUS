dialogue type : z
C :  I think that 's recording now .

dialogue type : z
C :  Um , do it again .

dialogue type : z
C :  That 's uh That 's in channel one .

dialogue type : z
C :  Channel one .

dialogue type : z
C :  Let me make sure .

dialogue type : z
C :  There are no There 's only one connection element .

dialogue type : z
C :  It 's zero - based .

dialogue type : z
C : 

dialogue type : z
C :  This this has the disadvantage of needing to put the numbers on the mikes .

dialogue type : z
C :  Consistently not equal to the numbers numbers on the channels .

dialogue type : z
C :  Well , you can write it down .

dialogue type : z
C :  I mean Write down whatever you like .

dialogue type : z
C :  I don't know .

dialogue type : z
C :  You can do whatever any way you like .

dialogue type : z
C :  The weird thing is that um it means that it varies when you move your head around

dialogue type : z
C :  but I think it 's probably the better solution .

dialogue type : z
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : z
C :  Do we have the numbers ? the the sheets , that we did from last time ?

dialogue type : z
C :  so we can do them again ?

dialogue type : z
C :  Great .

dialogue type : z
C :  I 'm on uh mike three .

dialogue type : z
C :  This is mike three ,

dialogue type : z
C :  coming in here .

dialogue type : z
C :  It 's moving around as I move my head backwards and forwards .

dialogue type : z
C :  So that 's just the way it goes .

dialogue type : z
C :  That 's life .

dialogue type : z
C :  That 's just what it does .

dialogue type : z
C :  That 's right .

dialogue type : z
C :  OK .

dialogue type : z
C :  P Z Ms ? or or not P Z

dialogue type : z
C :  Because this is PZM number three .

dialogue type : z
C :  Let 's list them in order .

dialogue type : z
C :  PZM number three was the furthest away .

dialogue type : z
C :  This is the next one in , which is PZM number four , apparently .

dialogue type : z
C :  PZ

dialogue type : z
C :  What - Can you can you see other stuff happening ?

dialogue type : z
C :  This is PZM number four .

dialogue type : z
C :  which is closest to the machine room .

dialogue type : z
C :  I mean I don't know .

dialogue type : z
C :  It 's all hopeless .

dialogue type : z
C :  This is uh one side of PDA , I guess .

dialogue type : z
C :  We could actually give these sides names ,

dialogue type : z
C :  right ?

dialogue type : z
C :  This would be left ,

dialogue type : z
C :  wouldn't it .

dialogue type : z
C :  I know ,

dialogue type : z
C :  but I 'm just asking .

dialogue type : z
C :  I wasn't asking you .

dialogue type : z
C :  This is this is PDA left .

dialogue type : z
C :  You getting something there ?

dialogue type : z
C :  And this is PDA right .

dialogue type : z
C :  They will vary in future .

dialogue type : z
C :  Because it depends which one of these shows more consistency then .

dialogue type : z
C :  No .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , we 're w we 're so ahead of the game now ,

dialogue type : s
C :  cuz we 've got built - in downsampling now .

dialogue type : s^r

dialogue type : s^e

dialogue type : z

dialogue type : z
C :  wireless headset ,

dialogue type : z

dialogue type : s^rt

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see .

dialogue type : s
C :  I I I actually have one .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  Well , Sarah has one

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because she does a lot of transcribing of interviews .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
C :  But The crazy thing is we 'd have to convert the s we 'd have to dump the audio files onto cassette . to use it .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : qw

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : qw

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  And this is Windows ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^co

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  You have You have these foot pedals but you d you 're not using them .

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^fe

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  That 's so cool .

dialogue type : fh
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fg

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So , the p I mean , what I 'm hearing is that the problem of starting off with some recordings and trying to get word transcripts is kind of I mean , it 's not a it 's not an unfamiliar problem .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So that I mean that basically , there are standard solutions and we should just adopt adopt them

dialogue type : s
C :  and it 's going to cost however much it 's going to cost ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean there 's We 're we 're probably not going to have a lot of flexibility in bringing down the cost

dialogue type : s
C :  cuz probably the low cost solution 's already been established .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so that 's just whatever it is .

dialogue type : s
C :  That 's how we 'll do it .

dialogue type : qh
C :  See what I mean ?

dialogue type : b^rt
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean the only thing is I wonder if our requirements are different from um I mean there 's than than what 's been done in the past

dialogue type : s^e
C :  than discourse analyzers

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because maybe we have different requirements in terms of time align you know , how much time aligned detail we need and uh how much detail in terms of people .

dialogue type : s
C :  I don I don't know how much ti I don't think we do need any time aligned detail .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  I think we just have basically one text file which runs from beginning to end .

dialogue type : fh.%
C :  But .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^aap
C :  But not if it costs more .

dialogue type : b^rt
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Right , I mean , the it 's sort of it 's a little In some sense it 's a little bit easier with it with Switchboard

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because the telephone is so actually people are less flexible in what they do .

dialogue type : s
C :  In this kind of situation where we 've got nonverbal channels then there 's a lot of overlap

dialogue type : s
C :  and there 's just that it 's not a very good model .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Well , every utterance is a single speaker ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's just that utterances can overlap .

dialogue type : %-
C :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s^na
C :  I think so .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Like , So , Eric made a s made a sentence , and that should be like one utterance

dialogue type : s
C :  and then I had a couple of backchannels in there

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : fg|s^ng
C :  Well , we 'll have to go in from somewhere

dialogue type : s
C :  but we can't necessarily I mean , we we may be able to get the transcriber to give them to us if we give them software

dialogue type : s^e
C :  but we may not

dialogue type : s
C :  in which case we 'll have to get them some other way ,

dialogue type : s
C :  like with forced alignment later ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean you know all this can be done .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
C :  Phoneme phoneme phoneme transcriptions .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  There 's a there are there 's a whole bunch of tools .

dialogue type : s
C :  There 's a some web page , where they have a list of like ten of them or something .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^ng
C :  No , no , no . There 's some I mean , I just there are there are a lot of a lot of @ @ these things .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
C :  Oh , EAGLES .

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , that 's the European one .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^co
C :  Just take the thing with you .

dialogue type : h|s^no
C :  Well , I don't know what will happen ,

dialogue type : s^na

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^aa|s^co.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  that 's true .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  You can leave it behind as well if you want .

dialogue type : s
C :  I I assume that these are projects where they do the whole thing ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  So they probably will have tools to address the actual the the the transcriber support

dialogue type : s
C :  and then automated alignment of what the transcribers give you ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  which is , you know , exactly the problem we have .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  But then again we don't have to do it .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  Oh sure , we are .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  We 've got individual microphones .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h
C :  Well ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yes ,

dialogue type : s
C :  although that might @ @ presumably we 'll have one we 'll have several formats that you can interconvert between .

dialogue type : s
C :  When we want to do recognition we 'll do STM ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  but if we 're rather than rather than designing our own format , we 'll just take whatever comes out of the tools that we can find to use , I think .

dialogue type : s
C :  I I I 've got no idea what that 'll look like .

dialogue type : fh
C :  but

dialogue type : s^t3
C :  on our speaker phones .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^bk^rt

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
C :  Alembic ?

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't think so .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  Because the transcriber 's put in intonational tags ?

dialogue type : s^2
C :  Or maybe not .

dialogue type : b
C :  Well .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b^rt

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  Who 's it from ?

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Is it the French one ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
C :  U Penn .

dialogue type : s
C :  I think that I 've heard of this one .

dialogue type : s^e

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Sure .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Can I see ?

dialogue type : fg|s^nd
C :  Well Well , We are going to do time alignment .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  but we 'll probably do it ourselves ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s^df
C :  So we 're not we 're not concerned about getting getting about buying and or bringing in tools .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  We 're not very good

dialogue type : s^e

dialogue type : s^r

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^co^fe

dialogue type : s^e^fe
C :  It uses Snack !

dialogue type : fh

dialogue type : s
C :  It uses Snack .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  That 's a TCL audio thing that I had some involvement with .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  If I have to use it

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm sure I 'm sure It 's a TCL - based thing .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  I 'm sure it 's just wonderful .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  Yes , T " Transcriber was developed with the scripting language TCL TK and C extensions .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  It relies on the Snack sound extension , which allows support for most common audio formats . "

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's the French one .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bd
C :  But I 've never downloaded it .

dialogue type : s
C :  Someone mentioned it to me .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  And that 's probably why they mentioned it to me ,

dialogue type : s
C :  because they thought I would be excited because it 's TCL - based .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  Oh " Deliverable D - three point one " ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Transcriber

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  That 's a fine question .

dialogue type : s^fe
C :  Wow .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So this thing , this uh deliverable D - three point one of the MATE project is a review of a lot of different tools .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  They 're actually , they seem to be more

dialogue type : s
C :  the tool the main focus of the tools is you 've already got a transcription but you 're trying to tag the different turns transi transcriptions with uh discourse roles

dialogue type : s
C :  and things like that .

dialogue type : s
C :  But I mean a lot them are tools that will also do transcription as well .

dialogue type : s
C :  And I could be wrong .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  I Uh , the stuff I did , I combined pairs of these into stereo pairs ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  listened to them in stereo .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  And I was very impressed by how well you could hear separate speakers ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but I haven't I haven't done very extensive tests .

dialogue type : s^2
C :  you get a certain amount of spatial information .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's not It 's not consistent

dialogue type : s^e
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah , yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  you 'd get get wide coverage .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  But I mean But you would you would You know , you 'd get good You 'd get good pick up at both ends of the table .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : qw^na^rt
C :  Well , what is what is the goal ?

dialogue type : qy^e^rt
C :  again ?

dialogue type : s
C :  We 're going to end up with some I mean , ultimately , we 're going to end up with transcriptions of these meetings .

dialogue type : qw
C :  What ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
C :  and then Then Then we 'll be done ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  huh ?

dialogue type : fg
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  Of course , there are different kinds of recos

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  so we 're going to actually train a recognizer based on these uh , far - field mikes

dialogue type : s^df
C :  cuz what we that 's the problem we 're trying to solve .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : fg|s^aap
C :  Well and also the near field will allow us to do the time alignment accurately .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Close mikes .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  yeah , I feel like that What we 're actually going to do with these data is very unclear to me

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , because I don't think that 's a That 's not going to work .

dialogue type : qy^d^f
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
C :  OK . We 're going to get horrible performance on that .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:qy
C :  Well , we know the answer to that , but unfortunately , will we get fifty percent p accuracy ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  And are they specifically far field mikes ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Well , I mean , that would be tremendously useful information

dialogue type : s^e
C :  assuming that we actually pursue it ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  but um we 've got a huge problem ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because if we ge if we want train a recognizer we need tens of hours of labelled data .

dialogue type : fh|s^ba
C :  And um it 's just eh it 's very frightening .

dialogue type : b
C :  uh - uh

dialogue type : qw^bu^rt
C :  Who , Eric ?

dialogue type : s^fe
C :  Outrageous !

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^bk|s^aap

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Yeah , that 's great .

dialogue type : s
C :  No , well , presumably there 's a an annotation standard for prefix characters or something like that .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah , exactly .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s
C :  but there it is .

dialogue type : fg|s^j

dialogue type : s^e

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
