dialogue type : s^t3
A :  Now you 're all watching me .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Alright .

dialogue type : s
A :  This way .

dialogue type : s.%
A :  You 're all watching .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  This is terrible .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  I 'll get it .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's this thing 's This is too big for my head .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
A :  No , my my But this is too big for my head .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So , I mean , it doesn't you know , it 's sit

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  No this way .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  I already tried to get it close .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  Actually if you run , though , on a close - talking mike over the whole meeting , during all those silences , you get , like , four hundred percent word error .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Or or some high number .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  Where you know who the speaker is and there 's no overlap ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^e^rt
A :  And you do just the far - field for those regions ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
A :  Right . I understand that .

dialogue type : s
A :  I just meant that so you have three choices .

dialogue type : s
A :  There 's , um You can use times where that person is talking only from the transcripts but the segmentations were were synchronized .

dialogue type : s
A :  Or you can do a forced alignment on the close - talking to determine that , the you know , within this segment , these really were the times that this person was talking

dialogue type : s
A :  and elsewhere in the segment other people are overlapping

dialogue type : s
A :  and just front - end those pieces .

dialogue type : s
A :  Or you can run it on the whole data ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  In the H L T paper we took segments that are channel time - aligned ,

dialogue type : s
A :  which is now h being changed in the transcription process ,

dialogue type : s
A :  which is good ,

dialogue type : s:s
A :  and we took cases where the transcribers said there was only one person talking here ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because no one else had time any words in that segment

dialogue type : s:s
A :  and called that " non - overlap " .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Tho - good the good numbers .

dialogue type : s
A :  The bad numbers were from the segments where there was overlap .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  Right . So we we can do that .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  It might also depend on which speaker th it is and how close they are to the PZM ?

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know how different they are from each other .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A :  f

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  So we would then use that one , too ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
A :  or ?

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
A :  Well , yeah . You could look at , I guess , that PZM or something .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  And aren't these pretty bad microphones ?

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I just remember you saying you got them to be cheap on purpose .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Cheap in terms of their quality .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : b.%
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk.%
A :  I see .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bd^no
A :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt
A :  did you wanna talk about it ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
A :  or ?

dialogue type : s
A :  I can give a I was just telling this to Jane

dialogue type : s
A :  and and W we we were able to get some definite improvement on the forced alignments by looking at them first and then realizing the kinds of errors that were occurring

dialogue type : fh
A :  and um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  some of the errors occurring very frequently are just things like the first word being moved to as early as possible in the recognition ,

dialogue type : s
A :  which is a um , I think was both a a pruning problem

dialogue type : s
A :  and possibly a problem with needing constraints on word locations .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so we tried both of these st things .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk^no
A :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I got this whacky idea that just from looking at the data , that when people talk their words are usually chunked together .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's not that they say one word and then there 's a bunch of words together .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  They 're might say one word and then another word far away if they were doing just backchannels ?

dialogue type : s
A :  But in general , if there 's , like , five or six words and one word 's far away from it , that 's probably wrong on average .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  And then also , ca the pruning , of course , was too too severe .

dialogue type : s^ng.%--
A :  Actually it was better with slightly better or about th

dialogue type : s^e^ng
A :  it was the same with tighter pruning .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's probably cuz the recognition 's just bad en at a point where it 's bad enough that that you don't lose anything .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s^arp
A :  Yeah . I mean , yeah , it isn't always true ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  and I think what we really want is some clever way to do this ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  where , um , you know , from the data or from maybe some hand - corrected alignments from transcribers that

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  those would be able to do that ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but the rest would be constrained .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , I think we have a version that 's pretty good for the native speakers .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know yet about the non - native speakers .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  we basically also made noise models for the different sort of grouped some of the mouth noises together .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , so , and then there 's a background speech model .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  There was some neat or , interesting cases ,

dialogue type : s
A :  like there 's one meeting where , um , Jose 's giving a presentation

dialogue type : s:s
A :  and he 's talking about , um , the word " mixed signal "

dialogue type : s:s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I think , Morgan .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  And so your speech - ch was s saying something about mixed signal .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the next turn was a lot of people saying " mixed " ,

dialogue type : s^e:s
A :  like " he means mixed signal " or " I think it 's mixed " .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the word " mixed " in this segment occurs , like , a bunch of times .

dialogue type : s
A :  And Chuck 's on the lapel here ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and he also says " mixed "

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  but it 's at the last one ,

dialogue type : s:s
A :  and of course the aligner th aligns it everywhere else to everybody else 's " mixed " ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  cuz there 's no adaptation yet .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So there 's I think there 's some issues about u

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
A :  We probably want to adapt at least the foreground speaker .

dialogue type : s
A :  But , I guess Andreas tried adapting both the foreground and a background generic speaker ,

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  and that 's actually a little bit of a f funky model .

dialogue type : s
A :  Like , it gives you some weird alignments ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  just because often the background speakers match better to the foreground than the foreground speaker .

dialogue type : s
A :  So there 's some things there ,

dialogue type : s^df^e
A : 

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s:s
A :  Right now the words like partial words are reject models

dialogue type : s
A :  and you normally allow those to match to any word .

dialogue type : s
A :  But then the background speech was also a reject model ,

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  you know , it needs to differentiate between the two .

dialogue type : s
A :  So just sort of working through a bunch of debugging kinds of issues .

dialogue type : s.%--:s.%--
A :  And another one is turns , like people starting with " well I think "

dialogue type : s.%--:qo.%--
A :  and someone else is " well how about " .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  So the word " well " is in this in this segment multiple times ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and as soon as it occurs usually the aligner will try to align it to the first person who says it .

dialogue type : s
A :  But then that constraint of sort of uh , proximity constraint will push it over to the person who really said it in general .

dialogue type : s
A :  Right now it 's a kluge .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I looked at them .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Oh , it was painful

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because the thing is , you know the alignments share a lot in common ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  And you 're yo you 're looking at these segments where there 's a lot of speech .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , a lot of them have a lot of words .

dialogue type : s
A :  Not by every speaker

dialogue type : s
A :  but by some speaker there 's a lot of words .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  I mean that if you look at the individual segments from just one person you don't see a lot of words ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but altogether you 'll see a lot of words up there .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  So I looked at them all in Waves

dialogue type : s
A :  and just lined up all the alignments ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and , at first it sort of looked like a mess

dialogue type : s:s
A :  and then the more I looked at it , I thought " OK , well it 's moving these words leftward

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  and " You know , it wasn't that bad .

dialogue type : s
A :  It was just doing certain things wrong .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  But , I don't , you know , have time to l to look at all of them

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  and it would be really useful to have , like , a a transcriber who could use Waves ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  and then we could , you know , do some adjustments .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  well , Jane and I were just in terms of the tool , talking about this .

dialogue type : s
A :  I guess Sue had had some reactions .

dialogue type : s
A :  You know , interface - wise if you 're looking at speech , you wanna be able to know really where the words are .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so , we can give you some examples of sort of what this output looks like ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  um , and see if you can in maybe incorporate it into the Transcriber tool some way ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s
A :  You mean like Yeah , word start insights .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah , it wou the advantage would just be that when you brought up a bin you would be able if you were zoomed in enough in Transcriber to see all the words ,

dialogue type : s
A :  you would be able to , like , have the words sort of located in time ,

dialogue type : s
A :  if you wanted to do that .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : b.%
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  So we we only r hav I only looked at actually alignments from one meeting that we chose ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  I think MR four ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  It had sort of average recognition performance in a bunch of speakers

dialogue type : s
A :  and it was a Meeting Recorder meeting .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s
A :  But , yeah , we should try to use what you have .

dialogue type : s
A :  I did re - run recognition on your new version of MR one .

dialogue type : s
A :  I I mean the the one with Dan Ellis in it and Eric .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
A :  Yeah , actually it wasn't the new new ,

dialogue type : s
A :  it was the medium new .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  But but we would we should do the the latest version .

dialogue type : s
A :  It was the one from last week .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  Don Don has had He knows he can just read it like a play .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  " And then she said , and then he said . "

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Well , that 's interesting .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^ba
A :  No , that 's really interesting .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  That 's interesting .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , but it 's interesting

dialogue type : s^df.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^ng:s
A :  But there are fewer I think there are fewer " uh - huhs " .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , just from We were looking at word frequency lists to try to find the cases that we would allow to have the reject words in between in doing the alignment .

dialogue type : s
A :  You know the ones we wouldn't constrain to be next to the other words .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  And " uh - huh " is not as frequent

dialogue type : s
A :  as it sort of would be in Switchboard ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  if you looked at just a word frequency list of one - word short utterances .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  And " yeah " is way up there ,

dialogue type : s:s
A :  but not " uh - huh " .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  And so I was thinking

dialogue type : s
A :  thi it 's not like you 're being encouraged by everybody else to keep talking in the meeting .

dialogue type : s
A :  And uh , that 's all , I I 'll stop there ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  cuz I I think what you say makes a lot of sense .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  There 's just probably less backchannelling in general ,

dialogue type : s
A :  even if you consider every other person altogether one person in the meeting ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but we 'll find out anyway .

dialogue type : s
A :  We were I guess the other thing we 're we 're I should say is that we 're gonna , um try compare this type of overlap analysis to Switchboard ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  and CallHome ,

dialogue type : qrr
A :  where we have both sides , so that we can try to answer this question of , you know , is there really more overlap in meetings or is it just because we don't have the other channel in Switchboard

dialogue type : s
A :  and we don't know what people are doing .

dialogue type : s
A :  Try to create a paper out of that .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  Um , you mean the one due tomorrow ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  Yeah . Well , we 're still , like , writing the scripts for doing the research ,

dialogue type : s^na
A :  and we will Yes , we 're gonna try .

dialogue type : s
A :  And I was telling Don , do not take this as an example of how people should work .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  So , we will try .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 'll probably be a little late ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but I 'm gonna try it .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  Well , I 'm no We may be in the same position ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and I figured we 'll try ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  It it 's not very fancy .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's just a ASCII line by line format ,

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s:s
A :  It Yeah , we 're calling these " spurts " after Chafe .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I was trying to find what 's a word for a continuous region with pauses around it ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  They do ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh !

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  I would jus

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Ah , right !

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's just , like , defined by the acoustics .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , that 's what we were calling spurt ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , well , Chafe had this wor I think it was Chafe , or somebody had a the word " spurt " originally ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  But tha that 's good to know .

dialogue type : qy
A :  Was thi it 's Chafe ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  Maybe it was Sue ?

dialogue type : %-
A :  Y

dialogue type : s
A :  So we have spurts and we have spurt - ify dot shell and spurt - ify

dialogue type : s
A :  And then it 's got all it 's a verb now .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes . Right .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
A :  It looks like a Waves label file almost . Right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  so whether it was , like , question mark or period or , um , you know , comma and things like that ,

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s^bsc
A :  sp overlaps ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , I mean , I think that 's actually really u useful also

dialogue type : qo^df
A :  because even if you weren't studying overlaps , if you wanna get a transcription for the far - field mikes , how are you gonna know which words from which speakers occurred at which times relative to each other ?

dialogue type : s
A :  You have to be able to get a transcript like like this anyway , just for doing far - field recognition .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I thi it 's just an issue we haven't dealt with before ,

dialogue type : s^e.x
A :  how you time - align things that are overlapping anyway .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , i I never thought about it before ,

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  But you can't get it directly from the transcription .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  Yeah , this is like a poor man 's ver formatting version .

dialogue type : s
A :  But it 's , you know It 's clean ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  it 's just not fancy .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Just sort of huge .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa.x|s
A :  Yeah . It 's it 's nice to know ,

dialogue type : s.x
A :  and also I think as a human , like , I don't always hear these in the actual order that they occur .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I can have two foreground speakers ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  you know , Morgan an and um , Adam and Jane could all be talking ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and I could align each of them to be starting their utterance at the correct time ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and then look where they are relative to each other ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and that 's not really what I heard .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Cuz it 's just hard to do .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Y Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
A :  Yeah , you sort of move things around until you get to a low information point

dialogue type : s
A :  and yo then you can bring in the other person .

dialogue type : s
A :  So it 's actually not even possible , I think , for any person to listen to a mixed signal ,

dialogue type : s
A :  even equalize , and make sure that they have all the words in the right order .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , I guess , we 'll try to write this Eurospeech paper .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , we will write it .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  Whether they accept it late or not , I don't know .

dialogue type : s
A :  Um , and the good thing is that we have It 's sort of a beginning of what Don can use to link the prosodic features from each file to each other .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  i You know , might as well .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  We - I ju Otherwise we won't get the work done on our deadline .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2

dialogue type : s^df^ng

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  And w we should get the two meetings from y

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , I know about the first meeting ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but the other one that you did ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  the NSA one ,

dialogue type : s
A :  which we hadn't done cuz we weren't running recognition on it ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df^e
A :  there were five non - native speakers .

dialogue type : s
A :  But , it would be useful for the to see what we get with that one .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
A :  Yeah , three .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  N S A three , I think .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know what they said

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but I know the number .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  They are hard to understand .

dialogue type : s^e^na
A :  They 're very , uh , out there .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I have no idea what they 're talking about .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  It 's the person 's fault .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  It 's Morgan 's fault .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Tha - There are some cases like where the the wrong speaker uh , these ca Not a lot , but where the the wrong person the the speech is addre attached to the wrong speaker

dialogue type : s
A :  and you can tell that when you run it .

dialogue type : s
