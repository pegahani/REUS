dialogue type : z
A :  OK .

dialogue type : z
A :  OK .

dialogue type : z
A :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Oh !

dialogue type : z
A :  Well maybe it 's just , you know , how many t u u u u how many times you crash in a day .

dialogue type : z
A :  First time first time in the day ,

dialogue type : z
A :  you know .

dialogue type : z
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
A :  That 's that 's great .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Uh .

dialogue type : qy^t^tc
A :  Do we have an agenda ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Liz Liz and Andreas can't sh can't uh , can't come .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , they won't be here .

dialogue type : h|s^na
A :  Uh , right , so so I I was just gonna talk briefly about the NSF ITR .

dialogue type : h
A :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  I mean , I won't say much ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
A :  but uh , but then , uh , you said wanna talk about digits ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  Well if we Yeah , we shouldn't add things in just to add things in .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I 'm actually pretty busy today ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  a short meeting would be fine .

dialogue type : s
A :  But there 's often things where people do false starts .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
A : 

dialogue type : fg|qy^bu^d^rt
A :  Yeah , it 's five or six times out of thousands ?

dialogue type : qh^bk
A :  Four thousand ?

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
A :  Yeah , I would , uh , tak do the easy way ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba.%-
A : 

dialogue type : qh
A :  I mean , wh who knows what studies people will be doing on on speaker - dependent things

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  the speakers who we had is is at least interesting .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that 's a couple hours of of , uh , speech , probably .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Which is a yeah reasonable reasonable test set .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  And the decision here , uh , was to continue with uh the words rather than the the numerics .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Or neither .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  But it 's just two thing ways that you can say it .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  that 's the only thought I have

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A :  because if you t start talking about these , you know u tr

dialogue type : s
A :  She 's trying to get at natural groupings ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but it there 's there 's nothing natural about reading numbers this way .

dialogue type : s^df^e
A :  I mean if you saw a telephone number you would never see it this way .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na|s^ba
A :  She 's right . It 's it it 's a different problem .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , we 've done stuff with numbers before ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  If you say s " three nine eight one " sometimes people will say " thirty - nine eighty - one "

dialogue type : s
A :  or " three hundred three hundred eighty - nine one " ,

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  or I don't think they 'd say that ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A :  but th

dialogue type : s^aa
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , th thirty - eight ninety - one is probably how they 'd do it .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  OK . Well , we 're probably gonna be collecting meetings for a while

dialogue type : s
A :  and if we decide we still wanna do some digits later we might be able to do some different ver different versions ,

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  but this is the next suggestion ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s^t^tc
A :  OK , so uh e l I guess , let me , uh , get my my short thing out about the NSF .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  actually this is maybe a little side thing .

dialogue type : s
A :  Um , I I sent to what I thought we had , uh , in some previous mail , as the right joint thing to send to ,

dialogue type : s
A :  which was " M MTG RCDR hyphen joint " .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^df
A :  No no , th I got I got , uh , little excited notes from Mari and Jeff and so on ,

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
A : 

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  you are on that list ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  So you got the note ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah ? OK .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so this was , uh , a , uh , proposal that we put in

dialogue type : s^e
A :  before on on more more higher level , uh , issues in meetings ,

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  from I guess higher level from my point of view .

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , and , uh , meeting mappings ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  so is i for it was a proposal for the ITR program ,

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , Information Technology Research program 's part of National Science Foundation .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's the second year of their doing , uh , these grants .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  some of them anyway , are larger larger grants than the usual , small NSF grants ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  and .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  So , they 're very competitive ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and they have a first phase where you put in pre - proposals ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and we we , uh , got through that .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so th the the next phase will be we 'll actually be doing a larger proposal .

dialogue type : s
A :  And I 'm I I hope to be doing very little of it .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , which was also true for the pre - proposal ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , there 'll be bunch of people working on it .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , I think April ninth , or something .

dialogue type : s
A :  So it 's about a month .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Tomorrow .

dialogue type : s
A :  March second , I said .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
A :  So that 's amazing you showed up at this meeting !

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  My favorite is was when when when one reviewer says , uh , " you know , this should be far more detailed " ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and the nex the next reviewer says , " you know , there 's way too much detail " .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  We 'll see .

dialogue type : s^am
A :  Maybe there 'll be something useful .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Do you know anything about the numbers ?

dialogue type : %-
A :  I

dialogue type : s
A :  I should go back and look .

dialogue type : s
A :  I didn't I don't think that 's true .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well we 'll have to see what the numbers are .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  But they they have to weed out enough so that they have enough reviewers .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , uh , you know , maybe they didn't r weed out as much as usual ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah . It 's it 's certainly not I 'm sure that it 's not down to one in two or something

dialogue type : s^e
A :  of what 's left .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  They have three size grants .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  This one there 's ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  See the small ones are less than five hundred thousand total over three years

dialogue type : s
A :  and that they have a fair number of them .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  and the large ones are ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^no
A :  boy , I forget ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I think , more than ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  more than a million and a half , more than two million or something like that .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  middle category .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I think we 're ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh , uh ,

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I forget what it was .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^no
A :  Uh , I don't remember ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  but it 's pr probably along the li

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  I I could be wrong on this

dialogue type : s
A :  yeah , but probably along the lines of fifteen or that they 'll fund , or twenty .

dialogue type : qy
A :  I mean when they Do you do you know how many they funded when they f in in Chuck 's ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  that he got last year ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean last time I think they just had two categories ,

dialogue type : s
A :  small and big ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and this time they came up with a middle one ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so it 'll there 'll be more of them that they fund than of the big .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh .

dialogue type : %-
A :  You know , it i

dialogue type : s^j
A :  None of it will go for those yachts that we 've talking about .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um , well ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  no , I mean it 's u

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aap
A :  It 's extending the research ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s^df.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  with the more acoustically - oriented things are are are are lower level .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And ,

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  of mapping the conversations

dialogue type : s^e
A :  to different kind of planes .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So . Um . But , um .

dialogue type : s
A :  So it 's all it 's all stuff that none none of us are doing right now ,

dialogue type : s
A :  or none of us are funded for ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so it 's so it 's it would be new .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  Well there 's evenings , and there 's weekends ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  and Uh .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.x
A :  Yeah , there there would be there would be new hires ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and and there there would be expansion ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  but ,

dialogue type : s
A :  also , there 's always for everybody there 's there 's always things that are dropping off ,

dialogue type : s
A :  grants that are ending ,

dialogue type : s
A :  or other things that are ending ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so ,

dialogue type : s
A :  there 's there 's a continual need to to bring in new things .

dialogue type : s
A :  But but there definitely would be new new new , uh , students ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and so forth , both at at UW and here .

dialogue type : h|s^no
A :  Um , not clear yet .

dialogue type : s^r
A :  Not clear yet .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  yeah , two of them are two in the c There 're two in the class already here ,

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  and and , uh uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  then there 's a third who 's doing a project here ,

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  who , uh But he he he won't be in the country that long ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  and ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  maybe another will end up .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  Actually there is one other guy who 's looking that that 's that

dialogue type : %--
A :  guy , uh ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  Jeremy ? I think .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Anyway , yeah that 's that 's all I was gonna say is that that that 's you know , that 's nice

dialogue type : s
A :  and we 're sorta preceding to the next step ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and , it 'll mean some more work , uh , you know , in in March in getting the proposal out ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and then , it 's , uh , you know We 'll see what happens .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt^t^tc
A :  Uh , the last one was that you had there , was about naming ?

dialogue type : fh|qw^t^tc
A :  Um , since we have such a short agenda list I guess I wi I will ask how how are the transcriptions going ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'm a little confused .

dialogue type : s
A :  I thought that that one of the reason we thought we were so much faster than than , uh , the the other transcription , uh , thing was that that we were using the mixed file .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Sure .

dialogue type : fg|s^ba^t^tc
A :  Uh , well I think it 's a short meeting .

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , you 're you 're you 're still in the midst of what you 're doing from what you described last time , I assume ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah , I 'd like to talk with you about it .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  some someone else besides us that you might want to talk to , uh , might be Stephane .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^2
A :  Yeah and and Thilo ,

dialogue type : b
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : fg|%-
A :  Yeah , that 's wh

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah . I 'd hafta look at that and think about it .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  It 's it 's it 's I haven't worked with that either

dialogue type : s^no
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  The way the simple - minded way I suggested was what Chuck was just saying , is that you could make a a sieve .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Let 's let 's hypothesize that it 's this frequency or that frequency ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  and and , uh ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  maybe you maybe you could use some other cute methods to , uh , short cut it by by uh , making some guesses ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  but but uh uh uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I mean you could make some guesses from , uh from the auto - correlation or something

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  but but then , given those guesses , try ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  um , uh ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  only looking at the energy at multiples of the of that frequency ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  take the one that 's maximum .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
A :  Of all the harmonics of that . Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^br^m^rt
A :  No .

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
A :  To get the pitch , yes .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  This is for ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h
A :  Uh , well ,

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba
A :  yeah that 'd be good .

dialogue type : s^arp^df
A : 

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  but I don't need you know if you need to get rid of it .

dialogue type : s^ba^bd
A :  I mean that 'd that 'd be nice

dialogue type : s^no
A :  but I don't know if it 's ess if it 's essential .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qw^t1
A :  wha what are you doing this for ?

dialogue type : s
A :  You 're trying distinguish between the case where there is , uh where where there are more than uh , where there 's more than one speaker

dialogue type : s
A :  and the case where there 's only one speaker .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So if there 's more than one speaker ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^am.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  yeah you 're so you 're not distinguished between voiced and unvoiced ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  See , if you also wanna just determine if you also wanna determine whether it 's unvoiced , then I think you want to look look at high frequencies also ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because the f the fact that there 's more energy in the high frequencies is gonna be an ob sort of obvious cue that it 's unvoiced .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  But , i i uh I mean i i

dialogue type : fh
A :  but , um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  other than that I guess as far as the one person versus two persons , it would be primarily a low frequency phenomenon .

dialogue type : s
A :  And if you looked at the low frequencies , yes the higher frequencies are gonna there 's gonna be a spectral slope .

dialogue type : s
A :  The higher frequencies will be lower energy .

dialogue type : qh
A :  But so what .

dialogue type : %-
A :  I mean that 's that 's w

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  Well , but yeah I don't think you can I mean you 're not gonna be able to look at every frame ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I I mean I I really I I really thought that the best way to do it ,

dialogue type : s^bd^df
A :  and I 'm speaking with no experience on this particular point ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  but , my impression was that the best way to do it was however you You 've used instantaneous frequency , whatever . However you 've come up you with your candidates , you wanna see how much of the energy is in that

dialogue type : s
A :  as coppo as opposed to all of the all the total energy .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  And , um , if it 's voiced ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I guess so so y I think maybe you do need a voiced - unvoiced determination too .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  But if it 's voiced ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  e the fraction of the energy that 's in the harmonic sequence that you 're looking at is relatively low , then it should be then it 's more likely to be an overlap .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^co
A :  Let 's take a second with this .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh , uh ,

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  you 're looking at f at the phase derivative ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  um ,

dialogue type : %--
A :  in in , uh ,

dialogue type : qw
A :  what domain ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  I mean this is this is in in in in bands ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  And you just take the instantaneous frequency ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Oh !

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  But the instantaneous frequency ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  wouldn't that give you something more like the central frequency of the you know , of the where most of the energy is ?

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qw
A :  Does i does it Why would it correspond to pitch ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
A : 

dialogue type : s^bu^e
A :  It 's a kinda normalization .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : b
A :  Huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  OK , yeah well I I guess I 'm not following it enough .

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'll probably gonna hafta look at the paper ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but which I 'm not gonna have time to do in the next few days ,

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  but but I 'm I 'm curious about it .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um , uh ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  I don't know think it 'd be ideal .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  We - See , we 're we 're dealing with real speech

dialogue type : s^df
A :  and we 're trying to have it be as real as possible

dialogue type : s^df^e
A :  and breaths are part of real speech .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  It is but it is if you record it .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|%-
A : 

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah i Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  If if it gets in the way of what somebody is doing with it then you might wanna have some method which will allow you to block it ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but you it 's real data .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  If s you know , if there 's a little bit of noise out there , and somebody is is talking about something they 're doing , that 's part of what we accept as part of a real meeting ,

dialogue type : %--
A :  even And

dialogue type : s
A :  we have the f uh the uh the the fan and the in the projector up there ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and , uh , this is it 's this is actual stuff that we we wanna work with .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : qh
A :  what if you put it in but didn't put the boundaries ?

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  So you just know it 's between these other things ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah I mean I 'm think if it 's too if it 's too hard for us to annotate the breaths per se , we are gonna be building up models for these things

dialogue type : s
A :  and these things are somewhat self - aligning ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so if so , we i i if we say there is some kind of a thing which we call a " breath " or a " breath - in " or " breath - out " , the models will learn that sort of thing .

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , so but you but you do want them to point them at some region where where the breaths really are .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fg|%-
A :  Yeah , i

dialogue type : s
A :  You know there is there 's this dynamic tension between between marking absolutely everything , as you know ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  and and and

dialogue type : s
A :  marking just a little bit and counting on the statistical methods .

dialogue type : s
A :  Basically the more we can mark the better .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  But if there seems to be a lot of effort for a small amount of reward in some area ,

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Cuz they 've - they 've got lots of experience with the breaths in in , uh , uh , their transcripts .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
A :  Well , yes they do ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but we we can handle that without them here .

dialogue type : fh
A :  But but but , uh ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^na
A :  That sounds like a reasonable reasonable compromise .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  u I I wanted to comment a little more just for clarification about this business about the different purposes .

dialogue type : s
A :  See , in a in a way this is a really key point ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  that for speech recognition , uh , research ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh , um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  e a it 's not just a minor part .

dialogue type : s
A :  In fact , the I think I would say the core thing that we 're trying to do is to recognize the actual , meaningful components in the midst of other things that are not meaningful .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  it 's not just incidental

dialogue type : s
A :  it 's critical for us to get these other components that are not meaningful .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Because that 's what we 're trying to pull the other out of .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's our problem .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  if if we only had changes in the spectrum that were associated with words , with different spectral components ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  and , uh , we we didn't have noise ,

dialogue type : s
A :  we didn't have convolutional errors ,

dialogue type : s
A :  we didn't have extraneous , uh , behaviors , and so forth ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and moving your head

dialogue type : s
A :  and all these sorts of things ,

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  then , actually speech recognition i i isn't that bad right now .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I mean you can

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  you know it 's it 's the technology 's come along pretty well .

dialogue type : s
A :  The the the reason we still complain about it is because is when when you have more realistic conditions then then things fall apart .

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  But that 's a research question ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  you know ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  And we don't either .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  right now it 's just raw d it 's just data that we 're collecting ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and so we don't wanna presuppose that people will be able to get rid of particular degradations

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because that 's actually the research that we 're trying to feed .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , you know , an and maybe maybe in five years it 'll work really well ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and and it 'll only mess - up ten percent of the time ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but then we would still want to account for that ten percent ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt^t^tc
A :  Should we do the digits ?
