dialogue type : z
A :  OK , this is one channel .

dialogue type : z
A :  Can you uh , say your name and talk into your mike one at a time ?

dialogue type : z
A :  OK .

dialogue type : z
A :  Uh , I don't think it 's on there , Jane .

dialogue type : z
A :  Uh , I still don't see you Jane .

dialogue type : z
A :  Yeah , I s

dialogue type : z
A :  No .

dialogue type : z
A :  Uh , well , the mike isn't close enough to your mouth ,

dialogue type : z
A :  so .

dialogue type : z
A :  S uh , try speaking loudly ,

dialogue type : z
A :  so ,

dialogue type : z
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : z
A :  good .

dialogue type : z
A :  Thank you .

dialogue type : z
A :  Well , we don't wanna renumber them ,

dialogue type : z
A :  cuz we 've already have like , forms filled out with the numbers on them .

dialogue type : z
A :  So , let 's keep the same numbers on them .

dialogue type : z
A :  OK , Dan , are you on ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Good .

dialogue type : z
A :  And I 'm getting lots of responses on different ones ,

dialogue type : z
A :  so I assume the various and assorted P Z Ms are on .

dialogue type : z
A :  Stuff .

dialogue type : z
A :  Yeah , this is not something you need to attend .

dialogue type : z
A :  So .

dialogue type : z
A :  Besides , I don't want anyone who has a weird accent .

dialogue type : z
A :  Right , Dan ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Well , then put it on your head .

dialogue type : z
A :  What are you doing ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Well , I m I would prefer that people wore it on their head

dialogue type : z
A :  but they were complaining about it .

dialogue type : z
A :  Because it 's not it doesn't go over the ears .

dialogue type : z
A : 

dialogue type : z
A :  Yeah but , there 's nowhere to put the pad so it 's comfortable .

dialogue type : z
A :  And it feels so good that way .

dialogue type : z
A :  So I I again would like to do some digits .

dialogue type : z
A :  Um .

dialogue type : z
A :  Sure .

dialogue type : z
A : 

dialogue type : z
A :  Well , you know , I 'm just that sort of digit - y g sorta guy .

dialogue type : z
A :  OK .

dialogue type : z
A :  So this is Adam .

dialogue type : z
A :  I doubt it .

dialogue type : z
A :  I think we 're session four by the way .

dialogue type : z
A :  Or m it might be five .

dialogue type : z
A :  I didn't bring my previous thing .

dialogue type : z
A :  Yeah , d leave the channel blank .

dialogue type : z
A :  Right .

dialogue type : z
A :  Uh , transcript number .

dialogue type : z
A :  Thanks .

dialogue type : z
A :  Should I turn off the VU meter Dan ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Do you think that makes any difference ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Why ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Are you gonna do something other than hit " quit " ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : z
A :  Should have done it before .

dialogue type : z
A :  The VU meter which tells you what the levels on the various mikes are

dialogue type : z
A :  and there was one hypothesis that perhaps that the act of recording the VU meter was one of the things that contributed to the errors .

dialogue type : z
A :  That was me ,

dialogue type : z
A : 

dialogue type : z
A :  Well , the only reason that could be is if the driver has a bug .

dialogue type : z
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Because the machine just isn't very heavily loaded .

dialogue type : z
A :  No chance of that .

dialogue type : z
A :  Just because it 's beta .

dialogue type : z
A :  Look OK ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Yeah , we usually do that .

dialogue type : z
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
A :  I mean , that 's what we 've done before .

dialogue type : z
A :  Which means we need to move this thing , and sorta decide how we 're actually going to do things .

dialogue type : z
A :  So .

dialogue type : z
A :  Right .

dialogue type : z
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : z
A :  That 'll work .

dialogue type : z
A :  That 'll work .

dialogue type : z
A :  That 's right .

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : fg
A :  so ,

dialogue type : s^rt^t
A :  topic of this meeting is I wanna talk a little bit about transcription .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , I 've looked a little bit into commercial transcription services

dialogue type : s
A :  and Jane has been working on doing transcription .

dialogue type : fh|s^t
A :  Uh , and so we wan wanna decide what we 're gonna do with that

dialogue type : s^t
A :  and then get an update on the electronics ,

dialogue type : s^cs^t
A :  and then , uh , maybe also talk a little bit about some infrastructure and tools , and so on .

dialogue type : fh|s^df
A :  Um , you know , eventually we 're probably gonna wanna distribute this thing

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  and we should decide how we 're gonna how we 're gonna handle some of these factors .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
A :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , so we 're we 're collecting a corpus

dialogue type : s
A :  and I think it 's gonna be generally useful .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , it seems like it 's not a corpus which is uh , has been done before .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so I think people will be interested in having having it ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : qw^br
A :  Excuse me ?

dialogue type : h|s^aap
A :  Well , or something .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Yeah , audio D V

dialogue type : s
A :  C Ds ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  you know .

dialogue type : s
A :  And and so how we do we distribute the transcripts ,

dialogue type : s
A :  how do we distribute the audio files ,

dialogue type : s
A :  how do we how do we just do all that infrastructure ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right ,

dialogue type : qy
A :  but but so should we do it in the same format as LDC

dialogue type : qw
A :  and what does that mean to what we 've done already ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So , uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  as it is , it 's sort of a ad - hoc combination of stuff Dan set and stuff I set up ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  which we may wanna make a little more formal .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  That 's right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I was actually thinking I wouldn't mind spending the summer up there .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  That would be kind of fun .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , and then also I have a bunch of stuff for doing this digits .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  So I have a bunch of scripts with X Waves , and some Perl scripts , and other things that make it really easy to extract out and align where the digits are .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  And if U d UW 's going to do the same thing I think it 's worth while for them to do these digits tasks as well .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  And what I 've done is pretty ad - hoc ,

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
A :  um , so we might wanna change it over to something a little more standard .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  You know , STM files , or XML , or something .

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
A :  What 's that ?

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Well they they certainly wanna collect more data .

dialogue type : s^df^rt
A :  And so they 're applying , I think I B

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
A :  Is that right ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Something like that .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
A :  Um , for some more money to do more data .

dialogue type : s
A :  So we were planning to do like thirty or forty hours worth of meetings .

dialogue type : s
A :  They wanna do an additional hundred or so hours .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , they want a very large data set .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , but of course we 're not gonna do that if we don't get money .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  And I would like that just to get a disjoint speaker set and a disjoint room .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , one of the things Morgan and I were talking about is we 're gonna get to know this room really well ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  the the acoustics of this room .

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  Including the fan .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
A :  Oh , it 's enormous .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  All the others have been on .

dialogue type : %-
A :  y Absolut

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^df^na
A :  High pitch hum .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Wow .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
A :  just get a variety .

dialogue type : s^ba^na
A :  They 're very good .

dialogue type : s
A :  Carbon monoxide poisoning ?

dialogue type : fg
A :  So

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I wish we had someone here working on adaptation

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because it would nice to be able to take that stuff and adapt it to a meeting setting .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No ,

dialogue type : s^df^nd
A :  software ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  to adapt the speech recognition .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  That 's true .

dialogue type : s^ng|qy^d^g^rt
A :  Well that 's not good , right ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Just these .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Well we can look into it .

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
A :  So we can get that just with , uh , media costs ,

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
A :  is that right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Great .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  So that would be yeah , that would be something to look into .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  Well , it 's silly to do unless we 're gonna have someone to work on it ,

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  so maybe we need to think about it a little bit .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|qh^cs
A :  OK , why don't you go ahead and do that then Eric ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Actually , that 's another thing I was thinking about is that maybe Jane should talk to Liz , to see if there are any transcription issues related to discourse that she needs to get marked .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  A meeting meeting meeting .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  Well this is the meeting about the meeting meeting meeting .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s:s
A :  you know , say " this is what we 're thinking about for our transcription " , if nothing else .

dialogue type : qy^rt^t
A :  So , well w shall we move on and talk a little bit about transcription then ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so since that 's what we 're talking about .

dialogue type : s
A :  What we 're using right now is a tool , um , from this French group , called " Transcriber "

dialogue type : s
A :  that seems to work very well .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  so it has a , uh , nice useful Tcl - TK user interface

dialogue type : fh
A :  and , uh ,

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes ,

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right , right .

dialogue type : s
A :  So we 're we 're at this point only looking for word level .

dialogue type : s
A :  So all all so what you have to do is just identify a segment of speech in time , and then write down what was said within it ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and identify the speaker .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so the things we that we know that I know I want are the text , the start and end , and the speaker .

dialogue type : s
A :  But other people are interested in for example stress marking .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  And so Jane is doing primary stress , um , stress marks as well .

dialogue type : s
A :  Um , and then things like repairs , and false starts , and , filled pauses , and all that other sort of stuff , we have to decide how much of that we wanna do .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : h
A :  Well ,

dialogue type : s^aap
A :  that 's part of the thing we 're talking about .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  So what we wanted to do was have Jane do basically one meeting 's worth ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  you know , forty minutes to an hour ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Ten times about ,

dialogue type : s
A :  is and so one of the things was to get an estimate of how long it would take ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and then also what tools we would use .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so the next decision which has to be made actually pretty soon is how are we gonna do it ?

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  R right ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so so one one option is to get linguistics grad students and undergrads to do it .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  And apparently that 's happened in the past .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  And I think that 's probably the right way to do it .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , it will require a post pass ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I mean people will have to look at it more than once to make sure that it 's been done correctly ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but I just can't imagine that we 're gonna get anything that much better from a commercial one .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the commercial ones I 'm sure will be much more expensive .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  Yeah right .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  We will just get Joy and Jane to do everything .

dialogue type : s
A :  But , you know , that 's what we 're talking about is getting some slaves who who need money

dialogue type : fh
A :  and , uh ,

dialogue type : %-
A :  duh , again o

dialogue type : s^j
A :  I meant Joy .

dialogue type : s:qy
A :  And so again , I have to say " are we recording "

dialogue type : s:s
A :  and then say , uh , Morgan has has consistently resisted telling me how much money we have .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , if it 's zero then we can't do any transcription .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I mean , I I can't imagine us doing it ourselves .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  N right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s^rt
A :  So at any rate , Jane was looking into the possibility of getting students ,

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
A :  at is that right ?

dialogue type : qy^d
A :  Talking to people about that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah , right .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  She 's already done quite a bit .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  No .

dialogue type : s
A :  We 've we 've thought about doing that

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  but the recognition quality is gonna be horrendous .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  Most of those are done by a person .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , we 've talked about it

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  We don't care about the timing of the words , just of the utterances .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  so so what what she 's done so far , is sort of more or less breath g not breath groups , sort of phrases , continuous phrases .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  And so , um , that 's nice because you you separate when you do an extract , you get a little silence on either end .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that seems to work really well .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  We could program that pretty easily ,

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
A :  couldn't we Dan ?

dialogue type : s^e^j
A :  Yeah , mis Mister TCL ?

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  But , if we tried to do automatic speaker ID .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I mean , cuz primarily the markings are at speaker change .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  Yeah , I guess the question is how much time will it really save us versus the time to write all the tools to do it .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s^df^ng
A :  We 're gonna need we 're gonna need ten to a hundred hours to train the tools , and validate the tools the do the d to to do all this anyway .

dialogue type : s
A :  I knew you were gonna do that .

dialogue type : s
A :  Just saw it coming .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  She 's she 's done about half a meeting .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  About half ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean that 's easy enough .

dialogue type : s
A :  I could do that .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No , no .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , that that 's easy enough .

dialogue type : s
A :  I could generate the segmentation and and you could do the words , and time yourself on it .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  So it that might be worth doing .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  That would at least tell us whether it 's worth spending a week or two trying to get a tool , that will compute the segmentations .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A :  That 'll s

dialogue type : s
A :  it might save ninety percent of the work though .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I 've already become pretty familiar with the format ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so

dialogue type : s
A :  it would be easy .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^g
A :  If you 'd tell me where it is , huh ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  It 's pretty cute .

dialogue type : s
A :  But at any rate .

dialogue type : fg
A :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  So so I think the guess at ten X seems to be pretty standard .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Everyone more or less everyone you talk to says about ten times for hard technical transcription .

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  Using using stone age tools .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , I looked at Cyber Transcriber

dialogue type : s^e
A :  which is a service that you send an audio file ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  they do a first - pass speech recognition .

dialogue type : s^e^rt
A :  And then they they do a clean up .

dialogue type : s
A :  But it 's gonna be horrible .

dialogue type : s
A :  They 're never gonna be able to do a meeting like this .

dialogue type : h|s
A :  Well , for Cyber Transcriber they don't quote a price .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  They want you to call and and talk .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  So for other services , um , they were about thirty dollars an hour .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  So , yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  For thirty dollars an hour for of their work .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  So so if it 's ten times it 's three hundred dollars an hour .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : fg|s^df
A :  so so my my search was pretty cursory .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  It was just a net search .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  And , uh , so it was only people who have web pages and are doing stuff through that .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Trivial .

dialogue type : s
A :  They had two speakers over the telephone .

dialogue type : h|s
A :  Um , mostly because they were doing much lower level time .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  So they were doing phone and syllable transcription , as well as , uh , word transcription .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  And so we 're w we decided early on that we were not gonna do that .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s^bs
A :  And so so what I 'm saying is that if we hire an external service I think we can expect three hundred dollars an hour .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I think that 's the ball park .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  There were several different companies that and the the range was very tight for technical documents .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Twenty - eight to thirty - two dollars an hour .

dialogue type : s
A :  They won't .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  We 'll have to mix them .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes , it is .

dialogue type : s
A :  Sev - several of them say that they 'll do meetings , and conferences , and s and so on .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  None of them specifically said that they would do speaker ID , or speaker change mark .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  They all just said transcription .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , the the way it worked is it it was scaled .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  So what they had is , if it 's an easy task it costs twenty - four dollars an hour

dialogue type : s^df
A :  and it will take maybe five or six times real time .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  And what they said is for the hardest tasks , bad acoustics , meeting settings , it 's thirty - two dollars an hour

dialogue type : s^df
A :  and it takes about ten times real time .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I think that we can count on that being about what they would do .

dialogue type : s
A :  It would probably be a little more

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because we 're gonna want them to do speaker marking .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yep ,

dialogue type : s
A :  we have to have a short meeting .

dialogue type : s^co^fe^j
A :  Stop talking !

dialogue type : s^2
A :  And clearly .

dialogue type : s^co^j
A :  Content words only .

dialogue type : fg
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  But at any rate , so we we have a ballpark on how much it would cost if we send it out .

dialogue type : s
A :  Thirty or forty .

dialogue type : s
A :  Three hundred dollars an hour .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right ,

dialogue type : s^df^na
A :  these are linguistics grad students .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
A :  Six .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , that 's why I said originally , that I couldn't imagine sending it out 's gonna be cheaper .

dialogue type : s
A :  And also we would have control of I mean , we could give them feedback .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Whereas if we do a service it 's gonna be limited amount .

dialogue type : s^df:s
A :  I mean , we can't tell them , you know , " for this meeting we really wanna mark stress

dialogue type : s.%--:s.%--
A :  and for this meeting we want "

dialogue type : s^df
A :  And and they 're not gonna provide they 're not gonna provide stress ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  they 're not gonna re provide repairs ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^am^df
A :  they they may or may not provide speaker ID .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that we would have to do our own tools to do that .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I hope it 's Jane .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is that alright ?

dialogue type : h|s^na
A :  Um , I would imagine there would be some monetary involved

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but we 'd have to talk to Morgan about it .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , I would like you to do it

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because you have a lot more experience than I do ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  but if if that 's not feasible , I will do it with you as an advisor .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  Yeah , six dollars an hour .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  More .

dialogue type : fg|qy^d^rt
A :  Um , any more on transcript we wanna talk about ?

dialogue type : h|s^na
A :  Um , the user interface only allows two .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  And so if if you 're using their interface to specify overlapping speakers you can only do two .

dialogue type : s
A :  But my script can handle any .

dialogue type : s
A :  And their save format can handle any .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  And so , um , using this the convention that Jane and I have discussed , you can have as many overlapping speakers as you want .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
A :  French .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  And they 're they 've been quite responsive .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I 've been exchanging emails on various issues .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  and they said that 's on in in the works for the next version .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , they said they wanted to do it but that the code is really very organized around single channels .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I think that 's n unlikely to ha happen .

dialogue type : qy^d
A :  For this exact task ?

dialogue type : s
A :  I think they 're linguists .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's also All the source is available .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  If you if you speak TCLTK .

dialogue type : s
A :  And they have they 've actually asked if we are willing to do any development

dialogue type : s:s^am
A :  and I said , well , maybe .

dialogue type : s
A :  So if we want if we did if we did something like programmed in a delay , which actually I think is a great idea , um , I 'm sure they would want that incorporated back in .

dialogue type : s
A :  Way .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  So I mean , tho those are things we could do

dialogue type : fh
A :  but

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I I just don't know how much it 's worth doing .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Point ,

dialogue type : s
A :  whatever .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Non - canonical .

dialogue type : qy^d
A :  Comments .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  Well , I think what w what Eric was talking about was channels other than the direct speech ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  Yeah , there 's an overlapping mark .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Well there there 's a lot of overlapping at the beginning and end .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Huge amounts .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
A :  Um , when when no one i when we 're not actually in the meeting , and we 're all sort of separated , and and doing things .

dialogue type : s
A :  But even during the meeting there 's a lot of overlap

dialogue type : s
A :  but it it 's marked pretty clearly .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  and but I think a lot of them were because you were at the meeting .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so I think that that often often you can't tell .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  I mean , Jane had had comments like uh , to who who the person was speaking to .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ng
A :  Yeah , but someone who , uh , was just the transcriber wouldn't have known that .

dialogue type : s^df:s
A :  Or when Dan said , " I wa I wasn't talking to you " .

dialogue type : s
A :  You have to turn off your mike .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Well what what it what happens is if you 're a transcriber listening to it it sounds like Dan is just being a total totally impolite .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  But but if you knew that that I wasn't actually in the room , and that Dan wasn't talking to me , it it became OK .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa^j
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa^j
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Stereo .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
A :  I should rewrite the mix tool to put half the people in one channel and half in the other .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I have a auto - gain - mixer tool that mixes all the head mounted microphones into one signal

dialogue type : s^df
A :  and that seems to work really well for the uh transcribers .

dialogue type : s
A :  I I did notice that there were some segments that had pauses on the beginning and end .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  We should probably mark areas that have no speakers as no speaker .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Then , so question mark colon is fine for that .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Just say silence .

dialogue type : s
A :  No one 's talking .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : h|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  I don't want them to be part of another utterance .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  So you just you need to have the boundary at the start and the end .

dialogue type : s
A :  It can read and write as many as you want ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  it 's just that it

dialogue type : s^bk|%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I didn't explain it well .

dialogue type : s
A :  If we use the the little the conventions that Jane has established , I have a script that will convert from that convention to their saved convention .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's just user interface .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  the the the whole saved form the saved format and the internal format , all that stuff , handles multiple speakers .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  It 's just there 's no user interface for specifying multiple any more than two .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : fg
A :  So

dialogue type : s
A :  Especially for meetings .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I mean , if i if you were just recording someone 's day , it would be impossible . You know ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  if you were trying to do a remembrance agent .

dialogue type : s
A :  But I think for meetings it 's probably alright .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  But , a lot of these issues , I think that for uh , from my point of view , where I just wanna do speech recognition and information retrieval , it doesn't really matter .

dialogue type : s
A :  But other people have other interests .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|qy^tc
A :  Well , so anyway , are we interested then in writing tools to try to generate any of this stuff automatically ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is that something you want to do , Dan ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
A :  No .

dialogue type : s
A :  But I think for a first try that 's about right .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : qy
A :  Are we gonna run out of disk space by the way ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  good .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  Dan 's sort of already started .

dialogue type : qy^j^rt
A :  Can we sell banner ads ?

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  What a good idea ,

dialogue type : s^j
A :  that 's how we could pay for the transcription .

dialogue type : fg|qw
A :  Hey , what about me ?

dialogue type : s^na
A :  We can do it all .

dialogue type : s
A :  And we have we have quite a disparate number of web and other sorts of documents on this project sort of spread around .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  I have several

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and Dan has a few ,

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Try try to s consolidate .

dialogue type : qh^df
A :  I mean , who wants to do that though ?

dialogue type : s^df
A :  No one wants to do that .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^nd
A :  Yeah , I own the project

dialogue type : s
A :  but I don't wanna do it .

dialogue type : s^fe^j
A :  It 's mine !

dialogue type : s^fe^j
A :  All mine !

dialogue type : %
A :  " Wah - hah - hah - hah - hah - hah . "

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , I I 'm talking about putting together all the data in a form that that is legible , and pleasant to read , and up to date , and et cetera , et cetera , et cetera .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  It 's it 's absolutely against the law to use a tool .

dialogue type : s
A :  I haven't found any tools that I like .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's just as easy to use to edit the raw HTML as anything else .

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  It 's obviously not true .

dialogue type : s
A :  Now , I guess if I were if I were doing more powerful excuse me more complex web sites I might want to .

dialogue type : fh
A :  But

dialogue type : s
A :  most of the web sites I do aren't that complex .

dialogue type : fh
A :  But .

dialogue type : s
A :  I think both .

dialogue type : s
A :  Mostly in house .

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : fg
A :  well ,

dialogue type : s^co
A :  send me links

dialogue type : %--
A :  and I wi

dialogue type : s^bsc^co
A :  send me pointers , rather ,

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  and I 'll put it together .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh|s^co^t^tc
A :  um , let 's move on to electronics .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Yeah , does everyone know about the lip on the table ?

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  It 's great .

dialogue type : %
A :  Clink !

dialogue type : %
A :  Clink !

dialogue type : s^2.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  He is .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : s^co^fe^j
A :  Get your paper off my PDA !

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Well , we wanna do that definitely .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Sleeve .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  OK , not just sleeve them all ?

dialogue type : qy^d
A :  And leave them loose ?

dialogue type : s^fe
A :  Whoo !

dialogue type : s^bk.%-
A :  Speed

dialogue type : s
A :  A " sleeping policeman " !

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Cool .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  That 's really cruel .

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  So why do we have sixteen channels instead of like some fewer number ?

dialogue type : h|s^bk
A :  Well , OK ,

dialogue type : s^co
A :  let me rephrase that .

dialogue type : qw
A :  Why two each ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Alright .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  But then none of these .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  N none of these and no P Z Ms then .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , I see ,

dialogue type : s^bk^r
A :  I see .

dialogue type : fg|qy^d
A :  So so you 'd imagine some sort of in some sort of patch panel on top to figure out what the mapping was between each d of these two and each of those one or what ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  Oh , then it comes on .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see , I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  good .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
A :  You g

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  And did it work ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Did it sound good ?

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Wow .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  So what 's the schedule on these things ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  So I think the other thing I 'd like to do is , do something about the set up

dialogue type : s^df
A :  so that it 's a little more presentable and organized .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  And I 'm I 'm just not sure what that is .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  I mean , some sort of cabinet .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
A :  Yeah , I understand .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^j|qy^d^f^g
A :  I need a desk at home too , alright ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is that gonna be a better solution than just going out and buy one ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  And it 's total crap .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right ,

dialogue type : s
A :  Kleenex and telephones .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  so yeah , I g I guess it 's just a question , is that something you wanna spend your time on ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
A :  OK , great .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Lax .

dialogue type : s^cc^j
A :  I 'm telling you , I 'm just gonna cart one of them away if they stay there much longer .

dialogue type : fg
A :  So , um ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  j uh ,

dialogue type : s^t
A :  then the other question is do we wanna try to do a user interface that 's available out here ?

dialogue type : s
A :  A user interface .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  I mean , do we wanna try to get a monitor ?

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Or just something .

dialogue type : qw
A :  And how do we want to do that ?

dialogue type : s^aap
A :  J just so we see something .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I have an IRAM machine I 've borrowed and we can use it .

dialogue type : fg|qrr
A :  Wait , isn't that an ethernet connection or is that a phone ?

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A :  We jus

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bs
A :  right , so it 's just a question of getting a laptop and a wireless modem .

dialogue type : s
A :  To Mac .

dialogue type : s
A :  Airport .

dialogue type : s
A :  The question is , is there an Apple driver ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  I 've I 've borrowed the IRAM VAIO Sony thingy ,

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  and I don't think they 're ever gonna want it back .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  But that does mean so we can use that as well .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I had actually earlier asked if I could borrow one of the cards to do wireless stuff

dialogue type : s:s^aa
A :  and they said , " sure ,

dialogue type : s:s^na
A :  whenever you want " .

dialogue type : fh|s^ba
A :  So I think it won't be a problem .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  PC card .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Right , I mean , and if and if his doesn't work , as I said , we can use the PC .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Good .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  So Jim is gonna be doing wiring and you 're gonna give some thought to cabinets ?

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Great .

dialogue type : s^fe
A :  They 're flashing !

dialogue type : s
A :  When people talk , it they go on and off .

dialogue type : s
A :  Cheap .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  A PC and a peanuts .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Good .

dialogue type : s^nd.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  There 's a speech compression program that works great on things like this ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  cuz if the dynamic range is low it encodes it with fewer bits .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  And so most of the time no one 's talking

dialogue type : s^e
A :  so it shortens it dramatically .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  But if you talk quieter , the dynamic range is lower and it will compress better .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^am
A :  Probably .

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  Shorter words .

dialogue type : qw:fh
A :  How about if you just go " uh " ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  How do you spell that ?

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : qy^rt^t
A :  can you do one more round of digits ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Are we done talking ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Do we have more to talk about ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Are you done ?

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'm done .

dialogue type : s^cc^j
A :  I 'll I 'll remember to bring M and M 's next time .

dialogue type : z
A :  It 's harder at the end than at the beginning .

dialogue type : z
A : 

dialogue type : z
A :  It 's it 's only a hard time for the transcriber not for the speech recognizer .

dialogue type : z
A :  Me .

dialogue type : z
A :  Ugh !

dialogue type : z
A :  I didn't know that .

dialogue type : z
A :  I should have randomized it .

dialogue type : z
A : 

dialogue type : z
A :  Right .

dialogue type : z
A : 

dialogue type : z
A :  we don't have to transcribe .

dialogue type : z
A :  We don't have to tran

dialogue type : z
A :  Yeah , please .

dialogue type : z
A :  Bet we could do it .

dialogue type : z
A :  Actually , this I got this directly from another training set , from Aurora .

dialogue type : z
A :  So .

dialogue type : z
A :  We can compare directly .

dialogue type : z
A :  What ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Great .

dialogue type : z
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : z
A :  the mike 's off .

dialogue type : z
A :  Thank you all .
