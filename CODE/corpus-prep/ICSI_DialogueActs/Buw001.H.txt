H :  What

dialogue type : s
H :  Otherwise you just get a heartbeats .

dialogue type : %--
H : 

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  Well , one thing that came up in the morning in the morning was the , um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  if he has s

dialogue type : s^df^no
H :  I I don't remember ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
H :  Mister Lan - Doctor Landry ?

dialogue type : s^bu^m^rt
H :  La - Landay ?

dialogue type : s
H :  So he has , um , these , uh , um , tsk note - taking things ,

dialogue type : s
H :  then that would sort of be a summary which you wouldn't have to solicit .

dialogue type : s
H :  y if if we were able to to do that .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
H :  The roll call .

dialogue type : s
H :  I 'm Jane Edwards , I think on channel B .

dialogue type : qy
H :  Should we have used pseudo - names ?

dialogue type : qy.%--
H :  Should we do it a second time with pseudo

dialogue type : s^ar
H :  No . No .

dialogue type : s
H :  Next nearest .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK .

dialogue type : s
H :  I have a question on protocol in these meetings ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
H :  which is when you say " Jimlet " and the person listening won't know what that is , sh shou How how do we get Is that important information ?

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s^df^e.%--
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  Good .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK . Good .

dialogue type : fg|s^t^tc
H :  OK , so we were on the data collection and the summary issue .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %
H :  Tsk .

dialogue type : s^df^ng
H :  Well , there is this other thing which y which you were alluding to earlier , which is , um , there are certain key words like , you know , " action item " and things like that ,

dialogue type : s^e
H :  which could be used in , uh , t to some degree finding the structure .

dialogue type : s
H :  And and I also , um , was thinking , with reference to the n uh , note - taking ,

dialogue type : s
H :  the advantage there is that you get structure without the person having to do something artificial later .

dialogue type : s
H :  And the fir third thing I wanted to say is the summaries afterwards ,

dialogue type : s
H :  um , I think they should be recorded instead of written

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because I think that , um , it would take so long for people to write that I think you wouldn't get as good a summary .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba
H :  Yeah , good .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  Good point .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  That 's a nice idea .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  y So if th if the obscure item you want to know more about was some form of data collection ,

dialogue type : s:s
H :  you know , maybe the summary would say , you know , " we discussed types of na data collection " .

dialogue type : s
H :  And , you know And and maybe you could get to it by that .

dialogue type : s
H :  If you if you had the the larger structure of the of the discourse , then if you can categorize what it is that you 're looking for with reference to those l those larger headings , then you can find it

dialogue type : s^e
H :  even if you don't have a direct route to that .

dialogue type : s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^df^rt
H :  I I I think that , um , there 's we 're using " summary " in two different ways .

dialogue type : s
H :  So what you just described I would describe as " minutes " .

dialogue type : s.%--:qw
H :  And what I originally thought was , um , if you asked someone " what was the meeting about ? "

dialogue type : s^e:s
H :  And then they would say " well , we talked about this

dialogue type : s^e:s
H :  and then we talked about that ,

dialogue type : s^e:s
H :  and so - and - so talked about "

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  I e My thought was to have multiple people summarize it , on recording rather than writing

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because writing takes time

dialogue type : s^e.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  Whereas if you just say it immediately after the meeting ,

dialogue type : s
H :  you know , a two - minute summary of what the meeting was about , I think you would get ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
H :  uh , with mult

dialogue type : s
H :  See , I I also worry about having a single note - taker

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because that 's just one person 's perception .

dialogue type : fh
H :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s^df^e
H :  you know , it it 's releva it 's relative to what you 're focus was on that meeting ,

dialogue type : s^df^e
H :  and and people have different major topics that they 're interested in .

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  So , my proposal would be that it may be worth considering both of those types , you know , the note - taking and a spontaneous oral summary afterwards ,

dialogue type : s
H :  no longer than two minutes ,

dialogue type : s^e
H :  from multiple people .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
H :  I agree .

dialogue type : s^na
H :  I agree .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  That 's wonderful .

dialogue type : s^na
H :  I agree .

dialogue type : b.%
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  It 's just a digital record .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
H :  Yes , I agree .

dialogue type : s^na
H :  I agree .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  It 's i because discourse is about things ,

dialogue type : s^df^e
H :  and then you have the things that are about , and it 's recoverable .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^na
H :  And it 's so simple .

dialogue type : s^df^e
H :  Like you said , three snapshots

dialogue type : fh
H : 

dialogue type : s^e
H :  Just to archive .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na

dialogue type : s|s^aa
H :  Well , there 's that 'd be the the parallel , yeah .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
H :  But I think y she 's we 're just proposing a minimal preservation of things on boards ,

dialogue type : s^e
H : 

dialogue type : s^cs

dialogue type : s.%--

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
H :  Well , it 's worth considering .

dialogue type : s^cs

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^aa

H : 

dialogue type : s^na

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
H :  Yeah , I 'd just try Well , however the least intrusive and and quickest way is ,

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  and th and closest to the meeting time too ,

dialogue type : s^df
H :  cuz people will start to forget it as soon as they l leave .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
H :  w

dialogue type : s.%-
H :  I would s

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qh^cs
H :  And I 'm also wondering , couldn't that be included in the data sample

dialogue type : s^df
H :  so that you could increase the num you know , the words that are , uh , recognized by a particular individual ?

dialogue type : s^df^e.%--
H :  If you could include the person 's meeting stuff and also the person 's summary stuff , maybe that would be uh ,

dialogue type : s^e
H :  an ad addition to their database .

dialogue type : s^e
H :  Under the same acoustic circumstance ,

dialogue type : s^df
H :  cuz if they just walk next door with their set - up , nothing 's changed ,

dialogue type : %--
H : 

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  Uh , let the record show the light is flickering .

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  I 'm also wondering if we could ask the the people a a question

dialogue type : s^cs^e:qw
H :  which would be " what was the most interesting thing you got out of this meeting ? "

dialogue type : s^df
H :  Becau - in terms of like informativeness ,

dialogue type : s^df
H :  it might be , you know , that the summary would would not in even include what the person thought was the most interesting fact .

dialogue type : s^df^na
H :  I think you get two different types of information .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  Because you get , like , the general structure of important points and what the what the meeting was about .

dialogue type : s
H :  So you get the general structure , the important points of what the meeting was about with the summary .

dialogue type : qh
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  Uh , so the fact that , uh , I know that Transcriber uses Snack is something that I thought was interesting

dialogue type : s
H :  and that and that Dan worked on on that .

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s^f
H :  you know .

dialogue type : s
H :  So , I mean , you could ge pick up some of the micro items that wouldn't even occur as major headings

dialogue type : s^e
H :  but could be very informative .

dialogue type : s^df^e
H :  I think it wouldn't be too , uh , uh , cost - intensive either .

dialogue type : s
H :  You know , I mean , it 's like something someone can do pretty easily on the spur of the moment .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  some some of the little things that would be hidden .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  That would be interesting .

dialogue type : b
H :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s:s
H :  Well , and and one thing , we we 're saying " important " and we 're saying " interesting " .

dialogue type : s
H :  And and those those can be two different things .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK , good .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s:s
H :  I will say that that I I chose " interesting "

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because I think it includes also " important "

dialogue type : s^e
H :  in some cases .

dialogue type : s
H :  But , um , I I I feel like the summary gets at a different type of information .

dialogue type : s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  i it puts a lot of burden on the person to to evaluate .

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
H :  k

dialogue type : b
H :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  That 's good .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  I like that .

dialogue type : s^ba^r
H :  I like that .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
H :  A

dialogue type : s
H :  And one and one qualification on on the oral summaries .

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  They 'd be s they 'd be separate .

dialogue type : s^e
H :  They wouldn't be hearing each other 's summaries .

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  And and that would also be that the data would be included in the database .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  I I was wondering if if there might be one s more source of queries

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  which is indicator phrases like " action item " ,

dialogue type : s^e
H :  which could be obtained from the text from the transcript .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
H :  Yeah , that 's something to be determined , something to be specified ,

dialogue type : s^e
H :  but text - oriented .

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
H :  I think you 'd remember that , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
H :  Yeah , that 's true .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
H :  Well , but then you could you could prompt them to say , you know , " other than your action item " ,

dialogue type : s
H :  you know , whatever .

dialogue type : s
H :  But but the action item would be a way to get , uh , maybe an additional query .

dialogue type : fh
H :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^df
H : 

dialogue type : b.%
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yeah . yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  Good .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK .

dialogue type : %-
H :  So y

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Sure , sure , sure .

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  You could email to both of us , uh , just I mean , if you wanted to .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
H :  I mean , I don't think either of us would mind recei

dialogue type : s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^2.%--
H :  Edwards at

dialogue type : s^e
H :  ICSI .

dialogue type : fg|s
H :  Yeah , using foot pedals

dialogue type : fh
H : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
H :  Yeah . They they don't have a way .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  But they have a verification .

dialogue type : s^na
H :  I did .

dialogue type : s
H :  I I m emailed them the Transcriber URL ,

dialogue type : s^rt
H :  um , the on - line , uh , data that Adam set up ,

dialogue type : s^e
H :  The URL

dialogue type : s
H :  so they can click on an utterance and hear it .

dialogue type : s
H :  and I emailed them the str streamlined conventions

dialogue type : s
H :  which you got a copy of today .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  Good .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  Oh , excellent . Good .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  I C - I CC ' ed Morgan .

dialogue type : s^fa
H :  I should have sent I should have CC ' ed you as well .

dialogue type : s^nd
H :  Oh , I thought we did .

dialogue type : s^rt
H :  We discussed , uh , musi musical score notation

dialogue type : fh
H : 

dialogue type : s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
H :  OK , excellent .

dialogue type : s.%-
H :  Well , it c

dialogue type : b
H :  Great .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mmm .

dialogue type : qy
H :  Can I ask , uh , one thing ?

dialogue type : s
H :  It relates to data data collection

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : fh
H :  um , so ,

dialogue type : s
H :  um , I s I know that from with the near - field mikes some of the problems that come with overlapping speech , uh , are lessened .

dialogue type : qr^cs
H :  But I wonder if Uh , is that sufficient or should we consider maybe getting some data gathered in such a way that , um , u w we would c uh , p have a meeting with less overlap than would otherwise be the case ?

dialogue type : s
H :  So either by rules of participation , or whatever .

dialogue type : s
H :  Now , I mean , you know , it 's true ,

dialogue type : s
H :  I mean , we were discussing this earlier ,

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  so if you 've got someone giving a report you 're not gonna have as much overlap .

dialogue type : fh
H :  But , um ,

dialogue type : s
H :  i i uh , so we 're gonna have s you know , non - overlapping samples anyway .

dialogue type : qr
H :  But , um , in a meeting which would otherwise be highly overlapping , is the near - field mike enough or should we have some rules of participation for some of our samples to lessen the overlap ?

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK .

dialogue type : b
H :  OK .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
H :  OK , good .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
H :  On the task , and the task .

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  I just wanted to uh ,

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because you know , it is true people can modify the amount of overlap that they do if if they 're asked to .

dialogue type : s^bd
H :  Not not entirely modify it ,

dialogue type : s^df
H :  but lessen it if if it 's desired .

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  I just wanted to be sure that we will not be having a lot of data which can't be processed .

dialogue type : s
H :  Time .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
H :  Fine . And I you know , I I know that the near f near - field mikes will take care of also the problems to s to a certain degree .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  I just wanted to be sure .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  eh , so I I know that in l in legal depositions people are pr are prevented from overlapping .

dialogue type : s
H :  They 'll just say , you know you know , " wait till each person is finished before you say something " .

dialogue type : s
H :  So it is possible to lessen if we wanted to .

dialogue type : s
H :  But but these other factors are fine .

dialogue type : s
H :  I just wanted to raise the issue .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
H :  Yeah , I think that 's always desired .

dialogue type : s
H :  I just want to be sure we don't that we 're able to process , i u uh , you know , as much data as we can .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : %-
H :  u e e

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
H :  Yeah , I am .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
H :  So , I w uh , just just for clarification .

dialogue type : s
H :  So " found data " ,

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
H :  they mean like established corpora of linguistics and and other fields , right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
H :  It sounds like such a t

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK .

dialogue type : s
H :  But it includes like standard corpora that have been used for years in linguistics and other fields .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Yeah . OK , OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  That 's interesting .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
H :  Just wanted to know .

dialogue type : s
H :  Well , I I just realized there 's another category of interesting things

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  which is that , um ,

dialogue type : s
H :  I I found this discussion very , uh , i this this question of how you get at queries really interesting .

dialogue type : s
H :  And and the and I and the fact that it 's sort of , uh , nebulous , what what that what kind of query it would be

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because it depends on what your purpose is .

dialogue type : s
H :  So I actually found that whole process of of trying to think of what that would involve to be interesting .

dialogue type : s
H :  But that 's not really a specific fact .

dialogue type : s
H :  I just sort of thought we we went around a nice discussion of the factors involved there ,

dialogue type : s
H :  which I thought was worthwhile .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  That 's a good point .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Oh .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
H :  Like e expert systems and stuff ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
H :  or ?

dialogue type : b
H :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b.%
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qr.%--
H :  h Do we need do I need to turn something off here , or I do unplug this , or ?
