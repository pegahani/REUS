B :  By next Friday .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  It 's more money .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  Something like that .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  It 's

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , I mean , we 're in conjunction with uh , SRI , Washington , and , um , Columbia .

dialogue type : s
B :  And to do research on the meetings .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qo^cs^d.%--
B :  Mapping meetings , or ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  It 's like creating a m a map of a meeting , in a sense .

dialogue type : s
B :  It actually doesn't have a whole lot of m speech stuff to it .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa^m
B :  Higher level , yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't remember .

dialogue type : s.%--

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Did he ever figure out how to d switch between applications like he was wanting to do ?

dialogue type : qy^br^d^rt
B :  He did ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  How is he gonna do it ?

dialogue type : fg|%-
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%-
B :  No . He said he tried that , but he didn't like it because it ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  it took it out of the , um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  presentation mode .

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
B :  Oh !

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|qw^rt
B :  Oh , so what do you have to do ?

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  And then you can come back to your full screen version of your presenta

dialogue type : s^bk^fe^rt
B :  Oh !

dialogue type : qw
B :  How much memory does he have ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  How much memory does he have ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
B :  Wow !

dialogue type : qrr^rt
B :  So , are we the only ones who are giving demo ? Or is , uh , Washington gonna have a demo too ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh ! OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah , I see .

dialogue type : s
B :  Oh , my gosh .

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Display the features .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  So you see , like , the F - zero contour ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Oh , neat .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Was this code that you downloaded to do this ?

dialogue type : qrr.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^j
B :  At SRI dot com ?

dialogue type : s^ar|%-
B :  No , i

dialogue type : s^df
B :  It sounded like a URL , the way you were saying it ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  So what I mean is , like the implementation that you used was something that you coded up here ?

dialogue type : qrr
B :  Or you grabbed code from somewhere else ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Ah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yeah , it 's done now .

dialogue type : s
B :  She said it was much faster .

dialogue type : s
B :  It really helped a lot to have that .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
B :  So , um , you know , there were a l

dialogue type : s^2
B :  From scratch .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s
B :  No , f no . So from the point where we s take it , it 's faster .

dialogue type : s
B :  u So it 's sorta like doing things in parallel .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  You know ? So if , you know , if they can be working on that while we 're working on the other things , then when we get them in , they don't have to do that one from scratch , basically .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah , th Right now it is taking a bit of time to turn around the meetings from IBM ,

dialogue type : %-
B :  part

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's there 's several problems .

dialogue type : s
B :  One is , um , we were giving them these large files ,

dialogue type : s
B :  which they then had to split up and put onto cassette tapes .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  So either ninety minute or sixty minute tapes ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so they had to try to find an appropriate place to break this large file that we gave them .

dialogue type : s
B :  So one of the things that we did is , Adam made a modification to th his script that generates this so you can tell it that you want , uh , basically , uh , chunks that are no more than either thirty or forty - five minutes .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then we can give those to IBM

dialogue type : s
B :  and it 'll make it easier for them to put them on tape .

dialogue type : s
B :  Um , then the other thing is that these pool of transcribers that they 're using , um , sort of are not dedicated to to our project ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but are in use for all IBM projects ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  and IBM has recently giving given them uh , a whole bunch of stuff .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's gonna , sort of delay us .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
B :  Hmm , that 's an interesting idea .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah . So the only difference would be , we would be putting the stuff on tape versus IBM .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B :  And then we could send If if we had that process down , of putting the audio onto tape ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
B :  we can send IBM the tapes or we can send this transcription place the tape

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B :  Well , u u

dialogue type : s^no
B :  So , I don't know where the bottleneck was .

dialogue type : qr
B :  Was the bottleneck in breaking this large file up into the appropriate size chunks ? or was it actually putting it onto the tape ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Exactly .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|qw
B :  Yeah , so how do we do that ?

dialogue type : qw.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  So plug i So , like , the headphone output in the back of the computer ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  Line - out into the line - in on a tape player ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk^rt|s^ba
B :  Oh ! Well , that sounds pretty easy .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ng.%-
B : 

dialogue type : h|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : h
B :  OK .

dialogue type : h|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Since we started doing this new , uh , beep format with " beep number beep " ,

dialogue type : s
B :  they 've given us , uh , I think , two full , uh , transcripts .

dialogue type : s
B :  They have a third one

dialogue type : s
B :  and Brian just sent me a note saying " oh , that third one somehow slipped through the cracks of their tr of the eh transcriptionists ' , uh , s company " .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so there 's gonna be delay of a week before we get that third one back .

dialogue type : s
B :  And I 've already given him three more to work on ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but he said those new three won't get done until this big chunk of data has been processed by the company .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  Yeah . Yeah , they 're working away .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Right , right .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  well , into the the , uh , master sheet here with the statuses

dialogue type : s
B :  and I pick ones that Thilo has , um , pre - segmented ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and I change the status to " Trans - IP IBM " ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so that , you know , when Jane or whoever goes to select the next meeting they won't choose one of those .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So I 'm not picking huge chunks , right now , of meetings for them ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
B :  Mm - hmm . That 's a good idea .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Huh .

dialogue type : qr
B :  So when that thing When it stutters like that , is it because there 's a delay getting the data off a disk ? Or is it because there 's a delay in the D to A ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Maybe we could do it from a w a PC or something .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Well , you know , I I think David might have a bunch of o old P Cs ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz he 's replacing them with these new ones .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Maybe we could get one ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  and just dedicate it to doing this .

dialogue type : s^cs^e.%--
B :  Not even hook it u

dialogue type : s^bd^df
B :  Well , I guess we need to hook it to the network

dialogue type : s
B :  so we can get the files to it ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but

dialogue type : h
B :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah . Right .

dialogue type : s^2^cs
B :  And then just use that machine to hook up to the tape .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  We don't need a powerful machine to do these things ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Should talk to him about that .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's why I wanted to avoid having to do that if we could ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  They have a um a device that , you put the cassette in

dialogue type : s
B :  and it has a foot pedal that lets you go back and forth and stuff like that .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  I guess they haven't got a p

dialogue type : qh^br
B :  Really !

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Y can you send them huge audio files ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Huh !

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's interesting .

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
B :  Well , that 's true .

dialogue type : qw
B :  Are How big are these files that we send to Brian ?

dialogue type : qh^br
B :  Really ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  That big ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I thought it was , like , a hundred megs .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's still pretty dang big .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Wha - whatever you generate .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , the last ones you did were compressed .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Wonder if the ones before that were shortened .

dialogue type : s^2^df.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm !

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw
B :  What will that do ?

dialogue type : qy.%--
B :  Is that going to ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Oh ! That 'll be nice .

dialogue type : s
B :  I should be around .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Experiments ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s^am.%--
B :  Yeah , I guess that 's probably next .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Demo .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bd
B :  Oh , but that 's not specific to Meeting Recorder .

dialogue type : s
B :  I was gonna say I took some a suggestion of Adam 's ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and I , um , created a m CGI script that lets you see the current status of the speech disks .

dialogue type : s
B :  So if you go to the speech local web page , and then there 's a disk status page .

dialogue type : s
B :  You can click on that

dialogue type : s
B :  and it 'll query Abbott ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and give you a a list of all the disks that we have

dialogue type : s
B :  and then , uh , what 's on each one ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then it shows how big the disk is

dialogue type : s
B :  and what percent full it is .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  And that 's , you know , each time you go there , it 's updated .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  The new disks are installed .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  If you need space just let me know .

dialogue type : s
B :  I have to create the p appropriate sub - directory .

dialogue type : s
B :  So we 're s kinda trying to keep even the scratch ones we 're keeping a little organized , where we put a y a U doctor speech data ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then I 'll either create a sub - directory for , like if it 's Meeting Recorder project , or Hub - five or whatever .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So we c

dialogue type : s
B :  I just have to create those sub - directories ,

dialogue type : %-
B :  and

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^ar^r
B :  No .

dialogue type : %
B :  Nnn .

dialogue type : s^m^na
B :  It 's all scratch .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar^rt|s^rt
B :  No , it 's D E .

dialogue type : s
B :  D E 's not full .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  DD 's full .

dialogue type : s
B :  That was the first one .

dialogue type : s
B :  Or , that was the last one that w filled up ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  and DE still had like ,

dialogue type : s
B :  last time I looked it was like seven gigs or something .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  And each meeting is roughly half a gig ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and so .

dialogue type : s^2^m
B :  We 're getting close .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Morgan said something about stopping at the end of the year .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Like when we get around a hundred meetings .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Um , because there 's gonna be data coming from UW , hopefully by then .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba
B :  Yeah , it feels funny ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  huh ?

dialogue type : s
B :  If we have the capability .

dialogue type : qh
B :  Now that we 're used to recording , it 's like , eh , well , why not keep going ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  We have right now , like , seventy - five or seventy - six hours of meetings .

dialogue type : qy^bu^ng^rt.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Yeah , we need to figure something out ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  e e We can't add anymore disks to it .

dialogue type : s
B :  We can increase the size of the disks that are on it ,

dialogue type : s^bd
B :  but that will only take us so far .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  David had the suggestion about , you know , new servers and things like that ,

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  and so I 'm gonna see if we can talk to Morgan about getting some money for a new disk server .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Yeah , it would have to replace Abbott , basically .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , he David 's planning to get new servers anyways for all of the main servers .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think he wants to sorta go with the same type of machine for all of these .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , it 's full in there .

dialogue type : qy.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  uh , the SUN - Blade - one - hundreds ?

dialogue type : s
B :  They 're like stacked up on benches and things all over .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  It 's really crowded .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^ar^rt
B :  Oh , yeah . Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
B : 

dialogue type : h|s
B :  Oh ! I 've forgotten now .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yeah . They 're in the P - make pool .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So if you do a " reginfo minus show attribute " , and

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  A r

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah . Y

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  You can get a list of all the machines that are available to P - make , by using the command " reginfo

dialogue type : s^e
B :  minus show - ATTR " .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  And I for I 'm not sure what attributes we attach to the SUN - Blade - one - hundreds ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but it could be SB - one - hundred .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so if you query for f all machines that have that attribute , then you should see the names of the new machines .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But .

dialogue type : s^t1.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , there 's sort of .

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's this one called There 's the attribute called " no " What 's that called , uh , " n " " no " uh , " no - evict " .

dialogue type : s
B :  Which is roughly that .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's Although it 's like it h My machine has it on my desk .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , I do get jobs running on my machine all the time .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um , But , uh ,

dialogue type : s^t^tc
B :  So so that 's that 's sort of what it is .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Sure .
