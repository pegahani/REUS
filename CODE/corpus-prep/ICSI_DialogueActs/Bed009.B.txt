dialogue type : z
B :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : z
B :  Yeah

dialogue type : z
B :  Thank You .

dialogue type : z
B :  OK Well , so Ralf and Tilman are here .

dialogue type : z
B :  Made it safely .

dialogue type : z
B :  Sure .

dialogue type : z
B :  OK

dialogue type : z
B :  and the way you do it is you just read the numbers not as uh each single ,

dialogue type : z
B :  so just like I do it .

dialogue type : z
B :  OK .

dialogue type : z
B :  First you read the transcript number .

dialogue type : z
B :  Turn .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  I thought two things

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  uh we 'll introduce ourselves and what we do .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  And um we already talked with Andreas , Thilo and David

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and some lines of code were already written today

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and almost tested

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and just gonna say we have um again the recognizer to parser thing where we 're working on

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and that should be no problem

dialogue type : s
B :  and then that can be sort of developed uh as needed when we get enter the tourism domain .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  em we have talked this morning with the with Tilman about the generator .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and um There one of our diligent workers has to sort of volunteer to look over Tilman 's shoulder while he is changing the grammars to English

dialogue type : s
B :  because w we have we face two ways .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  Either we do a syllable concatenating um grammar for the English generation which is sort of starting from scratch and doing it the easy way ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  or we simply adopt the ah um more in - depth um style that is implemented in the German system

dialogue type : s
B :  and um are then able not only to produce strings but also the syntactic parse

dialogue type : s^bsc.%--
B :  uh not parse not

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  the syntactic tree that is underneath in the syntactic structure

dialogue type : s^df^rt
B :  which is the way we decided we were gonna go because A , it 's easier in the beginning

dialogue type : s
B :  and um it does require some some knowledge of of those grammars and and and some ling linguistic background .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  But um it shouldn't be a problem for anyone .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  the the ultimate goal is that before they leave we we can run through the entire system input through output on at least one or two sample things .

dialogue type : s
B :  And um and by virtue of doing that then in this case Johno

dialogue type : s
B :  Ad infinitum .

dialogue type : s
B :  When needed , if needed , when wanted and so forth .

dialogue type : s
B :  And um also um Ralf has hooked up with David and you 're gonna continue either all through tonight or tomorrow on whatever to get the er parser interface working .

dialogue type : s
B :  They are thinning out and thickening out lattices

dialogue type : s
B :  and doing this kind of stuff to see what works best .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Should we already set a date for that ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Might be beneficial while we 're all here .

dialogue type : qy^cs^d^rt
B :  Thursday morning sounds fine ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  Neither does Thursday morning ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  no ?

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  Uh he will be in Washington , though .

dialogue type : s
B :  but um David is here and he 's actually knows everything about the SmartKom recognizer .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK so

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  facing to to what we 've sort of been doing here

dialogue type : h
B :  um

dialogue type : s
B :  well for one thing we 're also using this room to collect data .

dialogue type : fh|s.x
B :  um um Not this type of data ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  no not meeting data but sort of sort ah our version of a wizard experiment such

dialogue type : s
B :  not like the ones in Munich but pretty close to it .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  The major difference to the Munich ones is that we do it via the telephone

dialogue type : s
B :  even though all the recording is done here

dialogue type : s
B :  and so it 's a sort of a computer call system that gives you tourist information

dialogue type : s
B :  tells you how to get places .

dialogue type : s
B :  And it breaks halfway through the experiment and a human operator comes on .

dialogue type : s
B :  and part of that is sort of trying to find out whether people change their linguistic verbal behavior when first thinking they speak to a machine and then to a human .

dialogue type : s
B :  and we 're setting it up so that we can we hope to implant certain intentions in people .

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  For example um we have first looked at a simple sentence that " How do I get to the Powder - Tower ? "

dialogue type : s^f
B :  OK so you have the castle of Heidelberg

dialogue type : s
B :  and there is a tower and it 's called Powder - Tower .

dialogue type : qh
B :  and um so What will you parse out of that sentence ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Probably something that we specified in M - three - L ,

dialogue type : s
B :  that is @ @ " action go to whatever domain , object whatever Powder - Tower " .

dialogue type : s
B :  And maybe some model will tell us , some GPS module , in the mobile scenario where the person is at the moment .

dialogue type : s
B :  And um we 've sort of gone through that once before in the Deep Mail project

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I should 've brought some slides ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So here 's the tower .

dialogue type : s
B :  Think of this as a two - dimensional representation of the tower .

dialogue type : s
B :  And our system led people here , to a point where they were facing a wall in front of the tower .

dialogue type : s
B :  There is no entrance there , but it just happens to be the closest point of the road network to the geometric center

dialogue type : s
B :  Because that 's how the algorithm works .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  So we took out that part of the road network as a hack

dialogue type : s
B :  and then it found actually the way to the entrance .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  which was now the closest point of the road network to

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  OK , geometric center .

dialogue type : s
B :  But what we actually observed in Heidelberg is that most people when they want to go there they actually don't want to enter ,

dialogue type : sj^df
B :  because it 's not really interesting .

dialogue type : s
B :  They wanna go to a completely different point where they can look at it and take a picture .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And so what uh uh a s you s

dialogue type : s
B :  let 's say a simple parse from a s from an utterance won't really give us is what the person actually wants .

dialogue type : qy
B :  Does he wanna go there to see it ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Does he wanna go there now ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  Later ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  How does the person wanna go there ?

dialogue type : qy
B :  Is that person more likely to want to walk there ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  Walk a scenic route ?

dialogue type : s
B :  and so forth .

dialogue type : s
B :  There are all kinds of decisions that we have identified in terms of getting to places and in terms of finding information about things .

dialogue type : s
B :  And we are constructing and then we 've identified more or less the extra - linguistic parameters that may f play a role .

dialogue type : s
B :  Information related to the user and information related to the situation .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And we also want to look closely on the linguistic information that

dialogue type : s
B :  what we can get from the utterance .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's part of why we implant these intentions in the data collection to see whether people actually phrase things differently

dialogue type : s^e
B :  whether they want to enter in order to buy something or whether they just wanna go there to look at it .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And um so the idea is to construct uh um suitable interfaces and a belief - net for a module that actually tries to guess what the underlying intention was .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then enrich or augment the M - three - L structures with what it thought what more it sort of got out of that utterance .

dialogue type : s
B :  So if it can make a good suggestion , " Hey ! "

dialogue type : s
B :  you know , " that person doesn't wanna enter .

dialogue type : s
B :  That person just wants to take a picture , " cuz he just bought film ,

dialogue type : s
B :  or " that person wants to enter because he discussed the admission fee before " .

dialogue type : s
B :  Or " that person wants to enter because he wants to buy something

dialogue type : s
B :  and that you usually do inside of buildings " and so forth .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  These ah these types of uh these bits of additional information are going to be embedded into the M - three - L structure in an sort of subfield that we have reserved .

dialogue type : s
B :  And if the action planner does something with it , great .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  at least we want to offer the extra information . We don't really um we 're not too worried .

dialogue type : sj
B :  I mean t s Ultimately if you have if you can offer that information , somebody 's gonna s do something with it sooner or later .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's sort of part of our belief .

dialogue type : s
B :  Um , for example , right now I know the GIS from email is not able to calculate these viewpoints .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that 's a functionality that doesn't exist yet to do that dynamically ,

dialogue type : s.x
B :  but if we can offer it that distinction , maybe somebody will go ahead and implement it .

dialogue type : s
B :  Surely nobody 's gonna go ahead and implement it if it 's never gonna be used ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so .

dialogue type : qh
B :  What have I forgotten about ?

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Oh yeah ,

dialogue type : qh
B :  how we do it ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  yeah that 's the

dialogue type : h|s.x
B :  um so far I 've thought of it as sort of adding it onto the modeler knowledge module .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So this is one that already adds additional information to the

dialogue type : s
B :  but it could sit anywhere in the attention - recognition

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  uh Michael is doing that ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  But they uh

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Have I understood this right ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  It 's not really what you do with the content of the dialogue but it 's

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  So , I mean there is this this this nice interf

dialogue type : qy^bu.%--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : %-
B :  rea

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  yep

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
B :  yeah and um it might actually

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK

dialogue type : s
B :  ah also because um again in in Deep Map we have faced and implemented those problems once already

dialogue type : s
B :  maybe we can even shuffle some know how from there to to Markus and Michael .

dialogue type : h|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : %--
B :  OK th

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  I 'll I 'll talk to Michael

dialogue type : s
B :  it 's what I do anyway .

dialogue type : qw.%--
B :  Who How far is the uh the the M - three - L specification for for the la natural language input gone on the the uh

dialogue type : s
B :  I haven't seen anything for the uh tourist path domain .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  And um you are probably also involved in that ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  uh together with the usual gang ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  um Petra and Jan

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qo
B :  I think the the true key issues is how does the whatever comes out of the language input pipeline look like

dialogue type : qo
B : 

dialogue type : qo
B :  and how that is uh specified .

dialogue type : s
B :  I didn't think of the internal working of the uh the action planner and the language uh the function model as sort of relevant .

dialogue type : s
B :  Because what what they take is sort of this this fixed representation of a of an intention .

dialogue type : s
B :  And that can be as detailed or as crude as you want it to be .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  whether you know there 're dialogue action planners that work with belief - nets that are action planners that work with you know state automata .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that shouldn't really matter too much .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean it does matter

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  we are on part six of r a route that consists of eight steps and so forth

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Probably close to impossible .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's external services .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah I think just the the spatial planner and the route planner

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  I showed you once the interac action between them among them in the deep map system

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  so a printout of the communication between those two fills up

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't know how many pages

dialogue type : s
B :  and that 's just part of how do I get to one place .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's really insane .

dialogue type : fh
B :  and uh

dialogue type : s
B :  but um so this is um definitely a good point to get uh Michael into the discussion .

dialogue type : s
B :  Or to enter his discussion , actually .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's the way around .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  Markus

dialogue type : qy^rt.%--
B :  Is he new in the in the ?

dialogue type : qy
B :  Is he gonna continue with the old uh thing ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yes I was just that 's my next question

dialogue type : s
B :  whether we 're we 're gonna stick to Prolog or not .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK

dialogue type : s
B :  But I do think the the function modeling concept has a certain makes sense in a in a certain light

dialogue type : s
B :  because the action planner should not be or the dialogue manager in that case should not um w have to worry about whether it 's interfacing with um something that does route planning in this way or that way

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
B :  huh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  it j

dialogue type : s
B :  and it cant sort of formulate its what it wants in a in a rather a abstract uh way ,

dialogue type : s
B :  you know f " Find me a good route for this . "

dialogue type : s
B :  It doesn't really have to worry ab how route planner A or how route planner B actually wants it .

dialogue type : s
B :  So this is seemed like a good idea .

dialogue type : s
B :  In the beginning .

dialogue type : b
B :  hmm

dialogue type : s^2.%--
B :  a lot of ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah , there is another philosophical issue that I think you know you can evade

dialogue type : s
B :  but , at at least it makes sense to me that sooner or later uh a service is gonna come and describe itself to you .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and that 's sort of what Srini is working on in in in the DAML uh project where um you you find a GIS about that gives you information on Berkeley ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and it 's it 's gonna be there and tell you what it can do and how it wants to do things .

dialogue type : s
B :  and so you can actually interface to such a system without ever having met it before

dialogue type : s
B :  and the function modeler and a self - description of the um external service haggle it out

dialogue type : s
B :  and you can use the same language core , understanding core to interface with planner - A , planner - B , planner - C and so forth .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  completely utopian at the moment ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but slowly , you know , getting into the realm of the uh contingent .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  But we are facing of course much more um realistic problems .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  And language input for example , is of course uh crucial you know also when you do the sort of deep understanding analysis that we envision .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B :  um Then of course , the uh um , you know

dialogue type : qo
B : 

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  poverty of the stimulus ,

dialogue type : s
B :  yet the m uh the less we get of that the better .

dialogue type : fh|qo
B :  and um so we we 're thinking , for example how much syntactic analysis actually happens already in the parser .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and whether one could interface to that potentially

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  A Alan ?

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  From Michael Strube , I 've heard very good stuff about the chunk parser that is done by FORWISS ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , which is in embassy doing the parsing .

dialogue type : s
B :  So this is sort of came as a surprise to me that you know , embassy s is featuring a nice parser

dialogue type : s
B :  but it 's what I hear . One could also look at that and see whether there is some synergy possible .

dialogue type : s
B :  And they 're doing chunk parsing

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I I can give you the names of the people who do it there .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But um .

dialogue type : s
B :  Then there is of course more ways of parsing things .

dialogue type : s
B :  We threw out all the forms .

dialogue type : s^r
B :  We threw out all the forms

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because , you know , English ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  Well there 's m I 'm sure there 's gonna be more discussion on that after your talk .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  We 're just gonna foreshadow what we saw that

dialogue type : fh
B :  and um

dialogue type : s
B :  First steps .

dialogue type : s
B :  And she 's gonna start

dialogue type : s^e
B :  in a minute .
