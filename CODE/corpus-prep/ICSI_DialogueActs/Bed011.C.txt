dialogue type : z
C :  Now can you give me the uh remote T ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Alright .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , I 've I uh it 's not that I didn't try .

dialogue type : s
C :  and um I I told it to stay on forever and ever , but if it 's not plugged in it just doesn't obey my commands .

dialogue type : s
C :  It has a mind .

dialogue type : s
C :  But I I just You know , sort of keep on wiggling .

dialogue type : s
C :  But uh we 'll just be m m working on it at intensity so it doesn't happen .

dialogue type : b
C :  We 'll see .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Should we plunge right into it ?

dialogue type : qy.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  So what I 've tried to do here is list all the decision nodes that we have identified on this side .

dialogue type : s
C :  Commented and what they 're about and sort of the properties we may um give them .

dialogue type : s
C :  And here are the uh tasks to be implemented via our data collection .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  The reading is out of these tasks more or less imply that the user wants to go there , sometime or the other .

dialogue type : s
C :  And analogously for example , here we have our EVA um intention .

dialogue type : s
C :  And these are the data tasks where w we can assume the person would like to enter , view or just approach the thing .

dialogue type : s
C :  Analogously the same on the object information

dialogue type : s
C :  we can see that , you know , we have sort of created these tasks before we came up with our decision nodes

dialogue type : s
C :  so there 's a lot of things where we have no analogous tasks , and that may or may not be a problem .

dialogue type : s
C :  We can change the tasks slightly if we feel that we should have data for e sort of for every decision node

dialogue type : s
C :  so trying to im um implant the intention of going to a place now , going to a place later on the same tour ,

dialogue type : s
C :  or trying to plant the intention of going sometime on the next tour , or the next day or whenever .

dialogue type : s
C :  But I think that might be overdoing it a little .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  Well how people phrase different intentions more or less ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
C :  huh ?

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Maybe it was too fast plunging in there , because j we have two updates .

dialogue type : s
C :  Um you can look at this if you want ,

dialogue type : s
C :  these are what our subject 's going to have to fill out .

dialogue type : s
C :  Any comments I can can still be made and the changes will be put in correspondingly .

dialogue type : s
C :  Let me summarize in two sentences ,

dialogue type : s.x
C :  mainly for Eva 's benefit , who probably has not heard about the data collection , at all .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
C :  Or have you heard about it ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
C :  No .

dialogue type : s
C :  OK . We were gonna put this in front of people .

dialogue type : s
C :  They give us some information on themselves .

dialogue type : s
C :  Then then they will read uh a task where lots of German words are sort of thrown in between .

dialogue type : s
C :  And um and they have to read isolated proper names

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  No , this is not the release form .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  This is the speaker information form .

dialogue type : s
C :  The release form is over there in that box .

dialogue type : s
C :  And um And then they gonna have to f um um choose from one of these tasks , which are listed here .

dialogue type : s
C :  They they pick a couple ,

dialogue type : s
C :  say three uh uh six as a matter of fact .

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : h|s
C :  and um and they have a map .

dialogue type : s
C :  Like this .

dialogue type : s
C :  Very sketchy , simplified map .

dialogue type : s
C :  And they can take notes on that map .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  And then they call this computer system that works perfectly , and understands everything .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  The comp Yeah , the computer system sits right in front of you ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  that 's Fey .

dialogue type : s
C :  And she has a way of making this machine talk .

dialogue type : s
C :  So she can copy sentences into a window , or type really fast

dialogue type : s
C :  and this machine will use speech synthesis to produce that .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So if you ask " How do I get to the castle " then a m s several seconds later it 'll come out of here " In order to get to the castle you do "

dialogue type : qy^f^rt
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
C :  And um And then after three tasks the system breaks down .

dialogue type : s
C :  And Fey comes on the phone as a human operator .

dialogue type : s
C :  And says " Sorry the system broke down but let 's continue . "

dialogue type : s
C :  And we sort of get the idea what people do when they s think they speak to a machine and what people say when they think they speak to a human , or know , or assume they speak to a human .

dialogue type : s^bs
C :  That 's the data collection .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  And um And Fey has some thirty subjects lined up ?

dialogue type : %-
C :  Something ?

dialogue type : s
C :  And um And they 're r ready uh to roll .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  And we 're gonna start tomorrow at three ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  four ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  one ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  Around four - ish .

dialogue type : s
C :  And um we 're still l looking for a room on the sixth floor because they stole away that conference room . Um behind our backs .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , but I i i it 's happening .

dialogue type : s
C :  David and and Jane and and Lila are working on that as we speak .

dialogue type : s
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bs
C :  That was the uh the data collection in a nutshell .

dialogue type : h|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^t1.%--
C :  so if I click on here ,

dialogue type : qy^t1
C :  Isn't this wonderful ?

dialogue type : s
C :  we get to the uh uh belief - net just focusing on on the g Go - there node .

dialogue type : s
C :  uh Analogously this would be sort of the reason node and the timing node and so forth .

dialogue type : s
C :  And what w what happened is that um design - wise I 'd sort of n noticed that we can we still get a lot of errors from a lot of points to one of these sub Go - there User Go - there Situation nodes .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So I came up with a couple of additional nodes here where um

dialogue type : s
C :  whether the user is thrifty or not , and what his budget is currently like , is going to result in some financial state of the user .

dialogue type : qh
C :  How much will he is he willing to spend ?

dialogue type : s^bsc
C :  Or can spend .

dialogue type : s
C :  Being the same at this just the money available , which may influence us , whether he wants to go there

dialogue type : s^e.%--
C :  if it is you know charging tons of dollars for admission or its gonna g cost a lot of t e

dialogue type : s
C :  whatever .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  Twenty - two million to fly to International Space Station , you know .

dialogue type : s
C :  just Not all people can do that .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^t1
C :  let 's go to our favorite endpoint one

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  then the situation nodes contributing to the the endpoint situation node , which contributes to the endpoint and so forth .

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  everything that comes from situation , everything that comes from user goes with the sub - U ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and whatever we specify for the so - called " Keith node " , or the discourse , what comes from the um parser , construction parser , um will contribute to the D and the ontology to the sub - O node .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And um one just s sort of has to watch which also final decision node so it doesn't make sense t to figure out whether he wants to enter , view or approach an object if he never wants to go there in the first place .

dialogue type : s
C :  But this makes the design thing fairly simple .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And um now all w that 's left to do then is the CPG 's , the conditional probabilities , for the likelihood of a person having enough money , actually wanting to go a place if it costs , you know this or that .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And um OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  and once um Bhaskara has finished his classwork that 's where we 're gonna end up doing .

dialogue type : s
C :  You get involved in that process too .

dialogue type : fh|qh
C :  And um And for now uh the the question is " How much of these decisions do we want to build in explicitly into our data collection ? "

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  you know we could call the z see or you know , people who visit the zoo

dialogue type : s
C :  we could s call it " Visit the zoo tomorrow " ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so we have an intention of seeing something , but not now but later .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm , hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^df
C :  Yeah The the reason why we did it that way , as a as a reminder , is uh no person is gonna do all of them .

dialogue type : s
C :  They 're just gonna select u um , according to their preferences .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  " Ah , yeah , I usually visit zoos , or I usually visit castles , or I usually "

dialogue type : s
C :  And then you pick that one .

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , the this was sort of these are all different sort of activities .

dialogue type : s
C :  Um But I think y I I got the point and I think I like it .

dialogue type : s
C :  We can do put them in a more hierarchical fashion .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , " Go to place " and then give them a choice ,

dialogue type : s
C :  you know either they 're the symphony type or opera type or the tourist site guide type or the nightclub disco type person and they say " yeah this is on that " go to big - ish place " ,

dialogue type : s
C :  this is what I would do . "

dialogue type : s
C :  And then we have the " Fix " thing , and then maybe " Do something the other day " thing ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I guess , to some extent , we should y we just have to try it out and see if it works .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  It would be challenging , in in a sense , to try to make it so so complex that they even really should schedule , or to plan it , uh , a more complex thing in terms of

dialogue type : h
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
C :  you know , they should get the feeling that there are these s six things they have to do

dialogue type : s
C :  and they sh can be done maybe in two days .

dialogue type : s
C :  So they make these decisions ,

dialogue type : qh
C :  " Can I go there tomorrow ? "

dialogue type : s
C :  or you know influences

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^arp
C :  Yeah , but I think this is part of the instructor 's job .

dialogue type : s
C :  And that can be done , sort of to say , " OK now we 've picked these six tasks . "

dialogue type : s
C :  " Now you have you can call the system and you have two days . "

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And th w

dialogue type : b
C :  Yep , yep .

dialogue type : s^aap|s^ng
C :  Yeah , but th the I don't I 'm not really interested in sort of " Phase planning " capabilities .

dialogue type : qh
C :  But it 's more the how do people phrase these planning requests ?

dialogue type : qy
C :  So are we gonna masquerade the system as this as you said simple response system ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  " I have one question I get one response " ,

dialogue type : qrr
C :  or should we allow for a certain level of complexity .

dialogue type : s
C :  And a I w think the data would be nicer if we get temporal references .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  I mean w we have tested this and a y

dialogue type : qy^rt.%--
C :  have you heard listen to the f first two or th

dialogue type : s
C :  as a matter of fact the second person is uh is was faced with exactly this kind of setup .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  That was the first subject .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Um , it is already with this it got pretty with this setup and that particular subject it got pretty complex .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Maybe I suggest we make some fine tuning of these , get sort of run through ten or so subjects

dialogue type : s
C :  and then take a breather ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and see whether we wanna make it more complex or not , depending on what what sort of results we 're getting .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  And with this we 're getting more .

dialogue type : s
C :  No question .

dialogue type : qy.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  no transcriptions of course ,

dialogue type : b
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Until we reach the gigabyte thing and David Johnson s ki kills me . And we 're gonna put it on the web site . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  No , he uh , he he has been solving all our problems or is wonderful ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  so s

dialogue type : s
C :  The reading task is a lot shorter .

dialogue type : s
C :  That was cut by fifty percent .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And the reading ,

dialogue type : s
C :  nobody 's interested in that except for the speech people .

dialogue type : %--
C :  So .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's actually like five minutes dialogue .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  Ten minutes is long .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  It feels like forever when you 're doing it ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but then it turns out to be three minutes and forty five seconds .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  And it 's fun .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I need those back by the way .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C :  And

dialogue type : s^ar.%--
C :  no , th the per

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  the person don't get it .

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  I mean , this is why we did it , because when we gave them just three tasks for w part - A and three tasks for part - B a

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s^bs
C :  This is limiting the choices , but yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^fa
C :  OK , sorry .

dialogue type : s
C :  But um I I think this approach will very well work ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but the person was able to look at it and say " OK , This is what I would actually do . "

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^nd.%--
C :  But no , they 're I mean they 're sort of this is where tour becomes you know

dialogue type : s
C :  tourists maybe a bit different

dialogue type : s
C :  and , um , these are just places where you you enter um , much like here .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  mm - hmm Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
C :  Attend ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm , mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  th the function stuff is definitely different and the getting information or g stuff yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  But this is open .

dialogue type : s
C :  So since people gonna still pick something , we we 're not gonna get any significant amount of redundancy .

dialogue type : s
C :  And for reasons , we don't want it , really , in that sense .

dialogue type : s
C :  And um we would be ultimately more interested in getting all the possible ways of people asking , oh , for different things with or with a computer .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  And so if you can think of any other sort of high level tasks a tourist may do just always just m mail them to us and we 'll sneak them into the collection .

dialogue type : s
C :  We 're not gonna do much statistical stuff with it .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  No .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  But it seems like since we since we are getting towards uh subject uh fifty subjects

dialogue type : s
C :  and if we can keep it up um to a uh sort of five four - ish per week rate , we may even reach the one hundred before Fey t takes off to Chicago .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
C :  Okay , in terms of decision nodes ?

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , Go - there is is a yes or no .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm also interested in th in this " property " uh line here ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  so if you look at sorry , look at that

dialogue type : s
C :  um , timing was um I have these three .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Do we need a final differentiation there ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  Now , later on the same tour , sometimes on the next tour .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's sort of next day ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so you 're doing something now and you have planned to do these three four things ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  and you can do something immediately ,

dialogue type : s
C :  you could sort of tag it on to that tour

dialogue type : s
C :  or you can say this is something I would do s I wanna do sometime l in my life , basically .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  Well , my visit to Prague there were some nights where I never went back to the hotel ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so whether that counts as a two - day tour or not we 'll have to think .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't know .

dialogue type : qw
C :  What is the uh the the English co uh um cognate if you want , for " Sankt Nimmerlandstag " ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Sort of " We 'll do it on when you say on that d day it means it 'll never happen .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Do you have an expression ?

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
C :  Probably you sh

dialogue type : s^aa|s^m
C :  Yeah , when hell Yep , we 'll do it when hell freezes over .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  So maybe that should be another property in there .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  Um , the reason why why do we go there in the first place

dialogue type : s
C :  IE uh it 's either uh for sightseeing , for meeting people , for running errands , or doing business .

dialogue type : sj^ba
C :  Entertainment is a good one in there , I think .

dialogue type : sj^ba
C :  I agree .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean this w this is uh an old uh Johno thing .

dialogue type : s
C :  He sort of had it in there .

dialogue type : qh
C :  " Who is the the tour is the person ? "

dialogue type : s
C :  So it might be a tourist ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Eh , just meeting people , basically .

dialogue type : s
C :  " I want to meet someone somewhere " , which be puts a very heavy constraint on the " EVA "

dialogue type : s
C :  you know , because then if you 're meeting somebody at the town hall , you 're not entering it usually ,

dialogue type : s
C :  you 're just want to approach it .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
C :  That goes with the " energy depletion " function , blech .

dialogue type : s^tc.%-
C :  OK , " endpoint " .

dialogue type : s
C :  " Endpoint " is pretty clear .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
C :  Um , " mode " ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  uh , I have found three ,

dialogue type : s
C :  " drive there " , " walk there " uh or " be driven " , which means bus , taxi , BART .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So this granularity would suffice , I think w if we say the person

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  probably , based on the utterance we on the situation we can conclude

dialogue type : s
C :  wants to drive there , walk there , or use some other form of transportation .

dialogue type : s
C :  Everywhere .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , um we actually biking should be should be a separate point because we have a very strong bicycle planning component .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So .

dialogue type : %-
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Bicycles c should be in there ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  but ,

dialogue type : qy^rt.%--
C :  will we have bic

dialogue type : qh^rt
C :  I mean is this realistic ?

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.x
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^rt
C :  OK , " Length " is um , you wanna get this over with as fast as possible ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  you wanna use some part of what of the time you have .

dialogue type : h|s^aa^rt
C :  Um , they can .

dialogue type : s^arp^cs^df
C :  But we should just make a decision whether we feel that they want to use some substantial or some fraction of their time .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  You know , they wanna do it so badly that they are willing to spend uh you know the necessary and plus time .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  And y you know , if we feel that they wanna do nothing but that thing then , you know , we should point out that to the planner , that they probably want to use all the time they have .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  So , stretch out that visit for that .

dialogue type : s
C :  Th - the user can always s say it , but it 's just sort of we we hand over these parameters if we make if we have a feeling that they are important .

dialogue type : s
C :  And that we can actually infer them to a significant de degree , or we ask .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And if no no part of the system ever comes up with the idea that this could be important , no planner is ever gonna ask for it .

dialogue type : sj^ba.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  Jerry pushed this idea from the very beginning , that it 's part of the understanding business to sort of make a good question of what 's s sort of important in this general picture , what you need t

dialogue type : qh
C :  If you wanna simulate it , for example , what parameters would you need for the simulation ?

dialogue type : s
C :  And , Timing , uh , uh , Length would definitely be part of it ,

dialogue type : qh^rt
C :  " Costs " ,

dialogue type : qo^rt
C :  " Little money , some money , lots of money " ?

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  Actually , maybe uh F uh so , F

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : qw^br
C :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , I I once had to write a a a a charter , a carter for a a student organization .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  And they had wanted me to define what the quorum is going to be .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  And I wrote in there " En - Enough " people have to be there .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it was hotly debated , but people agreed with me that everybody probably has a good feeling whether it was a farce , a joke , or whether there were enough people .

dialogue type : s:qw
C :  And if you go to Turkey , you will find when people go shopping , they will say " How much cheese do you want ? "

dialogue type : s
C :  and they say " Ah , enough . "

dialogue type : s
C :  And the and the this used all over the place .

dialogue type : s
C :  Because the person selling the cheese knows , you know , that person has two kids and you know , a husband that dislikes cheese , so this is enough .

dialogue type : s
C :  And um so the middle part is always sort of the the golden way ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  So you can s you can be really make it as cheap as possible , or you can say " I want , er , you know , I don't care "

dialogue type : s^aa^m
C :  Money is no object ,

dialogue type : s
C :  or you say " I just want to spend enough " .

dialogue type : s
C :  Or the sufficient , or the the appropriate amount .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , Then again , this may turn out to be insufficient for our purposes .

dialogue type : s
C :  But well , this is my first guess ,

dialogue type : qh
C :  in much the same way as how how d you know should the route be ?

dialogue type : qh^rt
C :  Should it be the easiest route , even if it 's a b little bit longer ?

dialogue type : qh^d^rt
C :  No steep inclinations ?

dialogue type : qh^d^rt
C :  Go the normal way ?

dialogue type : qy
C :  Whatever that again means , er or do you does the person wanna rough it ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , this is all sort of um , top of my head .

dialogue type : s
C :  No no research behind that .

dialogue type : s^rt^tc
C :  Um " Object information " ,

dialogue type : s:qh^rt
C :  " Do I do I wanna know anything about that object ? "

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  is either true or false .

dialogue type : s
C :  And . if I care about it being open , accessible or not , I don't think there 's any middle ground there .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  Um , either I wanna know where it is or not ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  I wanna know about it 's history or not ,

dialogue type : s
C :  or , um I wanna know about what it 's good for or not .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Maybe one could put scales in there , too .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  So I wanna know a l lot about it .

dialogue type : s
C :  One could put scales in there .

dialogue type : s
