dialogue type : qy^bu^d.%--
F :  for

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , we I just started recognition on the on Thilo 's segments ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  but using the far far

dialogue type : s^bsc
F :  the close - talking microphone .

dialogue type : s
F :  And you wanted I know you wanted the far - field data .

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  To retrain ?

dialogue type : h
F :  Uh

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's about right .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  It depends on who else is using machines ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but we have more machines now .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's more like a day , probably .

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  three or four percent absolute .

dialogue type : h|s^nd
F :  Um , not for meetings .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because we didn't train we didn't re ever recognize with the with the small models on meeting data .

dialogue type : s
F :  But I I have the models ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  so I could run reco

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  I mean , the the mmm

dialogue type : s^df
F :  The recognition also takes non - negligible amount of time .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So we might wanna restrict it to , maybe , a few meetings ,

dialogue type : s
F :  if you want to do a full comparison .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qr
F :  Well , do we have the do we have the processed data ?

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  I see .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I recently retrained , um , for another reason , on the full training set .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  And that took only I think it took only two days .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , it 's actually conceivable to do use the full training set .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm . Uh .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s
F :  something something like something between thirty and fifty hours , maybe .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  I f I forget the exac

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : h|s^no
F :  Uh . Actually , I don't know .

dialogue type : s
F :  I 'd I I can look it up .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  It 's it 's it 's just ,

dialogue type : s
F :  uh , I don't know the remember the the number .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , the males account for most of this meeting data anyhow .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs^na
F :  Yeah . I would say we you do only males .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
F :  u

dialogue type : s
F :  No . It 's definitely It 's less than a hundred hours , for sure .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's probably actually , uh It 's uh , I think it 's around thirty hours

dialogue type : s
F :  just for for one gender .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
F :  No . I didn't do that ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because we haven't even cut the waveforms for that .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  And there 's a bit of a question whether you want to use um , what segmentations you want to use .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^fa
F :  Um , I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : s
F :  Don just , uh , created a new version of the first meetings that we had previously recognized ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but with different segmentation .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  to use those segmentations ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because th then we could claim that everything 's automatic .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  It will uh , it will probably be a couple hours before before I have some results .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  But the segmentations matter for the filtering .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk^m|s^bk
F :  For the test set . Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  But , first first , of course , you would wanna process the training data ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  because we wanna get that started .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^arp^cs^rt
F :  Ma - maybe you should limit ourselves to the Meeting Recorder meetings ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  if you were gonna cut down on the test set , I would suggest that .

dialogue type : s
F :  Actually , the longer the Robustness meetings take longer ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  because there 's this one speaker who talks a lot .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And so

dialogue type : %--
F :  the Um .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  you have to d you have to , uh , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  you cannot chop it up into small pieces .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , you 're sort of limited by how long the longest speaker , uh , is s speaking .

dialogue type : s
F :  So how much data there is from the the speaker who talks the most .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , um , you parallelize across different speakers ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but you know , if you have a bunch of speakers who speak very little and then one wh who who speaks a lot , then effectively , everybody waits for the longest one to process .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  That was both types of meetings ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but most but there were only two Robustness meetings , and four or five , uh , Meeting Recorders .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : h
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : h
F : 

dialogue type : s^no.%-
F :  I don't have I don't have a good gue

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  For everything ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^e^rt
F :  For all the meetings ?

dialogue type : h
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : h
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's probably more than a day ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but probably less than two .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , i No . I mean for all the meetings .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F :  Because it 's Again , it 's ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bd^df
F :  Again , we we I ran when we ran these , we were sort of short on machines ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  and , um ,

dialogue type : s^df^no
F :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I I would estimate maybe four hours per meeting .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Something like that .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  Right . Right . So that 's why I 'm saying I 'm not sure how they would scale with more machines .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^t1.%--
F :  two , th We have two , three , four , fi

dialogue type : s
F :  I think there are four Meeting Recorder meetings that we worked with .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  Five ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : h|qy^bu^d^rt
F :  Uh , with the Robust - compared to Robustness ?

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  The big variation is by whether it 's a native speaker or not .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  and and of course what , um , you know , whether it 's lapel or , uh , headset microphone .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  And we can exclude we don't need to recognize the non - natives ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b^rt
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy.%--
F :  Wait , did ?

dialogue type : qr
F :  So when you used original the original models , and you just process the test set in this way , d do you get any do you get decent performance or not ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Mmm . Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs^t^tc.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  well , the first the one that already has a

dialogue type : s^t1
F :  cross there .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  We need to re - do that with small models .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then , have to ask , um , I guess , Don to , uh , cut the , um , cut the segments for the sh for the tis distant mike .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  Uh , uh that 's So we would be using the same channel for each fo for everything ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
F :  No , no . We would use the same segmentations ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but he needs to extract extract the wavef form segments from a different channel .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : h|s^aa
F :  Um Yeah .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  If assuming that the performance turns out to be comparable with with the old experiments and the old segmentations .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fg|s^t^tc
F :  Oh , OK . So there 's the issue of speaker normalization .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , with the distant microphone you wouldn't know which speaker is talking .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^j^rt
F :  I see . So you want to cheat ?

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  OK . So we assume we assume knowledge of the speakers as as , um in a way that 's compatible with the close - talking test set .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%--
F :  No . It means No . It just means

dialogue type : s
F :  you you group together the segments that by magic you know belong to one speaker ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  Well , in the new test , actually , that 's not true .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  So Again , if this if these new segmentations work OK , then we then it 's a fair it 's a completely fair test .

dialogue type : s
F :  You group together all the data coming in through one channel

dialogue type : s
F :  and where Thilo 's speech detector has has determined that there is speech .

dialogue type : s
F :  And that speech is is deemed to come from that speaker , whether that 's true or not .

dialogue type : s
F :  So if you get some cross - talk from another microphone , then you just process this it as if it were from that speaker .

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  Well , that 's more of a problem .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F :  I mean , because it 's You can just pretend it 's some kind of gene

dialogue type : s^bd
F :  I mean you can pretend it 's all from one speaker

dialogue type : s^bd
F :  and do all this processing the same ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but then you 're gonna get results that are worse on account of not doing proper speaker normalization

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So , you could certainly do better than that by doing , for instance uh , cluster the segments ,

dialogue type : s
F :  which is what we do , say , in a Broadcast News system , where you don't have speaker labels .

dialogue type : s
F :  But that would be another processing step that I 'm I would have to debug first , and so forth ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and so we wanna avoid that .

dialogue type : s
F :  So I agree with you . We should we should , uh , do the you know , this sort of cheating experiment .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  It 's not just speaker adaptation .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's the whole norm feature normalization process .

dialogue type : s
F :  I it 's spea uh , all that is speaker - based .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So , in that I 'm ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Y you know , d d b the most important , of course , is the cepstral mean subtraction .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^no.%--
F :  I don't remember ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because it 's so far s so long ago that we didn't do that on a per speaker basis ,

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : fg
F :  A and by the way ,

dialogue type : s
F :  it 's actually we 're we 're already If we use the same segmentations that we use for the close - talking microphone , then the segmentations assume that we have access to all channels

dialogue type : s
F :  and cross correlate them ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so there 's no point in not using that knowledge for speaker identification .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|qw^rt
F :  Right . So what what is the schedule here ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^j
F :  Oh , we 'll call you when you get there .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s^e
F :  the the test data for the far far microphone .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  If if it turns out that for some reason it 's easier for him to use the old um , the the the old ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^bk^m|s^cs
F :  segmentations , then we 'll just use that , I figure .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : h
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um Right . Uh , let 's see . The the

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
F :  You you can I mean you could you could run the ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  you c Basically , once the , um , whe the top the top one 's done , you could easily re - run the whole set of experiments .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Uh , I mean , manage the jobs and so forth ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh Um ,

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
F :  Assuming he uses the new naming scheme , then he should call the waveforms

dialogue type : s
F :  the so , the waveform names have the , you know , meeting meeting ID ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and the microphone ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  some something that identifies the speaker .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  Exactly . So , uh well , you still need to be able to distinguish the different speakers .

dialogue type : s
F :  That 's the key point .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So Uh , uh , the the best the easiest way to do that would be to just take You know , you make the channel be channel F ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
F :  but then keep the speaker names the same as they would be in the old in the close - talking , uh , version .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right . Exactly .

dialogue type : s
F :  I , uh , I I can talk to him .

dialogue type : s^j
F :  Well , they grow them on trees now .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
F :  Just , you shake them and they fall down .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
F :  Mm - hmm ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm . Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na|s
F :  That 's everything . Yeah ,

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So , I can give you a list of the short version .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Wel - No , it is .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^fa
F :  Sorry .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Um . Can you repeat the question ?

dialogue type : s^m.%--
F :  There wa it is a subse

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
F :  No . Only the portion that was in the Hub - five training set .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , the Hub - five small training set contains as much Macrophone as the large training set , for historical reasons .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
F : 

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Because you already did did y didn't you already do that experiment ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm . OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  And you need only the males .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : qy.%--
F :  Does this th this ?

dialogue type : s
F :  It - it 's sort of f f not very nice to use the small training set for another reason ,

dialogue type : s
F :  which is that the you also are losing on Again , because you don't use all the data you have for one speaker .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  So , the normalizations you compute for your training speakers will be , uh , crummier than they would in the large training set .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  uh , I have to use short models that were trained on normalizations that were also only estimated on the short set .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^am
F :  I think so .

dialogue type : s
F :  I 've I I have to check .

dialogue type : s
F :  In any case , I could retrain short models within a few hours actually at if I use machines at SRI .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  No . But the thing is , if if we used if we used the whole training set for normalizations , then David would have to process much more data ,

dialogue type : s
F :  which That 's a that 's one bottleneck , for us

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  in terms of get

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So , you wanna do the exact same thing ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  or else you 'll have apples and oranges .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^bd^rt
F :  It doesn't make I don't think it makes that much of a difference .

dialogue type : s^cs^df
F :  It 's just this little detail that if you can take care of that , then you should .

dialogue type : s
F :  I I think I have I have the models ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  I have I have ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^t1.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah . And if not I can retrain those models very quickly .

dialogue type : h
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^ba^nd
F :  Yeah . I don't think it 'll make a matter .

dialogue type : s
F :  In fact , I thought about throwing those out too ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because when I heard how little speech there was for some of them , I thought they can only hurt your models ,

dialogue type : s
F :  because they 're again their normalizations will be all all all over the map ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and you won't get very very clean models from them , anyhow .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  In fact , if if you wanna do this , uh , to speed things up , um , you we can leave out the Macrophone data altogether .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  Actually .

dialogue type : s^fa
F :  Oh , no . Sorry .

dialogue type : s
F :  Not in the short .

dialogue type : s
F :  Then you have too little data .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^fa|s^co
F :  Sorry . Forget that .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  When you use when you go to the large training set , then leaving out Macrophone actually sometimes helps you ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because it 's it it 's just not relevant to the to the meeting and or to conversational speech anyway .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Yeah . Leave it out ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  and Um , in the event that I retrain the short models ,

dialogue type : qh^cs
F :  um , why don't you give me a list of the files that you throw out ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and I I 'll throw them out , too .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then we have complete completely identical training conditions .

dialogue type : s
F :  But th the segmentations are only they only affect the test set .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  We 're talking about the training speakers .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  He already has the in you already have the information .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK . Alright .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .
