dialogue type : s
A :  OK , we 're on .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  Oh , this was the , uh , talk where they were supposed to try to decide

dialogue type : b
A :  Ah , right .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  What 's the allowable ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  What were they thinking of changing it to ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Ah !

dialogue type : qw^br^d^rt
A :  Think of it as what ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  And I don't think anybody 's gonna notice the difference between a quarter of a second of latency and thirty milliseconds of latency .

dialogue type : h|s
A :  Um , we had a silence detector ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so

dialogue type : s
A :  we would look for the end of an utterance based on the silence detector .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  And I I can't remember now off the top of my head how many frames of silence we had to detect before we would declare it to be the end of an utterance .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  but it was ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I would say it was probably around the order of two hundred and fifty milliseconds .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
A :  we did the back trace at that point

dialogue type : s^e
A :  to get the answer .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  No ,

dialogue type : s^na
A :  no it was pretty quick .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A :  this w

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  And it felt to , uh , the users that it was instantaneous .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  I mean , as fast as talking to a person .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  It th I don't think anybody ever complained about the delay .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I don't remember the exact numbers

dialogue type : %--
A :  but

dialogue type : s
A :  it was something like that .

dialogue type : s
A :  I don't think you can really tell .

dialogue type : s
A :  A person I don't think a person can tell the difference between , uh , you know , a quarter of a second and a hundred milliseconds ,

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'm not even sure if we can tell the difference between a quarter of a second and half a second .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I mean it just it feels so quick .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , it may feel different than talking to a person

dialogue type : s^df^rt
A :  because when we talk to each other we tend to step on each other 's utterances .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  So like if I 'm asking you a question , you may start answering before I 'm even done .

dialogue type : s
A :  So it it would probably feel different

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  but I don't think it would feel slow .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  So is the latency from the neural net caused by how far ahead you 're looking ?

dialogue type : qy.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Was it in the , uh , recurrent neural nets where they weren't looking ahead at all ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
A :  A little bit .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  We 've always had usually we used the symmetric windows

dialogue type : fh
A :  but

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw^br^d^rt
A :  Change the what ?

dialogue type : s^br
A :  I 'm missing that last word .

dialogue type : s^e.%-
A :  Context

dialogue type : s^bk^m
A :  KLT .

dialogue type : s^bk^m^r
A :  Oh , KLT .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  What is the advantage of that ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bh^d
A :  Really ?

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
A :  Huh !

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
A :  Hmm !

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
A :  Oh !

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
A :  Hmm !

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
A :  Hmm !

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is the estimate of the noise spectrum a running estimate ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm !

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  So do you is there some long window that extends into the past over which you calculate the average ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  A couple seconds ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  But wh don't they overlap sometimes ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  it seems like this kind of thing could add to the latency .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I mean , depending on where the window was that you used to calculate the signal - to - noise ratio .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
A :  well that I guess that was my question ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Guess .

dialogue type : qy^rt.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  We could probably get a really good estimate of the noise if we just went to the noise files ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
A :  and built the averages from them .

dialogue type : s
A :  Very slow adaptation .

dialogue type : %-
A :  th

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  If they 're going to provide a , uh , voice activity detector that will tell you the boundaries of the speech , then , couldn't you just go outside those boundaries and do your estimate there ?

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  What are what are some of the low level detectors that they use ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy.%--
A :  And so are each of these , low level detectors are they ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : qy
A :  are these something that you decide ahead of time ,

dialogue type : qy^d^e
A :  like " I 'm going to look for this particular feature

dialogue type : qrr^d^e^rt
A :  or I 'm going to look at this frequency , "

dialogue type : qrr.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qw
A :  What what what are they looking at ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  What are their inputs ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Ah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^bk^r
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  How did they measure the performance of their detector ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy.%-
A : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Didn't they also do some kind of an oracle experiment

dialogue type : qy^d^e^rt
A :  where they said " if we could detect the sonorants perfectly and then show how it would improve speech recognition ?

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I thought I remember hearing about an experiment like that .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  When we when we talked with John Ohala the other day we made a list of some of the things that w

dialogue type : s^e
A :  like frication ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  abrupt closure ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  R - coloring ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  nasality ,

dialogue type : s^e
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
A :  There 's also things like stress .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  You can look at stress .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
A :  there 's a few cases where it can like permit and permit .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  But that 's not very common in English .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  In other languages it 's more uh , important .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
A :  No , I 'm saying , i i e I thought you were saying that stress doesn't help you distinguish between words .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , I see what you 're saying .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  As long as you get The sequence ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  So where it could help is maybe at a higher level .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  Understanding ,

dialogue type : b
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Exactly .

dialogue type : h
A :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^no
A :  well I don't know .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  We d we sort of didn't get that far .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , we just talked about some possible features that could be marked by humans

dialogue type : fh
A :  and , um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  because of having maybe some extra transcriber time we thought we could go through and mark some portion of the data for that .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  right .

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'm definitely interested in this area , too ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  f uh , acoustic feature stuff .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  That could help though .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^m^rt
A :  That 's what the head 's for ?

dialogue type : qy^2^d^rt
A :  To separate the ears ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Actually the , um For some reason the digit forms are blank .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Uh , I think th that may be due to the fact that Adam ran out of digits , uh , and didn't have time to regenerate any .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^j.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Uh , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
A :  I do need your names and and the time , and all that ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  cuz we put that into the " key " files .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : %--
A :  But w

dialogue type : s^df
A :  That 's why we have the forms ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  uh , even if there are no digits .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I guess we 're we 're done .
