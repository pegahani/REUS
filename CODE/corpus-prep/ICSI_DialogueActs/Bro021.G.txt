dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Uh , OK .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , in my lunch talk last week I I said I 'd tried phase normalization and gotten garbage results using that l um , long - term mean subtraction approach .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  It turned out there was a bug in my Matlab code .

dialogue type : s
G :  So I tried it again ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  um ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  and , um , the results were were better .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  I got intelligible speech back .

dialogue type : s
G :  But they still weren't as good as just subtracting the magnitude the log magnitude means .

dialogue type : s
G :  And also I 've been talking to , um , Andreas and Thilo about the , um , SmartKom language model

dialogue type : s
G :  and about coming up with a good model for , um , far mike use of the SmartKom system .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So

dialogue type : s^cc
G : 

dialogue type : s^bsc
G :  for the SmartKom system , I mean .

dialogue type : fh
G :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  one of the experiments we 're gonna do is , um , we 're gonna , um , train the a Broadcast News net ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  which is because that 's what we 've been using so far ,

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  and , um , adapt it on some other data . Um , An - Andreas wants to use ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  um ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  data that resembles read speech ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  like these digit readings ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because he feels that the SmartKom system interaction is not gonna be exactly conversational .

dialogue type : qw
G :  S so actually I was wondering , how long does it take to train that Broadcast News net ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
G :  Two , three weeks .

dialogue type : b
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
G :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So I did two experiments ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So , phases get added , modulo two pi ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  and because you only know the phase of the complex number t t to a value modulo two pi .

dialogue type : s
G :  And so I thought at first , um , that , uh , what I should do is unwrap the phase

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because that will undo that .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  Um , but I actually got worse results doing that unwrapping using the simple phase unwrapper that 's in Matlab than I did not unwrapping at all .

dialogue type : s
G :  And that 's all I have to say .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .
