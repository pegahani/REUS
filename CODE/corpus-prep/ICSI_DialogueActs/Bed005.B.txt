dialogue type : s^bk|s^co
B :  OK . Ami , do yours

dialogue type : s
B :  then we 'll open it

dialogue type : s
B :  and I think it 'll be enough .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  So , we all switched on ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : fg|s^t
B :  Anyway . So , uh , before we get started with the , uh , technical part , I just want to review what I think is happening with the our data collection .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  So Uh , probably after today , that shouldn't come up in this meeting .

dialogue type : s
B :  Th - this this is s should be im it isn't There 's another thing going on of gathering data ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and that 's pretty much independent of this .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , uh , I just want to make sure we 're all together on this .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  What we think is gonna happen is that , uh , in parallel starting about now we 're gonna get Fey to , where you 're working with me and Robert , draft a note that we 're gonna send out to various CogSci c and other classes saying , " here 's an opportunity to be a subject .

dialogue type : s^e:s
B :  Contact Fey . "

dialogue type : s
B :  And then there 'll be a certain number of um , hours during the week which she will be available

dialogue type : s
B :  and we 'll bring in people .

dialogue type : qw
B :  Uh , roughly how many , Robert ?

dialogue type : qy^e
B :  We d Do we know ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  OK . So , we 're looking for a total of fifty people ,

dialogue type : s
B :  not necessarily by any means all students

dialogue type : s
B :  but we 'll s we 'll start with with that .

dialogue type : s
B :  In parallel with that , we 're gonna need to actually do the script .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , so , I guess there 's a plan to have a meeting Friday afternoon Uh , with uh , Jane , and maybe Liz and whoever , on actually getting the script worked out .

dialogue type : s
B :  But what I 'd like to do , if it 's O K , is to s to , as I say , start the recruiting in parallel and possibly start running subjects next week .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  The week after that 's Spring Break ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and maybe we 'll look for them some subjects next door

dialogue type : %-
B :  or i

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
B :  Oh , OK , then we won't do it .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that 's easy .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  So , is Is that make sense to everybody ?

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's a good idea .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba^r
B :  Oh , yeah . The high school 's a great idea .

dialogue type : qh^cs
B :  And why don't you also copy Jane on it ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , th I think they 're necessary .

dialogue type : s
B :  This The permission form .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , there has to be one ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and I think we 're just gonna use it as it is ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and Um

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Well , yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  There 's one tricky part about ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  they have the right

dialogue type : fh
B :  um

dialogue type : s:s
B :  I The last paragraph " if you agree to participate you have the opportunity to have anything excised which you would prefer not to have included in the data set . "

dialogue type : s^f
B :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Now that , we had to be included for this other

dialogue type : s
B :  which might have , uh , meetings , you know , about something .

dialogue type : s
B :  In this case , it doesn't really make sense .

dialogue type : fh|s:s
B :  Um , so what I 'd like to do is also have our subjects sign a waiver saying " I don't want to see the final transcript " .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  And if they don't If they say " no , I 'm not willing to sign that " , then we 'll show them the final transcript .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But , um .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  yeah , so we might actually ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um

dialogue type : s:s
B :  S i Jane may say that , " you know , you can't do this " ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , " on the same form , we need a separate form . "

dialogue type : s:s
B :  But anyway . I 'd I 'd I 'd like to , e e um , add an a little thi eh a thing for them to initial , saying " nah , do I don't want to see the final transcript . "

dialogue type : s
B :  But other than that , that 's one 's been approved ,

dialogue type : s
B :  this really is the same project ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  uh , rec

dialogue type : fh
B :  you know .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so forth .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So I think we just go with it .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^2^ba
B :  Which is not a lot .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yeah , we can show us ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  right ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  So , you can sho You you Are are you gonna show us the little templates ?

dialogue type : s^ba.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar|%-
B :  No i

dialogue type : %-
B :  Well

dialogue type : s
B :  Actually , it 's a little tricky , in that there 's some allowable German orders which aren't allowable English orders and so forth .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  And it is order - based .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Isn't it ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
B :  Oh . So it it doe I it These u these optional elements ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
B :  it 's it 's actually a set ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  not a sequence ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh !

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  Really a se

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
B :  Oh , wow .

dialogue type : qy^t1
B :  Do I ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Capitalized as well

dialogue type : %-
B :  Y i

dialogue type : %--
B :  p

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bu^rt:s
B :  So so , the point is , if it says " this " and " see " , it also will work in " see " and " this " ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  In the other order ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  with those two key words ?

dialogue type : s
B :  " This is the one I want to see "

dialogue type : s^e
B :  or whatever .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  OK , so it is set - based .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  No , no .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Fine .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah , flexible it is .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : %-
B :  So

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 'd be great .

dialogue type : s
B :  It would be a good exercise to just see whether one can get that to run .

dialogue type : qw^br
B :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : %--
B :  y

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah . They also seem to affect state ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  there were other actions uh , that that s seemed to step state variables somewhere ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  like the n s " Discourse Status Confirm " .

dialogue type : s
B :  OK . So that 's going to be a call on the discourse

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I think that 's right .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think it 's actually That looks like it 's state modification .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qy.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Well , go back , then ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz it may be that all those th things , while they look like function calls , are just a way of adding exactly that to the XML .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Uh - huh !

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I 'm not I 'm not sure .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Good point .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  It 's it 's the It 's under what sub - type you 're doing it .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  S so that 's funny .

dialogue type : s
B :  You bury the s the state in the function

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  " I want two seats here . "

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  No , right , the Discourse Maintainer ,

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : s
B :  And it and it runs around looking for Discourse Status tags ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and doing whatever it does with them .

dialogue type : s
B :  And other people ignore those tags .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  So , yeah . I definitely think it 's It 's worth the exercise of trying to actually add something that isn't there .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh

dialogue type : %-
B :  Disc

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  Yeah , a kid understanding what 's going on .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
B :  Then the next thing we talked about is actually , um , figuring out how to add our own tags , and stuff like that .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : %--
B :  S

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So these are these are your friends back at EML .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So this is not a complicated negotiation .

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
B :  There 's there 's not seven committees , or anything , right ?

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Great .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's a design thing , not a political thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  Once we 've eh We can just sort of agree on what oughta be done .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Good .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^ba
B :  So , well , let Now , this is important .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Let , uh I want a a Again , outside of m almost managerial point ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  You 're in the midst of this ,

dialogue type : s^df^e
B :  so you know better .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  But it seems to me it 's probably a good idea to li uh minimize the number of uh , change requests we make of them .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So it seemed to me , what we ought to do is get our story together .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  OK ?

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  And think about it some , internally , before asking them to make changes .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : qy
B :  Does this does this make sense to you guys ?

dialogue type : s^bd
B :  It I mean you 're you 're doing the the interaction

dialogue type : s^cs^df.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  And I I don't know who 's mok working most closely on it .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Probably Johno .

dialogue type : s^f
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , take what they have ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  send it to everybody saying " this is what they have ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  this is what we think we should add " ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  OK ?

dialogue type : s.%--:s.%--
B :  and then have a d a an iteration within our group saying " Hmm , well "

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And get our best idea of what we should add .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then go back to them .

dialogue type : %--
B :  Is i

dialogue type : s^bd^no
B :  or , I don't know

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  does this make sense to you ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B :  Or

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  That 's right .

dialogue type : fg
B :  So .

dialogue type : fg
B :  So , Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  The problem isn't the short ra range optimization .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's the sort of o one or two year kind of thing .

dialogue type : s^f|qh
B :  OK . What are the thl class of things we think we might try to do in a year or two ?

dialogue type : qh
B :  How how would we try to characterize those

dialogue type : qw
B :  and what do we want to request now that 's leave enough space to do all that stuff ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  And that re that requires some thought .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so that sounds like a great thing to do as the priority item

dialogue type : s^e
B :  um , as soon as we can do it .

dialogue type : s
B :  So y so you guys will send to the rest of us um a version of um , this ,

dialogue type : s^e
B : 

dialogue type : %--
B :  Well b

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  So , the the uh Not everyone uh , reads German ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  so if you 'd

dialogue type : fh
B :  um

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  tu uh , tur change the description to , uh , English

dialogue type : fh
B :  and , um ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  Then then ,

dialogue type : fh|qh^cs
B :  yeah . Then , with some sug s suggestions about where where do we go from here ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , this and this , of course , was just the action end .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , at some point we 're going to have to worry about the language end .

dialogue type : s
B :  But for the moment just uh , t for this class of of things , we might want to try to encompass .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Oh , yeah , yeah yeah yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  This is this is everything that that , um , you know , um we might want to do in the next couple years .

dialogue type : s
B :  We don't I mean , that 's an issue .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  We don't know what , entirely .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Oh . It 's beyond Source - Path - Goal ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but I think we don't need to get beyond it @ @ tourists in Heidelberg .

dialogue type : s
B :  It seems to me we can get all the complexity we want in actions and in language without going outside of tourists in Heidelberg .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
B :  But you know , i depending on what people are interested in , one could have , uh , tours ,

dialogue type : s
B :  one could have um , explanations of why something is is , you know , why why was this done ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , no there 's no end

dialogue type : s^e
B :  to the complexity you can build into the uh , what a tourist in Heidelberg might ask .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So , at least unless somebody else wants t to suggest otherwise I think the general domain we don't have t to uh , broaden .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  That is , tourists in Heidelberg .

dialogue type : s
B :  And if there 's something somebody comes up with that can't be done that way , then , sure .

dialogue type : s
B :  W we 'll we 'll look at that ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but uh

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^ba^cs
B :  I mean if if you want to uh , push us into reference problems , that would be great .

dialogue type : s
B :  OK , so this is his specialty is reference ,

dialogue type : qh^e
B :  and you know , what what are these things referring to ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Not only anaphora ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but , uh , more generally the , uh this whole issue of , uh , referring expressions ,

dialogue type : qh
B :  and , what is it that they 're actually dealing with in the world ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And , again , this is li in the databa this is also pretty well formed

dialogue type : s
B :  because there is an ontology ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and the database , and stuff .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it isn't like , um , you know , the Evening Star or stuff like that .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  All the entities do have concrete reference .

dialogue type : s
B :  Although th the To get at them from a language may not be trivial .

dialogue type : s
B :  There aren't really deep mysteries about um , what w what things the system knows about .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  All those things .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  You have proper names , and descriptions .

dialogue type : s
B :  And a l and a lot and and anaphora , and pronouns ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and all those things .

dialogue type : s
B :  He knows .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Or , you know , the church across from City Hall ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba
B :  Yeah , that would be fine .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  Or you can say " how " you know , " how do I get back ? "

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , again , it 's just a question of which of these things , uh , people want to dive into .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  What , uh , I think I 'm gonna try to do ,

dialogue type : s:s^fe
B :  and I guess , pwww !

dialogue type : s
B :  let 's say that by the end of spring break , I 'll try to come up with some general story about , um , construction grammar ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and what constructions we 'd use

dialogue type : s
B :  and how all this might fit together .

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's this whole framework problem that I 'm feeling really uncomfortable about .

dialogue type : s
B :  And I haven't had a chance to think about it seriously .

dialogue type : s
B :  But I I want to I want to do that early , rather than late .

dialogue type : s
B :  And you and I will probably have to talk about this some .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Oh , yeah ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Well , I mean

dialogue type : s^aa|%-
B :  yeah , I d

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  You will .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I mean , uh , we could take all the standard metaphor examples and make question versions of them .

dialogue type : s^f
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs:qw
B :  Yeah , or , you know . " Wh - why is he why is he pushing for promotion ? "

dialogue type : s.%--:qw.%--
B :  or , " who 's pushing proof "

dialogue type : s
B :  er , just pick pick any of them

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So I don't I don't think , uh , it 's at all difficult Uh , to convert them to question forms that really exist and people say all the time ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  And sort of we don't know how to handle them , too .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  We don't know how to handle the declarative forms , @ @ really ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  and , then , the interrogative forms , ah - oh .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  Nancy , it looked like you were s

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Right . No , I think that 's one of things that 's interesting ,

dialogue type : s
B :  is is in this sort of over - arching story we we worked it out for th as you say , this the storytelling scenario .

dialogue type : s
B :  And I think it 's really worth thinking through what it looks like .

dialogue type : qh^e
B :  What is the simspec mean , et cetera .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  Well , I don't know .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I mean , maybe maybe that 's what we 'll do is is s u e

dialogue type : s
B :  We can do anything we want with it .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I mean , once we have fulfilled these requirements ,

dialogue type : s^f|s
B :  OK , and the one for next uh , summer is just half done

dialogue type : s
B :  and then the other half is this , um , " generation thing " which we think isn't much different .

dialogue type : s
B :  So once that 's done , then all the rest of it is , uh , sort of , you know , what we want to do for the research .

dialogue type : s
B :  And we can w we can do all sorts of things that don't fit into their framework at all .

dialogue type : s
B :  Th - there 's no reason why we 're c we 're constrained to do that .

dialogue type : s
B :  If we can use all the , uh , execution engines , then we can , you know , really try things that would be too too much pain to do ourselves .

dialogue type : s
B :  But there 's no obligation on any of this .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , if we want to turn it into u understan standing stories about Heidelberg , we can do that .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^am|s^aa
B :  You might , yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Anyway .

dialogue type : %-
B :  S

dialogue type : qw^t3
B :  Who 's going ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Ah !

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So eh Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So , what happened is ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Robert was describing

dialogue type : s
B :  the There 's two packages

dialogue type : s
B :  there 's a , uh , quote parser ,

dialogue type : s
B :  there 's a particular piece of this big system ,

dialogue type : s
B :  which , in German , uh , takes these t sentence templates and produces XML structures .

dialogue type : s
B :  And one of our jobs was to make the English equivalent of that .

dialogue type : s
B :  That , these guys did in a in a day .

dialogue type : s
B :  The other thing is , at the other end , roughly at the same level , there 's something that takes , uh , X M L structures , produces an output XML structure

dialogue type : s
B :  which is instructions for the generator .

dialogue type : s^f
B :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And then there 's a language generator ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then after that a s a synthesizer that goes from an XML structure to , uh , language generation , to actual specifications for a synthesizer .

dialogue type : s
B :  Eh , but again , there 's one module in which there 's one piece that we have to convert to English .

dialogue type : qy.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  And that But as I say , this is all along was viewed as a kind of a m a minor thing ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And much more interesting is the fact that , as part of doing this , we we are , you know , inheriting this system that does all sort of these other things .

dialogue type : s
B :  Not precisely what we want ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and that 's that 's wh where it it gets difficult .

dialogue type : s
B :  And I I don't pretend to understand yet what I think we really ought to do .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba|s^bk
B :  Good ! OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Good .

dialogue type : qw
B :  And what 's the other one ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  so that just we know what the d agenda is ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I 've got a couple new Wu papers as well .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , so I I 've been in contact with Wu ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so , probably let 's put that off till I I till I understand better , uh , what he 's doing .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's just a little embarrassing

dialogue type : s
B :  cause all this was in his thesis

dialogue type : s
B :  and I was on his thesis committee ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and , so , I r really knew this at one time .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , I I It 's not only uh Is Part of what I haven't figured out yet is is how all this goes together .

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  So I 'll dig up some more stuff from Dekai .

dialogue type : qh^cs.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%
B :  squealing sound ?

dialogue type : s^am
B :  It 's probably just as easy .

dialogue type : %--
B :  I

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's why they invented " pocket T 's " .

dialogue type : s^co.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So , this is the Heckerman paper you 're working with ?

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Good .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Well . OK , so th so the important point is W not what the G function is .

dialogue type : s
B :  The important point is that Um There is a a a general kind of idea of shortcutting the full CPT .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Th - c the full conditional probability table with some function .

dialogue type : s^f
B :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Which y w you choose appropriately for each case .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , depending on what your situation is , there are different functions which are most appropriate .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So I gave eh Bhaskara a copy of this , eh sort of " ninety - two " paper .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  D and you got one , Robert .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't know who else has seen it .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  It 's short .

dialogue type : s^m^na
B :  It 's short .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  So , I u w Um , yo uh you Have you read it yet ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
B :  OK , so you should take a look .

dialogue type : s
B :  Nancy , I 'm sure you read it at some point in life .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s^ba
B :  Anyway . So the paper isn't th isn't real hard .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : qw
B :  One of the questions just come at Bhaskara is , " How much of this does JavaBayes support ? "

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--:s
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  One thing you could do , which is kind of s in a way , stupid , is take this deterministic function , and use it to build the CPT .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , if Ba - JavaBayes won't do it for you ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  that you can convert all that into what the CPT would be .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um and , what I sent out about a week ago , was an idea of how to do that , for , um , evidence combination .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So one of one function that you could use as your " G function " is an e e Evidence - Combining .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So you just take the uh , if each of th if each of the ones has its own little table like that , then you could take the , uh , strength of each of those , times its little table ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  and you 'd add up the total evidence for " V " , " E " , and " A " .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : %--
B :  I i i

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%--
B :  No , no But I 'm saying is There There is a w

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , if y if if you decide what 's what is appropriate , is probablistic evidence combination , you can write a function that does it .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  It 's a pui it 's actually one of the examples he 's got in there .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : qy
B :  now is it clear that you might like to be able to shortcut the whole conditional probability table .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : qh
B :  That 's one of the problems , is , W Is is , Where would th Where would it all come from ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yeah , so there 's there 's two separate things , Robert .

dialogue type : s
B :  The f the the the Bayes - nets in general are quite good at saying , " if you have no current information about this variable just take the prior for that . "

dialogue type : s^f|s
B :  OK ? Th - that 's what they 're real good at .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  eh , basically whatever w it 's Probabilistically , whatever it would be .

dialogue type : s
B :  And it 's it 's sort of not a great estimate ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but it 's the best one you have ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and , so forth .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that , they 're good at .

dialogue type : qh
B :  But the other problem is , how do you fill in all these numbers ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And I think that 's the one he was getting at .

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  Well , pretty quickly .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Eh well to some

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No , no .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  So , " Noisy - OR " is a funny way of referring to this ,

dialogue type : s^df:s
B :  because the Noisy - OR is only one instance .

dialogue type : s^na:s
B :  That one actually isn't a Noisy - OR .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  So we 'll have to think of of a way t t

dialogue type : s^aa|s^bd
B :  Yeah , whatever .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So Eh Um

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  Yeah , it it Tha - that 's true .

dialogue type : s
B :  It is a is also more neural - net - like , although Uh , it isn't necessarily sum uh , s you know , sum of weights or anything like that .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I mean i You could have ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  uh , like the Noisy - OR function , really is one that 's essentially says , uh , take the max .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Same .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh

dialogue type : fg
B :  But anyway .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And , I thi I think that 's the standard way people get around the uh

dialogue type : s
B :  There are a couple other ones .

dialogue type : s
B :  There are ways of breaking this up into s to to subnets and stuff like that .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But , um

dialogue type : %--
B :  The

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  I think we definitely I think it 's a great idea tha to to pursue that .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  No .

dialogue type : fg|%--
B :  So , i is

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , let me say something , guys ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz there 's not There 's a pretty point about this we might as well get in right now .

dialogue type : s
B :  Which is The hierarchy that s comes with the ontology is just what you want for this .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that Uh , if you know about it let 's say , a particular town hall that , it 's one that is a monument , then , that would be stored there .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  If you don't , you look up the hierarchy ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  Eh so , you you you may or So , then you 'd have this little vector of , um , you know , Approach Mode or EVA Mode .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  Let 's OK , so we have the EVA vector for for various kinds of landmarks .

dialogue type : s
B :  If you know it for a specific landmark you put it there .

dialogue type : s
B :  If you don't , you just go up the hierarchy to the first place you find one .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : s:s
B : 

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  but but in any case i View it logically as being in the ontology .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  It 's part of what you know about a an object , is its EVA vector .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , if yo As I say , if you know about a specific object , you put it there .

dialogue type : s
B :  This is part of what Dekai was doing .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , when we get to Wu , The - e We 'll see w what he says about that .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , then if you If it isn't there , it 's higher ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and if you don't know anything except that it 's a b it 's it 's a building , then up at the highest thing , you have the pr what amounts to a prior .

dialogue type : s
B :  If you don't know anything else about a building , uh , you just take whatever your crude approximation is up at that level ,

dialogue type : s
B :  which might be equal , or whatever it is .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , that 's a very pretty relationship between these local vectors and the ontology .

dialogue type : s
B :  And it seems to me the obvious thing to do , unless we find a reason to do something different .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Does this make sense to you ?

dialogue type : %-
B :  Bhask - ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Indeed .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  We 're gonna need some way to either get a p tag in the ontology , or add fields ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Th - the th you know , there 's always a way to do that .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B :  i

dialogue type : %-
B :  th

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B :  e

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
B :  And , so ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  i

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qh^df
B :  Well , they they they How ar What are they gonna do with instances ?

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  I mean , you y

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qw^df
B :  But what i What is SmartKom gonna do about that ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Cuz , they have instances all the time .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  But Uh uh SmartKom 's gonna need an ontology .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^df
B :  I understand , but is anybody doing anything about it ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's a political problem .

dialogue type : s
B :  We won't worry about it .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  This is with the whole thing ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  we may have to build another data stru

dialogue type : s
B :  Conceptually , we know what should be done .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  When we see what people have done , it may turn out that the easiest thing to do is to build a a separate thing that that just pools i i

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  w That we have to build our own instance , uh , things , that , with their types ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then it goes off to the ontology once you have its type .

dialogue type : s
B :  So we build a little data structure

dialogue type : s
B :  And so what we would do in that case , is , in our instance gadget have our E V

dialogue type : s
B :  And if we d there isn't one we 'd get the type

dialogue type : s
B :  and then have the E V As for the type .

dialogue type : s
B :  So we 'd have our own little , uh , EVA tree .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then , for other , uh , vectors that we need .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , we 'd have our own little things so that whenever we needed one , we 'd just use the ontology to get the type ,

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  and then would hash or whatever we do to say , " ah !

dialogue type : s:s^fe
B :  If it 's that type of thing , and we want its EVA vector , pppt - pppt ! it 's that . "

dialogue type : s
B :  So , I I think we can handle that .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then But , the combination functions , and whether we can put those in Java Bayes , and all that sort of stuff , is , uh is the bigger deal .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think that 's where we have to get technically clever .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba
B :  Yeah , I mean , it 's , uh , e e e e e cute .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  Just ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I mean , there 's this huge package which which may or may not be consistent

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^f
B :  you know .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs
B :  But , yeah , we could look at it .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  The thing is , it 's kind of an interpreter

dialogue type : s
B :  and i i it expects its data structures to be in a given form ,

dialogue type : s.%-:s
B :  and if you say , " hey , we 're gonna make a different kind of data structure to stick in there "

dialogue type : s
B :  It may or may not .

dialogue type : s^no^rt
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : qh
B :  That 's the question is " to what extent does it allow us to put in these G functions ? "

dialogue type : s^no
B :  And I don't know .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
B :  Yeah , that 's fine

dialogue type : s^df
B :  if it 's if it comes only at the end .

dialogue type : qh
B :  But suppose you want it embedded ?

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
B :  Yeah , that 's a truly horrible way to do d it .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^na
B :  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , you bet .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  But , at that point you may say , " hey , Java Bayes isn't the only package in town .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  Let 's see if there 's another package that 's , eh , more civilized about this . "

dialogue type : s
B :  Now , Srini is worth talking to on this ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz he said that he actually did hack some combining functions into

dialogue type : s
B :  But he doesn't remember at least when I talked to him , he didn't remember whether it was an e an easy thing , a natural thing , or whether he had to do some violence to it to make it work .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  But he did do it .

dialogue type : s^na
B : 

dialogue type : s^bd
B :  It 's blown up ,

dialogue type : s^bd
B :  and is a it 's , uh it 's huge ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but it doesn't require any data fitting or complication .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I I understand .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B :  I 'm just saying tha that w

dialogue type : s
B :  That was wi that was my note .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  The little note I sent said that .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  It said , " Here 's the way you 'd take the logical f G function and turn it into a CPT . "

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean that the Max - the Evidence - Combining function .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So we could do that .

dialogue type : s^am^cs
B :  And maybe that 's what we 'll do .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But , um

dialogue type : s^no
B :  don't know .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So , I will , e e before next week , uh , @ @ p push push some more on on this stuff that Dekai Wu did ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and try to understand it .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  Uh , you 'll make a couple of more copies of the Heckerman paper to give to people ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Well , you and I should talk about it .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
B :  Alright , great !

dialogue type : s^ft.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  He he 's been sick ,

dialogue type : s^e
