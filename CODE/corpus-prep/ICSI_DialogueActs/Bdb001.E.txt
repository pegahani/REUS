dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
E :  Are you talking about the overlap a annotations ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  So what I was imagining was um , so Dave says we can have unlimited numbers of green ribbons .

dialogue type : s
E :  And so put , uh , a a green ribbon on for an overlap code .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  I I think it 's important to remain flexible regarding the time bins for now .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  However , you know , you want to have it , uh , time time uh , located in the discourse .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  if we if we tie the overlap code to the first word in the overlap , then you 'll have a time - marking .

dialogue type : s
E :  It won't it 'll be independent of the time bins ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  however these e evolve , shrink , or whatever ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  increase ,

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  Also , you could have different time bins for different purposes .

dialogue type : s
E :  And having it tied to the first word in an overlap segment is unique , uh , you know , anchored , clear .

dialogue type : s
E :  And it would just end up on a separate ribbon .

dialogue type : s
E :  So the overlap coding is gonna be easy with respect to that .

dialogue type : s
E :  You look puzzled .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  What , the codes themselves ?

dialogue type : qrr.%-
E :  Or the ?

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , we don't have to go into the codes .

dialogue type : s^r
E :  We don't have to go into the codes .

dialogue type : s^co.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No .

dialogue type : s^bs
E :  W the idea is just to have a separate green ribbon ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  you know ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and and and let 's say that this is a time bin .

dialogue type : s
E :  There 's a word here .

dialogue type : s
E :  This is the first word of an overlapping segment of any length ,

dialogue type : s
E :  overlapping with any other , uh , word uh , i segment of any length .

dialogue type : fh
E :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  then you can indicate that this here was perhaps a ch a backchannel ,

dialogue type : s
E :  or you can say that it was , um , a usurping of the turn ,

dialogue type : s
E :  or you can you know , any any number of categories .

dialogue type : s
E :  But the fact is , you have it time - tagged in a way that 's independent of the , uh , sp particular time bin that the word ends up in .

dialogue type : s^e.%--
E :  If it 's a large unit or a small unit , or

dialogue type : s
E :  we sh change the boundaries of the units ,

dialogue type : s
E :  it 's still unique and and , uh , fits with the format ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  flexible , all that .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : qy
E :  Is it S - diff ?

dialogue type : b.%
E :  Mmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  Well , can I ask one question ?

dialogue type : s
E :  It it seems to me that , um , we will have o an official version of the corpus , which will be only one one version in terms of the words where the words are concerned .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : %
E : 

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  I agree .

dialogue type : s
E :  That was what I was wondering .

dialogue type : s
E :  Time is unique .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fh
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %
E :  Ach !

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : qy
E :  But then couldn't you just indirectly figure out the time tied to the word ?

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : fh
E :  Well ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but you 'd have some anchoring point .

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  He couldn't have changed all the words .

dialogue type : b.%
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  But it could be that they just uh , I mean , it could be that they chunked they they lost certain utterances and all that stuff ,

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 's interesting .

dialogue type : z
E :  O three
