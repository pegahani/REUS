dialogue type : s
B :  So ne next week we 'll have , uh , both Birger and , uh , Mike

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Michael Kleinschmidt

dialogue type : s
B :  and Birger Kollmeier will join us .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  and you 're you 're probably gonna go up in a couple three weeks or so ?

dialogue type : qw^e
B :  When d when are you thinking of going up to , uh , OGI ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba|s
B :  Good . So at least we 'll have one meeting with yo with you still around ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's good .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d|qy^d^g
B :  All today , huh ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^ar|qy^bu^d^rt
B :  No , this I 'm sorry , this is a conference call between different Aurora people

dialogue type : qrr.%-
B :  or just ?

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's the main conference call .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qw
B :  And what are we sitting at currently ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu^m
B :  Two thirty .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  we have to reduce it by ten milliseconds somehow .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  W It 's it 's p d primary primarily determined by the VAD at this point ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  S so we can make the VAD a little shorter .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Yeah . We probably should do that pretty soon so that we don't get used to it being a certain way .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy
B :  Was Hari on the on the phone ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : x
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk.%
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Uh , but th the two th two thirty includes the tandem network ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy
B :  And i is the tandem network , uh , small enough that it will fit on the terminal size

dialogue type : s^e.%-
B :  in terms of ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : qw.%-
B :  Ho - how much memory d ? H how many ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^na
B :  Yeah . I 'd like to see that ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz maybe I could think a little bit about it ,

dialogue type : s^am^cs
B :  cuz we maybe we could make it a little smaller

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  or I mean , it 'd be it 'd be neat if we could fit it all .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , I 'd like to see how far off we are .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  But I guess it 's still within their rules to have have it on the , uh , t uh , server side .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d.%--
B :  And this is still ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Uh , well , y you 're saying here .

dialogue type : s
B :  I c I should just let you go on .

dialogue type : b
B :  Huh .

dialogue type : qy.%--
B :  Could ? Uh , uh ,

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  I 'm I 'm really sorry .

dialogue type : qy
B :  Can you repeat what you were saying about the silence probability ?

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^df.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d.%-
B :  The VAD network is ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa|%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^ba.%
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qh^d^rt
B :  We don't ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , you know , in a way what it might i it 's it 's a little bit like combining knowledge sources .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because the fact that you have these two nets that are different sizes means they behave a little differently ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  they find different things .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  if you have , um f the distribution that you have from , uh , f speech sounds is w sort of one source of knowledge .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  and rather than just taking one minus that to get the other ,

dialogue type : s
B :  which is essentially what 's happening ,

dialogue type : s
B :  you have this other source of knowledge that you 're putting in there .

dialogue type : s
B :  So you make use of both of them in in what you 're ending up with .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Maybe it 's better .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
B :  Anyway , you can probably justify anything if what 's use

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh !

dialogue type : s
B :  That might be the key , actually .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Cuz you were really thinking about speech versus nonspeech for that .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's a good point .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , back on the second stream ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , that 's something we 've talked about for a while .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , I think that 's certainly a high hope .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  so we have this this default idea about just using some sort of purely spectral thing ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  for a second stream ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  But , uh , how was the stream combined ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
B :  Right . So , I mean , if you just had a second stream that was just spectral and had another neural net and combined there , that that , uh , might be good .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
B :  Yeah . Maybe you just put in some other noise ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  something that 's different .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , it it 's probably helpful to have have a little noise there .

dialogue type : s
B :  But it may be something else

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  th at least you could say it was .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then if it doesn't hurt too much , though .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Yeah . That 's a good idea .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So this is a particular human .

dialogue type : s^bu^e
B :  This is this i this is Stephane .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's two problems there .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean I mean , so so the first is that by doing LPC - twelve with synthesized speech w like you 're saying , uh , it 's i i you 're you 're adding other degradation .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  So it 's not just the noise

dialogue type : s^e
B :  but you 're adding in fact some degradation

dialogue type : s^df^e
B :  because it 's only an approximation .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and the second thing is which is m maybe more interesting is that , um , if you do it with whispered speech , you get this number .

dialogue type : qh^cs
B :  What if you had done analysis re - synthesis and taken the pitch as well ?

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Alright ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So now you put the pitch in .

dialogue type : qh
B :  What would the percentage be then ?

dialogue type : s
B :  See , that 's the question .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , you see , if it 's if it 's if it 's , uh Let 's say it 's back down to one percent again .

dialogue type : s
B :  That would say at least for people , having the pitch is really , really important ,

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  which would be interesting in itself .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s:s^ba
B :  if i on the other hand , if it stayed up near five percent , then I 'd say " boy , LPC n twelve is pretty crummy " .

dialogue type : qy^d^f
B :  You know ?

dialogue type : s^no
B :  So I I I 'm not sure I 'm not sure how we can conclude from this anything about that our system is close to the human performance .

dialogue type : s^nd.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qh.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qh^cs
B :  What if you did LPC - twenty ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Twenty .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  I mean , th the thing is LPC is not a a really great representation of speech .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , all I 'm saying is that you have in addition to the w the , uh , removal of pitch , you also are doing , uh , a particular parameterization ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  which ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  Uh , so , let 's see ,

dialogue type : qw^t1.%-
B :  how would you do ? So , fo

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
B :  No . Actually , we d we we don't ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because we do we do , uh , uh , mel filter bank , for instance .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bd^no
B :  Um , I don't know what mel , uh , based synthesis would sound like ,

dialogue type : s^df^ng
B :  but certainly the spectra are quite different .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yeah , it 's one percent .

dialogue type : s
B :  He 's trying to remove the pitch information

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and make it closer to what to what we 're seeing as the feature vectors .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean We were we were j It it it 's a little bit still apples and oranges

dialogue type : s
B :  because we are choosing these features in order to be the best for recognition .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  i if you listen to them they still might not be very Even if you made something closer to what we 're gonna i it might not sound very good .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , and i the degradation from that might might actually make it even harder , uh , to understand than the LPC - twelve .

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  So all I 'm saying is that the LPC - twelve puts in synthesis

dialogue type : s^e
B :  puts in some degradation

dialogue type : s
B :  that 's not what we 're used to hearing ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's not it 's not just a question of how much information is there , as if you will always take maximum advantage of any information that 's presented to you .

dialogue type : s
B :  In fact , you hear some things better than others .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  But , I agree that it says that , uh , the kind of information that we 're feeding it is probably , um , um , a little bit , um , minimal .

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's definitely some things that we 've thrown away .

dialogue type : s
B :  And that 's why I was saying it might be interesting if you an interesting test of this would be if you if you actually put the pitch back in .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , you just extract it from the actual speech and put it back in ,

dialogue type : qh
B :  and see does that is that does that make the difference ?

dialogue type : s:s
B :  If that if that takes it down to one percent again , then you 'd say " OK , it 's it 's in fact having , um , not just the spectral envelope but also the also the the pitch that , uh , @ @ has the information that people can use , anyway . "

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa|%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's it 's one point four times , uh , to , uh , seven times the error ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  for Stephane .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^bd^no
B :  uh , but i I don't know .

dialogue type : s
B :  I do don't wanna take you away from other things .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  But that 's that 's what that 's the first thing that I would be curious about , is , you know , i i when you we

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
B : 

dialogue type : s^r
B :  L PC re - synthesis .

dialogue type : fh|s^bu
B :  So , uh and you did it with a noise source ,

dialogue type : s^bu^e
B :  rather than with with a s periodic source .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So if you actually did real re - synthesis like you do in an LPC synthesizer , where it 's unvoiced you use noise ,

dialogue type : s
B :  where it 's voiced you use , uh , periodic pulses .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bd^na
B :  Well , it might be hard to do it

dialogue type : s^df^nd
B :  but it but but the thing is that if you um , if you detect that there 's periodic s strong periodic components , then you can use a voiced voice thing .

dialogue type : fg|s^bd
B :  Yeah . I mean , it 's probably not worth your time .

dialogue type : s^df^e
B :  It 's it 's a side thing

dialogue type : s^df^e
B :  and and and there 's a lot to do .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  But I 'm I 'm just saying , at least as a thought experiment , that 's what I would wanna test .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , I wan would wanna drive it with a a a two - source system rather than a than a one - source system .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Cuz we 've talked about , like , this harmonic tunneling or other things that people have done based on pitch ,

dialogue type : s^am^cs
B :  maybe that 's really a key element .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Maybe maybe , uh , uh , without that , it 's it 's not possible to do a whole lot better than we 're doing .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  That that could be .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , other than the pitch de information , it 's hard to imagine that there 's a whole lot more in the signal that that , uh that we 're throwing away that 's important .

dialogue type : s^f|s^df
B :  Right ? I mean , we 're using a fair number of filters in the filter bank

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|%-
B :  Yeah . That look

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's that 's I mean , one one percent is sort of what I would I would figure .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I would actually think that if , you looked at people on various times of the day and different amounts of attention , you might actually get up to three or four percent error on digits .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  you know , we 're not we 're not incredibly far off .

dialogue type : s
B :  On the other hand , with any of these numbers except maybe the one percent , it 's st it 's not actually usable in a commercial system with a full telephone number or something .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba^tc
B :  Good .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt^t^tc
B :  Um , while we 're still on Aurora stuff maybe you can talk a little about the status with the , uh , Wall Street Journal things for it .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
B :  This is on clean test set ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  What kind of numbers are they getting on these on the test conditions ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s^am
B :  Yeah , that 's probably Aurora .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^ba.%--
B :  I I I don't find that surpri

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qw
B :  W what 's what 's some of the lower error rates on on on uh , some of the higher error rates on , uh , some of these w uh , uh , highly mismatched difficult conditions ?

dialogue type : qw^e.%--
B :  What 's a ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah . So twenty percent error rate on digits .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  So if you 're doing so if you 're doing ,

dialogue type : %-
B :  you know ,

dialogue type : %
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and if you 're saying sixty - thousand word recognition , getting sixty percent error on some of these noise condition not at all surprising .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
B :  It 's a bad sign when you looking at the numbers , you can't tell whether it 's accuracy or error rate .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  This is for the training ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s^df
B :  Yeah . Cuz we have to get started ,

dialogue type : s^df.%-
B :  cuz it 's cuz , uh ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
B :  Oh ! Good .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I guess the actual evaluation will be in six weeks or something .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Is that about right you think ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^m^rt
B :  Really , we don't know ?

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : %-
B :  Some

dialogue type : s
B :  I have to say , there 's uh something funny - sounding about saying that one of these big companies doesn't have enough cup compute power do that ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  so they 're having to have it done by Mississippi State .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  It just just sounds funny .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But ,

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  anyway .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qh
B :  The - there 's this question about , you know , what do you wanna scale ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Suppose y you can't adjust these word insertion penalties and so forth ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so you have to do everything at the level of the features .

dialogue type : qh
B :  What could you do ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And , uh , one thing I had suggested at an earlier time was maybe some sort of scaling ,

dialogue type : s
B :  some sort of root or or something of the , um , uh , features .

dialogue type : s
B :  But the problem with that is that isn't quite the same ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it occurred to me later ,

dialogue type : s^df.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  is because we do this strange thing that we do with the tandem system , at least in that system what you could do is take the , um , uh , values that come out of the net ,

dialogue type : s
B :  which are something like log probabilities ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and scale those .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then , uh , um then at least those things would have the right values

dialogue type : s^bsc
B :  or the right the right range .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then that goes into the rest of it and then that 's used as observations .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's it 's , um , another way to do it .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I know they 're not .

dialogue type : s^m^na
B :  I know they 're not .

dialogue type : %--
B :  But but ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  So because what we 're doing is pretty strange and complicated , we don't really know what the effect is at the other end .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  I mean , they 're not used as probabilities ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  we 're taking advantage of the fact that something like log probabilities has more of a Gaussian shape than Gaus - than probabilities ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and so we can model them better .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , in a way we 're taking advantage of the fact that they 're probabilities ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because they 're this quantity that looks kind of Gaussian when you take it 's log .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , uh , maybe maybe it would have a a reasonable effect to do that .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I d I don't know .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , I mean , I guess we still haven't had a a ruling back on this .

dialogue type : s
B :  And we may end up being in a situation where we just you know really can't change the word insertion penalty .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bd^df
B :  I mean , this this may not help us , uh , in the evaluation

dialogue type : s
B :  but it might help us in our understanding at least .

dialogue type : s
B :  We might , just run it with different insper insertion penalties ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  and show that , uh , " well , OK , not changing it , playing the rules the way you wanted , we did this . But in fact if we did that , it made a a big difference . "

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
B :  And just adjust it until it 's the best number ?

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
B :  Well , we can probably use the real thing ,

dialogue type : qy^g
B :  can't we ?

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  And then jus just , uh , use it on a reduced test set or something .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah . So I mean , I I think that that 's a reasonable thing to do

dialogue type : qh
B :  and the only question is what 's the actual knob that we use ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , uh , unfortunately , like I say , I don't know the analytic solution to this

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz what we really want to do is change the scale of the likelihoods ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  not the cha not the scale of the the observations .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : qy
B :  Do they have the same sort of mix - down sort of procedure , where they start off with a small number of some things

dialogue type : %-
B :  and ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy
B :  D Do you know what kind of tying they use ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Are they they sort of some sort of a bunch of Gaussians that they share across everything ?

dialogue type : %-
B :  Or or if it 's ?

dialogue type : s^bk.%
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^t^tc.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bd^no
B :  I I dunno if any of this is gonna come in in time to be relevant ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but , uh , we had talked about , uh , Guenter playing around , uh , uh , over in Germany

dialogue type : s
B :  and and , @ @ uh , possibly coming up with something that would , uh , uh , fit in later .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , I saw that other mail where he said that he uh , it wasn't going to work for him to do CVS .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So he just has it all sitting there .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  he might work on improving the noise estimate

dialogue type : s
B :  or on some histogram things ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  We we didn't talk about it at our meeting

dialogue type : s
B :  but I just saw the just read the paper .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  Someone , I forget the name , and and Ney , uh , about histogram equalization ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Did you see that one ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s^bd
B :  Yeah . I mean , I just read the paper .

dialogue type : s^bd^e
B :  I didn't see the poster .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Yeah . But it 's a little more it it 's a little finer ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So they had like ten quantiles

dialogue type : s
B :  and and they adjust the distribution .

dialogue type : s
B :  So you you have the distributions from the training set ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So this is just a a histogram of of the amplitudes , I guess .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  And then Um , people do this in image processing some .

dialogue type : s
B :  You have this kind of of histogram of of levels of brightness or whatever .

dialogue type : s
B :  And and and then , when you get a new new thing that you you want to adjust to be better in some way , you adjust it so that the histogram of the new data looks like the old data .

dialogue type : s
B :  You do this kind of piece - wise linear or , uh , some kind of piece - wise approximation .

dialogue type : s
B :  They did a uh one version that was piece - wise linear and another that had a power law thing between them between the points .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  they said they s they sort of see it in a way as s for the speech case as being kind of a generalization of spectral subtraction in a way ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because , you know , in spectral subtraction you 're trying to get rid of this excess energy .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , you know , it 's not supposed to be there .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh and , uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  this is sort of adjusting it for for a lot of different levels .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then they have s they have some kind of , uh , a floor or something ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so if it gets too low you don't don't do it .

dialogue type : s
B :  And they they claimed very nice results ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : h|s.%--
B :  Um , I think this i

dialogue type : s^no
B :  You know , I don't remember that .

dialogue type : qy.%-
B :  Do you remember ?

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : %
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  And I don't remember whether it was filter bank things

dialogue type : s^e
B :  or whether it was FFT bins

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^no.%
B :  I don't remember that .

dialogue type : s^2^na|s^aa
B :  And how often they you 've seen them . Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So you don't have to change the training .

dialogue type : s
B :  You just do a measurement over the training .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then , uh , for testing , uh , you can do it for one per utterance .

dialogue type : s
B :  Even relatively short utterances .

dialogue type : s
B :  And they claim it it works pretty well .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  I guess in pri

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  In principle .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
B :  I didn't read carefully how they actually implemented it ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  whether it was some , uh , on - line thing , or whether it was a second pass , or what .

dialogue type : s
B :  But but they That that was sort of the idea .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that that seemed , you know , different .

dialogue type : qh
B :  We 're sort of curious about , uh , what are some things that are , u u um , @ @ conceptually quite different from what we 've done .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Cuz we you know , one thing that w that ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , Stephane and Sunil seemed to find , uh , was , you know , they could actually make a unified piece of software that handled a range of different things that people were talking about ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and it was really just sort of setting of different constants .

dialogue type : s
B :  And it would turn , you know , one thing into another .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 'd turn Wiener filtering into spectral subtraction , or whatever .

dialogue type : s
B :  But there 's other things that we 're not doing .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , we 're not making any use of pitch ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , uh , which again , might might be important ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  uh , because the stuff between the harmonics is probably a schmutz .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  And and the , uh , transcribers will have fun with that .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh And , um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  the , uh , stuff at the harmonics isn't so much .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  And we there 's this overall idea of really sort of matching the the hi distributions somehow .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Uh , not just ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  not just subtracting off your estimate of the noise .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^bu^t^tc
B :  So I guess , uh , Guenter 's gonna play around with some of these things now over this next period ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , he 's got it anyway ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so he can .

dialogue type : s
B :  So potentially if he came up with something that was useful , like a diff a better noise estimation module or something , he could ship it to you guys u up there

dialogue type : fh
B :  and

dialogue type : s
B :  we could put it in .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : s^ba^tc
B :  that 's good .

dialogue type : fg|qh.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I think starting starting a w couple weeks from now , especially if you 're not gonna be around for a while , we 'll we 'll be shifting more over to some other other territory .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But , uh , uh , uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  n not not so much in this meeting about Aurora ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but but , uh ,

dialogue type : s^cs^t^tc
B :  uh , maybe just , uh , quickly today about maybe you could just say a little bit about what you 've been talking about with Michael .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs^t
B :  and then Barry can say something about what what we 're talking about .

dialogue type : b
B :  Y yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Gets thrown out .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  So i so it 's actuall

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  Well , it 's it 's much simpler .

dialogue type : s
B :  But it 's but it 's uh , it 's there 's a lot number of things I like about it , let me just say .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , first thing , well , you 're absolutely right .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , i i in truth , both pieces of this are have their analogies in stuff we already do .

dialogue type : s
B :  But it 's a different take at how to approach it

dialogue type : s
B :  and potentially one that 's m maybe a bit more systematic than what we 've done ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , and a b a bit more inspiration from from auditory things .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's so I think it 's a neat thing to try .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , essentially , it 's it 's , uh , you know , PLP or or mel cepstrum , or something like that .

dialogue type : s
B :  You 've you 've got some , uh , compression .

dialogue type : s
B :  We always have some compression .

dialogue type : s
B :  We always have some you know , the the the kind of filter bank with a kind of quasi - log scaling .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  i RASTA the filtering being done in the log domain has an AGC - like , uh , characteristic , which , you know , people typi typically put in these kind of , uh , um , uh , auditory front - ends .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's very , very similar ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , but it 's not exactly the same .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I would agree that the second one is is somewhat more different

dialogue type : s
B :  but , um , it 's mainly different in that the things that we have been doing like that have been um , had a different kind of motivation and have ended up with different kinds of constraints .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
B :  So , for instance , if you look at the LDA RASTA stuff , you know , basically what they do is they they look at the different eigenvectors out of the LDA and they form filters out of it . Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And those filters have different , uh , kinds of temporal extents and temporal characteristics .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so in fact they 're multi - scale .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , they 're not sort of systematically multi - scale , like " let 's start here and go to there , and go to there , and go to there " , and so forth .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's more like , you run it on this , you do discriminant analysis , and you find out what 's helpful .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  Yeah . They use several of them .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Uh , I mean , you don't have to

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but but but , uh , Hynek has .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Hyn - when Hynek 's had people do this kind of LDA analysis , they 've done it on frequency direction

dialogue type : s
B :  and they 've done it on the time direction .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s^e
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  and that would be the closest to these Gabor function kind of things .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , but I don't think they 've done that much of that .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And , uh , the other thing that 's interesting the the , uh the feature selection thing ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it 's a simple method ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but I kinda like it .

dialogue type : s
B :  Um , there 's a a old , old method for feature selection .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , eh , uh , I remember people referring to it as old when I was playing with it twenty years ago ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so I know it 's pretty old ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , called Stepwise Linear Discriminant Analysis

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I think it 's used in social sciences a lot .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , you you you you pick the best feature .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then you take y you find the next feature that 's the best in combination with it .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then so on and so on .

dialogue type : s
B :  And what what Michael 's describing seems to me much , much better ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because the problem with the stepwise discriminant analysis is that you don't know that you know , if you 've picked the right set of features .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Just because something 's a good feature doesn't mean that you should be adding it .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , um , uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  here at least you 're starting off with all of them ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and you 're throwing out useless features .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  I think that 's that seems , uh that seems like a lot better idea .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , you 're always looking at things in combination with other features .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so the only thing is , of course , there 's this this artificial question of of , uh , exactly how you how you a how you assess it

dialogue type : s
B :  and if if your order had been different in throwing them out .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , it still isn't necessarily really optimal ,

dialogue type : s^ba^df
B :  but it seems like a pretty good heuristic .

dialogue type : s
B :  So I th I think it 's it 's I think it 's kinda neat stuff .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And and and , uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  the thing that I wanted to to add to it also was to have us use this in a multi - stream way .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so so that , um , when you come up with these different things , and these different functions , you don't necessarily just put them all into one huge vector ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but perhaps you have some of them in one stream and some of them in another stream , and so forth .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  And we 've also talked a little bit about , uh , uh , Shihab Shamma 's stuff ,

dialogue type : s
B :  in which you the way you look at it is that there 's these different mappings

dialogue type : s
B :  and some of them emphasize , uh , upward moving , uh , energy and fre and frequency .

dialogue type : s
B :  And some are emphasizing downward

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and fast things and slow things and and so forth .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  So there 's a bunch of stuff to look at .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , uh , I think we 're sorta gonna start off with what he , uh , came here with

dialogue type : s
B :  and branch out branch out from there .

dialogue type : s
B :  And his advisor is here , too , at the same time .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : s
B :  he 'll be another interesting source of wisdom .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Or the or features .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  I mean , y actually , you make me think a a very important point here is that , um , if we a again try to look at how is this different from what we 're already doing , uh , there 's a a , uh a nasty argument that could be made th that it 's it 's not different at at all ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because , uh if you ignore the the selection part

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because we are going into a a very powerful , uh , nonlinearity

dialogue type : s
B :  that , uh , in fact is combining over time and frequency ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and is coming up with its own you know , better than Gabor functions

dialogue type : s
B :  its , you know , neural net functions ,

dialogue type : s
B :  its whatever it finds to be best .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  But I I don't actually believe that argument

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  computing features is useful ,

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  You know , uh , if you 've you 've processed it in some way you 've typically lost something some information .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And so , you 've lost information and yet it does better with with features than it does with the waveform .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , I I know that i sometimes it 's useful to to constrain things .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that 's why it really seems like the constraint in in all this stuff it 's the constraints that are actually what matters .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because if it wasn't the constraints that mattered , then we would 've completely solved this problem long ago ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because long ago we already knew how to put waveforms into powerful statistical mechanisms .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : %-
B :  Yeah

dialogue type : fg
B :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^2
B :  then it would work .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  Yeah , I agree .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yeah . There 's the problem .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yeah . Then it would work .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , uh , we we have done experiments where we literally have put waveforms in

dialogue type : fh
B :  and and and , uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  we kept the number of parameters the same and so forth ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and it used a lot of training data .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bd^df
B :  not infinite

dialogue type : s^df
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  and it it , uh it just doesn't do nearly as well .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  it 's not just having the maximum information ,

dialogue type : s
B :  you want to suppress , uh , the aspects of the input signal that are not helpful for for the discrimination you 're trying to make .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^t^tc.%--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
B :  Be - before you get on the next part l let me just point out that s there 's there 's a a pretty nice relationship between what you 're talking about doing and what you 're talking about doing there . Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So , it seems to me that , you know , if you take away the the the difference of this primary features , and , say , you use as we had talked about maybe doing you use P - RASTA - PLP or something for the the primary features , um , then this feature discovery , uh , uh , thing is just what he 's talking about doing , too ,

dialogue type : s
B :  except that he 's talking about doing them in order to discover intermediate categories that correspond to these uh , uh , what these sub - features are are are are showing you .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , um , the other difference is that , um , he 's doing this in a in a multi - band setting ,

dialogue type : s|qy^d^g^rt
B :  which means that he 's constraining himself to look across time in some f relatively limited , uh , uh , spectral extent . Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And whereas in in this case you 're saying " let 's just do it unconstrained " .

dialogue type : s
B :  So they 're they 're really pretty related

dialogue type : s
B :  and maybe they 'll be at some point where we 'll see the the connections a little better

dialogue type : s
B :  and connect them .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt
B :  Should we do our digits

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  and get ou get our treats ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yeah . It 's kind of like , you know , the little rats with the little thing dropping down to them .

dialogue type : s
B :  We do the digits and then we get our treats .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .
