dialogue type : s.%--
D :  So .

dialogue type : s
D :  Yeah , I will try to explain the thing that I did this this week during this week .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well eh you know that I work I begin to work with a new feature to detect voice - unvoice .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  What I trying two MLP to to the with this new feature and the fifteen feature uh from the eh bus base system

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%--
D :  No , satly the mes the Mel Cepstrum ,

dialogue type : s
D :  the new base system the new base system .

dialogue type : s^aa|%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  yeah the Aurora system with the new filter , VAD or something like that .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I 'm trying two MLP , one one that only have t three output ,

dialogue type : s
D :  voice , unvoice , and silence ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and other one that have fifty - six output .

dialogue type : s
D :  The probabilities of the allophone .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  And I tried to do some experiment of recognition with that

dialogue type : s
D :  and only have result with with the MLP with the three output .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I put together the fifteen features and the three MLP output .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , well , the result are li a little bit better , but more or less similar .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Voice , unvoice , and si

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  The feature the input ?

dialogue type : s
D :  The inputs are the fifteen the fifteen uh bases feature .

dialogue type : s
D :  the with the new code .

dialogue type : s
D :  And the other three features are R , the variance of the difference between the two spectrum ,

dialogue type : s
D :  the variance of the auto - correlation function , except the the first point , because half the height value is R - zero

dialogue type : s
D :  and also R - zero ,

dialogue type : s
D :  the first coefficient of the auto - correlation function .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  That is like the energy with these three feature ,

dialogue type : s
D :  also these three feature .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  No ,

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  R c No .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  Auto - correlation ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  Yes , yes , the variance of the auto - correlation function that uses that

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^m
D :  The spectral shape ,

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  No ,

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b^rt
D :  Mm - hmm ,

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Well , I can also th use this .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  Bec - because the result are a little bit better

dialogue type : s^df
D :  but we have in a point that everything is more or less the similar more or less similar .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's not quite better .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I used this too .

dialogue type : b^rt
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : fh
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar.%--
D : 

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^am
D :  Maybe .

dialogue type : s^br
D :  Ah I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^fe
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b^rt
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s
D :  Oh , not too much .

dialogue type : s
D :  Mmm , one day or less .

dialogue type : h|s^rt
D :  Eh fifty - f six

dialogue type : s^ar|qy^bu^d^rt
D :  uh no , the frame error rate ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Fifty - six I think .

dialogue type : s
D :  Percent .

dialogue type : s
D :  The accuracy .

dialogue type : s^aa.%
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ar|%--
D :  No for ,

dialogue type : s^aa^bsc|%--
D :  yes f

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  I don't remember for voice - unvoice ,

dialogue type : s
D :  maybe for the other one .

dialogue type : s
D :  for voiced .

dialogue type : s^no.%-
D :  I don't reme

dialogue type : s^aa^m
D :  Better .

dialogue type : s
D :  Maybe for voice - unvoice .

dialogue type : s
D :  This is for the other one .

dialogue type : s
D :  I should I can't show that .

dialogue type : s
D :  But I think that fifty - five was for the when the output are the fifty - six phone .

dialogue type : s
D :  That I look in the with the other nnn the other MLP that we have are more or less the same number .

dialogue type : s
D :  Silence will be better but more or less the same .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think that I I I think that for the other one , for the three output , is sixty sixty - two , sixty three more or less .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df
D :  Yeah , because it 's noise also .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  And we have

dialogue type : s
D :  I know .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^2.%--
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^am
D :  Well I don't know ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I th I I think that we I have the result more or less . Maybe .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
D :  I don't I 'm not sure but I remember @ @ that I can't show that .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  I will do that .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : h|s^ar
D :  Uh , no .

dialogue type : s^m
D :  TIMIT .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
D :  Yeah this for TIMIT .

dialogue type : s^aa^m^rt
D :  Noisy TIMIT .

dialogue type : s
D :  We have noisy TIMIT with the noise of the the TI - digits .

dialogue type : s
D :  And now we have another noisy TIMIT also with the noise of uh Italian database .

dialogue type : s
D :  This is the work that I did during this date

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and also mmm I H Hynek last week say that if I have time I can to begin to to study

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
D :  well seriously the France Telecom proposal

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
D :  to look at the code

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and something like that

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  to know exactly what they are doing

dialogue type : s
D :  because maybe that we can have some ideas

dialogue type : s
D :  but not only to read the proposal .

dialogue type : s
D :  Look insi look i carefully what they are doing with the program @ @ and

dialogue type : s^rt^tc
D :  I begin to to work also in that .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know why they have some constant in the expression of the lower energy .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know what that means .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Then maybe I can understand .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^bd^no
D :  I don't know exactly ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because well th I thought maybe they have a meaning .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  But I don't know what is the meaning of take exactly this value .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  Yeah , the e The effect I don't @ @ I can understand the effect of this ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  no ?

dialogue type : s
D :  because it 's to to do something like that .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  No ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|qo^cc
D :  Well . I I will look to try if I move this parameter in their code what happens ,

dialogue type : s^am
D :  maybe everything is Maybe they tres hole are on basis of this .

dialogue type : s^am
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  I this more or less anything

dialogue type : s
D :  I think that Stephane will arrive today or tomorrow .
