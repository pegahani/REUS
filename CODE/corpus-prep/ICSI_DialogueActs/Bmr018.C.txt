dialogue type : z
C :  Yeah , go ahead .

dialogue type : z
C :  Alright , and no crash .

dialogue type : z
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
C :  Hmm , no connection .

dialogue type : z
C :  I don't know when would be a good excuse for it ,

dialogue type : z
C :  but I just can't wait to be giving a talk t and and and use the example from last week with everybody t doing the digits at once .

dialogue type : z
C :  I 'd love to play somebody that .

dialogue type : z
C :  It was .

dialogue type : z
C :  It was really efficient .

dialogue type : z
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
C :  Everybody give the reports about what they were doing at exactly the same time ,

dialogue type : z
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : z
C :  Actually isn't that what we have been doing ?

dialogue type : qw^t^tc
C :  What are we doing ?

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : qw^bu^j
C :  What conference ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  That is right .

dialogue type : s
C :  The next weekend .

dialogue type : s
C :  That 's when they 're coming .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  That 's correct .

dialogue type : s^ar|sj^ba
C :  No , but that would be a good idea .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
C :  Why don't we w

dialogue type : s
C :  They 're not even gonna be here until eleven or so .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Cuz they 're flying up that day .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  Saturday .

dialogue type : s^r
C :  Saturday .

dialogue type : s^bu^r
C :  S Saturday .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bsc
C :  down from Seattle .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and they 'll end up here .

dialogue type : s
C :  So b and also Brian Kingsbury is actually flying from , uh , the east coast on that that morning .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , i I I will be I mean , he 's taking a very early flight

dialogue type : s
C :  and we do have the time work difference running the right way ,

dialogue type : sj
C :  but I still think that there 's no way we could start before eleven .

dialogue type : s
C :  It might end up really being twelve .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  So when we get closer we 'll find people 's plane schedules , and let everybody know .

dialogue type : fh|sj^ba
C :  Uh , So . That 's good .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Well we can start gathering those those ideas ,

dialogue type : s^co
C :  but then we we should firm it up by next next Thursday 's meeting .

dialogue type : s^arp
C :  Yes

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^am
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Can we pipeline it so that say there 's , uh , the transcriber gets done with a quarter of the meeting and then we you run it through this other other stuff ?

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : fg
C :  OK , so .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Oh , that 's right .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So the first thing is the automatic thing ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and then it 's then it 's then it 's the transcribers tightening stuff up ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and then it 's IBM .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  OK , so you might as well ha run the automatic thing over the entire meeting ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and then and then , uh , you would give IBM whatever was fixed .

dialogue type : s^aap
C :  Well , yeah , but start from the beginning and go to the end ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  So if they were only half way through then that 's what you 'd give IBM .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : qw.%-
C :  Why wouldn't we s @ @ w

dialogue type : qw.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qy
C :  I mean i are we trying to get something done by the time Brian comes ?

dialogue type : sj
C :  So if we if we were , then it seems like giving them something , whatever they had gotten up to , would be better than nothing .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So you 're talking about tightening up time boundaries ?

dialogue type : qw.%-
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm I 'm now entirely confused about what they do .

dialogue type : fh|qy^bu^d^rt
C :  So , they 're they 're looking at a mixed signal ,

dialogue type : qrr^rt.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qw
C :  what what are they looking at visually ?

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  But the procedure that you 're imagining , I mean , people vary from this , is that they have the mixed signal wave form in front of them ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  and they have multiple ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  uh , well , let 's see , there isn't we don't have transcription yet .

dialogue type : fh|s^bu
C :  So but there 's markers of some sort that have been happening automatically ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  and those show up on the mixed signal ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  There 's a @ @ clicks ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
C :  There 're separate ribbons .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  And is there a line moving across the waveform as it goes ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
C :  OK , so The way you 're imaging is they kind of play it ,

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  and they see oh this happened , then this happened , then and if it 's about right , they just sort of let it slide ,

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  and if it if it there 's a question on something , they stop and maybe look at the individual wave form .

dialogue type : s
C :  They they might look at it ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bs
C :  But right now , to do this limitation , the switching is going to be switching of the audio ? Is what she 's saying .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  so they 're using their ears to do these markings anyway .

dialogue type : fg|qy^d^rt^tc
C :  So , um , Done with that ?

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Does any I forget ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  does anybody , uh , working on any any Eurospeech submission related to this ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
C :  Yeah there was that we

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  that 's right ,

dialogue type : s
C :  we had that one conversation about , uh , what what what did it mean for , uh , one of those speakers to be pathological ,

dialogue type : qy.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  There 's zero , a little bit , and a lot .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Y yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu
C :  Oh was it fifteen ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  What we 're calling .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No , but there 's a little difference ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and we haven't looked at it for digits ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
C :  And so ,

dialogue type : s
C :  cuz because what he was what I was saying when I looked at those things is it it I was almost gonna call it quadrimodal because because there was a whole lot of cases where it was zero percent .

dialogue type : s
C :  They just plain got it all right .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then there and then there was another bunch that were couple percent or something .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see .

dialogue type : b^rt
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  Unless maybe we do this , uh , um , cancellation business .

dialogue type : s|s^bk
C :  Oh , the short amount of time thing , right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Well

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  that you 're not gonna miss something ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  That 's what he just said .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well I know what we 're not turning in to Eurospeech ,

dialogue type : s
C :  a redo of the HLT paper .

dialogue type : s
C :  That I don't wanna do that ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  but .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  Bleep .

dialogue type : s
C :  You know , that wa that was the battery meter saying that it was fully charged ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : b^rt
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  these are conferences that have d really different emphases .

dialogue type : s
C :  Whereas HLT and and Eurospeech , pretty pretty pretty similar , so I I I can't see really just putting in the same thing ,

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : b^rt
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , I would see Eurospeech if we have some Eurospeech papers , these will be paper p p uh , submissions .

dialogue type : s
C :  These will be things that are particular things ,

dialogue type : s
C :  aspects of it that we 're looking at , rather than , you know , attempt at a global paper about it .

dialogue type : b
C :  Well .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  See ya .

dialogue type : s
C :  I don't think we 'll go much longer .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
C :  see ya .

dialogue type : h|s
C :  Well , but I had it on I had it on this morning and it was fine .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^j.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa^j
C :  Yeah

dialogue type : sj^ba^j
C :  that 's good !

dialogue type : s^j^m
C :  Hang a five pound weight off the off the back .

dialogue type : s^r
C :  Weight .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Or maybe this could be helpful just for evening the conversation between people .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
C :  If people those who talk a lot have to wear heavier weights or something ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  and um ,

dialogue type : fg|qw
C :  um , so , uh , what was I gonna say ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Oh , yeah , I was gonna say , uh , I had these , uh , conversations with NIST folks also while I was there

dialogue type : s
C :  and and , uh , um , so they they have their their plan for a room , uh , with , um , mikes in the middle of the table , and , uh , close - mounted mikes ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  and they 're talking about close - mounted and lapels , just cuz

dialogue type : s^aa^m
C :  sort of and the array .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  And yeah , like multiple multiple video cameras coverin covering every everybody every place in the room ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  well , there 's some discussion of fifty - nine ,

dialogue type : s
C :  they might go down to fifty - seven

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Because , uh , there is , uh , some pressure from a couple people at the meeting for them to use a KEMAR head .

dialogue type : s
C :  I forget what KEMAR , uh , stands for ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but what it is is it 's dummy head that is very specially designed ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and and and , so what they 're actually doing is they 're really there 's really two recording systems .

dialogue type : s
C :  So they may not be precisely synchronous , but the but there 's two two recording systems ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  one with , I think , twenty - four channels , and one with sixty - four channels .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And the sixty - four channel one is for the array ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but they 've got some empty channels there ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  and anyway they like they 're saying they may give up a couple or something if for for the KEMAR head if they go go with that .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , I 'm not too worried about that .

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  No , we just had some discussions , various discussions with them .

dialogue type : h|s
C :  Um , yeah , we sh we should just have you have you read it , but , I mea ba i i uh , we 've all got these little proceedings ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  but , um , basically , it was about , um , uh , going to a new task where you have insufficient data and using using data from something else , and adapting , and how well that works .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C :  Uh , so in in fact it was pretty related to what Liz and Andreas did , uh , except that this was not with meeting stuff , it was with

dialogue type : fh|qy^rt
C :  uh , like I think they s didn't they start off with Broadcast News system ?

dialogue type : s^rt.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  TI - digits was one of them , and , uh , Wall Street Journal .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^am
C :  Probably .

dialogue type : sj
C :  That might be hard .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b
C :  sure .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , and they have I mean they have better adaptation than we had than that that system ,

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : h
C :  um ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  actually what we should do , uh , I haven't said anything about this ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
C :  but probably the five of us should pick out a paper or two that that , uh , you know , got our interest ,

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  and we should go around the room at one of the Tuesday lunch meetings and say , you know , what what was good about the conference ,

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  Columbia have anything ?

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
C :  Yeah , that was an interesting discussion ,

dialogue type : fh|%-
C :  uh , I

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  Well , I didn't have as much disagreement as I would have liked ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  but I didn't wanna I wouldn I didn't wanna get into it because , uh , you know , it was the application was one I didn't know anything about ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  uh , it just would have been , you know , me getting up to be argumentative ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  but but , uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  I mean , the missing thi

dialogue type : fh|s
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  But I mea i wh it @ @ that 's that 's dissing it , uh , improperly ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , it was a nice study .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  was it w was it word - sense ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  And so , what they did was they had these different kinds of learning machines , and they had different amounts of data ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and so they did like , you know , eight different methods that everybody , you know , uh , argues about about , " Oh my my kind of learning machine is better than your kind of learning machine . "

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And , uh , they were started off with a million words that they used ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which was evidently a number that a lot of people doing that particular kind of task had been using .

dialogue type : s
C :  So they went up , being Microsoft , they went up to a billion .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  well , it 's a big company ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I didn't I didn't mean it as a ne anything negative ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  but i i i

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , I mean , yes .

dialogue type : s
C :  Of course there was the kind of effect that , you know , one would expect that uh that you got better and better performance with more and more data .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um , but the the real point was that the the different learning machines are sort of all over the place ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and and by by going up significantly in data you can have much bigger effect then by switching learning machines

dialogue type : s
C :  and furthermore which learning machine was on top kind of depended on where you were in this picture ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : qw^d.%--
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^am
C :  could well be .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  So so , I mean , that was that was kind of , you know , it 's a good point ,

dialogue type : sj
C :  but the problem I had with it was that the implications out of this was that , uh , the kind of choices you make about learning machines were therefore irrelevant

dialogue type : s
C :  which is not at n t as for as I know in in tasks I 'm more familiar with @ @ is not at all true .

dialogue type : s
C :  What i what is is true is that different learning machines have different properties ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and you wanna know what those properties are .

dialogue type : s
C :  And someone else sort of implied that well we s you know , a all the study of learning machine we still don't know what those properties are .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  We don't know them perfectly , but we know that some kinds use more memory and and some other kinds use more computation

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
C :  It w

dialogue type : s^am
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Eventually .

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  O one would

dialogue type : h
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  well that 's getting cl

dialogue type : fh
C :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s^aap
C :  yeah , the spread was still pretty wide that 's th that 's true ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  but but , uh , I think it would be irntu intu intuition that this would be the case ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but , uh , to really see it and to have the intuition is quite different ,

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
C :  I mean , I think somebody w w let 's see who was talking about earlier that the effect of having a lot more data is quite different in Switchboard than it is in in Broadcast News ,

dialogue type : b
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : b^rt
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^tc.x
C :  But anyway , I I I think it 's it 's just the the i it 's it 's it 's not really the conclusion they came to so much , as the conclusion that some of the , uh , uh , commenters in the crowd came up with

dialogue type : s
C :  that , uh , you know , this therefore is further evidence that , you know , more data is really all you should care about ,

dialogue type : sj
C :  and that I thought was just kind of going too far the other way ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  and and the the , uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  one one person ga g g got up and made a a brief defense ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  uh , but it was a different kind of grounds ,

dialogue type : s
C :  it was that that , uh , i w the reason people were not using so much data before was not because they were stupid or didn't realize data was important , but in fact th they didn't have it available .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um , but the other point to make a again is that , uh , machine learning still does matter ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  but it it matters more in some situations than in others ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and it and also there 's there 's not just mattering or not mattering , but there 's mattering in different ways .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , you might be in some situation where you care how much memory you 're using ,

dialogue type : s
C :  or you care , you know , what recall time is ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  And there 's cost !

dialogue type : s^r
C :  There 's just plain cost ,

dialogue type : qh
C :  you know ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  one person has a system that requires ten thousand hours to train on , and the other only requires a hundred ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and they both do about the same because the hundred hour one was smarter ,

dialogue type : sj^ba
C :  that 's that 's gonna be better .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because people , I mean , there isn't gonna be just one system that people train on

dialogue type : s
C :  and then that 's it for the r for all of time .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , people are gonna be doing other different things , and so it these these things matters matter .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Anyway ,

dialogue type : s
C :  tea is tea is , uh , starting .

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  Let 's do it all at once .

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  We @ @ let 's try that again .

dialogue type : z
C :  Boy , is that ever efficient .
