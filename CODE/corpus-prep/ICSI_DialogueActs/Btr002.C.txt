dialogue type : s^rt:s
C :  To me , I don't necessarily put , um , like a d a p a p a period after that " so " .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  I might actually either put a dash after it depending on whether or not they got unt interrupted or something ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  or I would maybe even act as though they were , um , just trailing off .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  So put that those two dots after it .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um , uh , which depending on what 's going on , like , I 'll do that .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Cuz to me it sounds more like they 're trailing off .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2|s^bk
C :  Period . Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  That 's another thing , is i if you 're not a native speaker of English you might not pick up ,

dialogue type : s
C :  because , uh , you know , every language has different , um , intonation mappings .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  And also if you 're a non - native speaker transcribing it , you wouldn't necessarily kn uh , kn understand the conventions of English t intonation as , you know , intimately as a native speaker might .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  n Yeah .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^nd|s^ar

C : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s:s
C :  Yeah , " grou " uh , " gruesuh " .

dialogue type : s^f|s
C :  You know . And then you would kind of have to come up with some sort of consonant

dialogue type : s:s
C :  and maybe it 's an " M " to you .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  " Fff " . Because also , I mean , " F " is " Fff " . is , um , " Fff " .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df.%-
C : 

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , because it 's , um , bilabial too .

dialogue type : %--
C :  " Fff " . you know , you 'll

dialogue type : s
C :  di uh , or interl interdental , " fff " .

dialogue type : s:s|qy^d^f^g
C :  you know , it 's close enough , I guess , to " mmm " , you know .

dialogue type : s
C :  You 're getting the closure of the lips .

dialogue type : s
C :  So maybe that 's what they were do getting .

dialogue type : s^bd^no
C :  I don't know .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  Well , maybe it 's because they don't realize that you 're supposed to sp

dialogue type : qy.%--
C :  Do they ?

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , maybe they don't really realize that you 're supposed to split it up . Or something

dialogue type : s:s
C : 

dialogue type : s^r:s
C :  I hear this other person 's voice just as clearly

dialogue type : s:s
C :  and I realize it 's not Jane ,

dialogue type : s:s
C :  and I realize it 's not a female even ,

dialogue type : s:s
C :  but , um , because it 's so clear on this channel , I 'm supposed to transcribe it . "

dialogue type : s
C :  I I 'd imagine that 's p that might be what that is .

dialogue type : s^na|s^df^na
C :  That 's true . They do they do say that m men 's voices c carry better .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  I mean , that 's why they use , like , I think

dialogue type : qh^t1
C :  who was telling me ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Ian Maddieson was talking about this , that they use male voices in , um , in , um , airports .

dialogue type : s^df
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C :  Yeah , that 's th It fits into a hearer 's range of perception , um , better than a lot of female voices .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so that 's why they use male voices .

dialogue type : s
C :  We were just talking about that .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C :  d Yeah , depending on their auditory , um , capabilities .

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
C :  I mean , if their auditory capabilities , uh , have been , you know , um , squished down like in a certain place where it would be n easier for a person with normal , um , hearing to hear a male 's voice ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : %--
C :  and , i uh , e i u

dialogue type : s
C :  if that part of the brain normally codes for , you know , male voices , uh , in a normal hearer , then they might not be able to .

dialogue type : s^f|qy^rt
C :  You know . Does that make sense ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Like if that part is damaged .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  but yeah , if I guess for most h hearers it 's just easier .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it 's like a certain , uh , kind of , like , rough male voice too ,

dialogue type : s^e
C : 

dialogue type : s^bsc
C :  raspy , I mean ,

dialogue type : s
C :  apparently .

dialogue type : s^m^na
C :  Is better .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
C :  Yeah , I guess so .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  It 's really interesting .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk|s:s
C :  Right . Yeah . I was just saying that it , like , you know , sometimes , um , if Remember I was saying , like , if there 's a discrepancy between fricatives , you know , like , um , " shuh " or " suh " will show up in a certain part of the spectrum ,

dialogue type : s.%-:s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
C :  um , by filtering in some of the older phones .

dialogue type : s.%-

dialogue type : b
C :  Y right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  I didn't get that from him , actually .

dialogue type : s
C :  I felt like , um , he 's basically saying that for our for all intents and purposes with this , it 's covering whatever sounds are necessary to be covered , like everything .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
C :  That 's that 's what I th

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
C :  Yeah . Yeah , I do too .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s^rt
C :  Yeah . So , like , you were saying , like in the case of something with clipping ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  does it were you saying that , uh it it increases to or , expands to accommodate that ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  Or ,

dialogue type : s^bk^m
C :  no ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right . Oh , OK . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s
C :  I do remember those , actually .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  Especially if they also got louder too , and they hit it ,

dialogue type : s^fe
C :  it was just like " whoahh ! "

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^aa|s

dialogue type : s.%--

dialogue type : s^e
C :  or even forward ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  I 'll use the mouse ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : h|s
C :  Oh , uh , in terms of , um , if , uh if it 's it 's if it 's cut off ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  like the beginning of an utterance ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'll move it move the line back .

dialogue type : s
C :  And I usually just use the mouse .

dialogue type : qw
C :  How do you do that with the keyboard ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh . y

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  Oh , OK . So you just do it that way .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK . OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  OK . To me that 's takes longer than to do it with the mouse .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
C :  Because you can just click y

dialogue type : s^m^na
C :  I just drag the line .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Oh yeah , that 's true .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Right , then I 'll drag it .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  That would be great .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I 've erased entire utterances before , accidentally .

dialogue type : s^2

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  do you do this too ?

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm so scared .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I won't do it .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s:qw

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  But then , like , I think there 's a different keyboard on

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  I always forget th

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s
C :  No , the other one .

dialogue type : s^m^na
C :  Amaretto .

dialogue type : %-
C :  I i

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Right . And it 's and I always use I tend to use Linguine .

dialogue type : s
C :  But the last couple times , like , you 've stolen Linguine before I can get to it .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I

dialogue type : s
C :  go onto Amaretto ,

dialogue type : s^ba^bd^rt
C :  which is fine .

dialogue type : s
C :  But then like , um , it takes me a good , like , ten minutes to get re - used to that keyboard .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s^ba
C :  No , it 's really OK .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
C :  But , yeah . I I I have noticed that I 'll screw some stuff up , like , when I 'm trying to get re - adj

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  The PC ?

dialogue type : s
C :  I would vote for the PC .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar^bsc
C :  Or no !

dialogue type : s
C :  I like the Linguine keyboard .

dialogue type : s
C :  That 's all I know .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
C :  Linguine is the one in the corner .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah . So , basically , right as you walk in the door , the one straight ahead of you is Amaretto .

dialogue type : s
C :  And the one to the left of that against the far corner is Linguine .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Nice .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^m^na
C :  Yeah , I could get used to it too .

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s
C :  That kind of makes sense

dialogue type : s^df.%-
C : 

dialogue type : fg|%-
C :  Yeah , i

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C :  Cuz , yeah , if the s the resolution If it 's moving too slowly then , like , if you were to click on some place then it makes sense that it would get kind of confused .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  But if it 's moving quickly , seems that it 's covering more ground faster ,

dialogue type : fh|s^bd^no
C :  so I don't know .

dialogue type : s
C :  I usually just don't use that , I think .

dialogue type : b
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
C :  I tend to make it move fast .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right . Right . Right . Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah . That 's the reason I separate it out .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , yes .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Because the , uh the waveform becomes too stretched out .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s
C :  uhhh ! There was this one meeting I was transcribing , there were nine nine speakers ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and by the end of it , I was so entirely sick of listening to the same conversation all over again

dialogue type : s^e
C :  nine times in slow - mo !

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^rt:s^rt

dialogue type : s
C :  I do that .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  I 'll end utterances with " so " or " and " .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  and it 'll just be a trailing off , and I 'll think , " Man . I would be such a pain in the butt to transcribe . "

dialogue type : %--
C :  Like I just , uh , I g

dialogue type : fh
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'll I 'll do the same thing as you do ,

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s:s
C :  and I 'll go , " Wow , I just I 'm glad I 'm not transcribing him or her " .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm amazed sometimes that we manage to communicate .

dialogue type : s^f|s^rt
C :  You know ? Cuz people will say just , like , you know , monosyllabic little grunts and squeaks and things ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and it means something .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : b.%

dialogue type : s^e.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s
C :  Maybe this is what it 's like to be blind .

dialogue type : s
C :  No no visual input at all .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  And you get so much more aware of all of it too .

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^2

dialogue type : s^m

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , the one I kn I kn get all the time is " tsk "

dialogue type : s:s
C :  It 's it 's , uh like I don't know how I just transcribe it as I say , like , " click "

dialogue type : s
C :  and then I say , " It 's like a vocal gesture . "

dialogue type : s:s^rt
C :  Like a shrug or a vocal some some sort of like , " Well , there it is " .

dialogue type : s:s^rt
C :  Or , " That 's it . "

dialogue type : s|s^f
C :  Or something like that , you know .

dialogue type : s
C :  That people do that one a lot .

dialogue type : s
C :  And there was one speaker who used to do it constantly .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  And after a while , I started getting confused as to whether or not he was , like , just going " tsk - tsk - tsk - tsk - tsk " to himself ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  or whether he was meaning it in conversat

dialogue type : s
C :  Sometimes it was really obvious that he meant it as some sort of vocal cue .

dialogue type : s
C :  But then sometimes it was more ambiguous .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Like it was tough to tell ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  um , because he would just always be clicking .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , this guy does a lot of single ones .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--

dialogue type : s^no

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s
C :  Unless I 'm really not paying any attention

dialogue type : s^e^rt
C :  like , you know , if I 'm at a party or something , and I 'm just sort of having a good time , then it doesn't really matter ,

dialogue type : s^rt

C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s
C :  Or something like a meeting where , you know , I mean everybody says their little schpiel

dialogue type : s
C :  and people are meant to be , you know , pretty pretty quiet and attentive for the most part .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then they let them finish ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and then somebody else comes in

dialogue type : s
C :  and says something about it .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and in a n like a friendly conversation I I notice that that 's not really true .

dialogue type : s
C :  Like what you were saying .

dialogue type : b
C :  Huh !

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  That 's interesting .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so , I 'm glad you said that

dialogue type : s
C :  because , um , that actually takes a good amount of time , and like pretty strict concentration to d to do that .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
C :
