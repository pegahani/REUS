dialogue type : z
F :  OK .

dialogue type : z
F :  It 's the ear - plug mike .

dialogue type : z
F :  No .

dialogue type : z
F :  Huh ? What ? Huh ?

dialogue type : z
F :  It it 's a fairly good mike , actually .

dialogue type : z
F :  Well , I shouldn't say it 's a good mike .

dialogue type : z
F :  All I really know is that the signal level is OK .

dialogue type : z
F : 

dialogue type : z
F :  the quality .

dialogue type : s^fe
F :  Ugh !

dialogue type : s^t
F :  So I didn't send out agenda items

dialogue type : s
F :  because until five minutes ago we only had one agenda item

dialogue type : s
F :  and now we have two .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So . And , uh .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well We haven't really started ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but I thought we more we more or less did Meeting Recorder stuff last week ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  But I figure also if they 're short agenda items , we could also do a little bit of each .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^t3
F :  I seem to be having difficulty getting this adjusted .

dialogue type : s^t3
F :  Here we go .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , uh , as most of you should know , I did send out the consent form thingies

dialogue type : fh
F :  and , uh ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so far no one has made any Ach ! any comments on them .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , no on no one has bleeped out anything .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  I don't expect anyone to .

dialogue type : fh
F :  But .

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No .

dialogue type : s
F :  We had spoken w about this before

dialogue type : s
F :  and we had decided that they have they only needed to sign once .

dialogue type : s
F :  And the agreement that they already signed simply said that we would give them an opportunity .

dialogue type : s
F :  So as long as we do that , we 're covered .

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh , July fifteenth .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  Jane told me July fifteenth .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , that 's what I set it .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Oh . I I didn't understand that there was something specific .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I had heard July fifteenth ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so that 's what I put .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df
F :  Yeah . As I said , we I just got one date

dialogue type : s
F :  and that 's the one I used .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So . But I can send a follow - up .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean , it 's almost all us .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean the people who are in the meeti this meeting was , uh , these the meetings that in are in set one .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba^na
F :  Right . I mean , that 's fine .

dialogue type : s
F :  I we don't My understanding of what we had agreed upon when we had spoken about this months ago was that , uh , we don't actually need a reply .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  We just need to tell them that they can do it if they want .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so no reply is no changes .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah . The reason I did that it was just so that people would not censor not ask to have stuff removed because it was transcribed incorrectly ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aap
F :  When they submit the form , it gets processed and emailed to me .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , the only thing I said in the email is that the data is going to be released on the fifteenth .

dialogue type : s
F :  I didn't give any other deadline .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  So my feeling is if someone after the fifteenth says , " wow I suddenly found something " , we 'll delete it from our record .

dialogue type : s
F :  We just won't delete it from whatever 's already been released .

dialogue type : qo
F :  What else can we do ?

dialogue type : qo:s
F :  If someone says " hey , look , I found something in this meeting and it 's libelous and I want it removed " . What can we do ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  We have to remove it .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Well , did you read the email and look at the pages I sent ?

dialogue type : s^bk|qh^cs
F :  No . OK , well why don't you do that

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  and then make comments on what you want me to change ?

dialogue type : s
F :  I already did decide something ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and that 's what 's in the email .

dialogue type : qo^cs
F :  And if you disagree with it , why don't you read it and give me comments on it ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^no^rt
F :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^am
F :  You should be .

dialogue type : s
F :  You should be channel B .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , they 've already signed a form .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  And the s and the form was approved by Human Subjects ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  so , eh , that 's gonna be a little hard to modify .

dialogue type : s
F :  Here .

dialogue type : s
F :  You can read what you already signed .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  Oh , I just I didn't wanna do that ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because I don't wanna have a discussion with every person if I can avoid it .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So what I wanted to do was just send it out

dialogue type : s
F :  and say " on the fifteenth , the data is released ,

dialogue type : s
F :  if you wanna do something about it , do something about it ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but that 's it " .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
F :  Well , OK . l Let me Let me reverse this .

dialogue type : s
F :  So let 's say someone I send this out ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and someone doesn't respond .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Do we delete every meeting that they were in ?

dialogue type : s
F :  I don't think so .

dialogue type : s
F :  That will happen .

dialogue type : s^r
F :  That will absolutely happen .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because people don't read their email ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  or they 'll read and say " I don't care about that ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I 'm not gonna delete anything "

dialogue type : s
F :  and they don just won't reply to it .

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No .

dialogue type : s
F :  We have what they put on the speaker form ,

dialogue type : s
F :  which was just generic contact information .

dialogue type : fg|s^df
F :  Yeah . I mean I thought we had discussed this , like , a year ago .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so it seems like this is a little odd for it to be coming up yet again .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : fg|qh^cs.%--
F :  OK . Well , why don't you talk t

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Morgan , can you talk to our lawyer about it ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and find out what the status is on this ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Cuz I don't wanna do something that we don't need to .

dialogue type : %--
F :  Because

dialogue type : s
F :  what I 'm telling you , people won't respond to the email .

dialogue type : s
F :  No matter what you do , you there 're gonna be people who you 're gonna have to make a lot of effort to get in contact with .

dialogue type : qh
F :  And do we want to spend that effort ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , we had talked about this before

dialogue type : s
F :  and I thought that we had even gone by the lawyers asking about that

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  that they 've already signed once .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , it 's just , we 've gone from one extreme to the other , where at one point , a few months ago , Morgan was you were saying let 's not do anything ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
F :  we 're saying we have to follow up each person and get a signature ?

dialogue type : qw
F :  I mean , what are we gonna doing here ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Then I think we had better find out ,

dialogue type : s^df.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
F :  For for th

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  Sending lots of spam .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg|qw
F :  Well , so how far do we have to go ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Do we need to get someone 's signature ?

dialogue type : qrr
F :  Or , is email enough ?

dialogue type : qy^j^rt
F :  Do we have to have it notarized ?

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : h|s^na
F :  Uh . If they submit the form , I get it .

dialogue type : s
F :  If they don't submit the form , it goes in the general web log .

dialogue type : s
F :  But that 's not sufficient .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Cuz if someone just visits the web site that doesn't imply anything in particular .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  I 'm already on it .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
F :  W

dialogue type : s
F :  For this set , I 'm not worried ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because we basically know everyone on it .

dialogue type : s
F :  You know , they 're all more or less here

dialogue type : s
F :  or it 's it 's Eric and Dan and so on .

dialogue type : s
F :  But for some of the others , you 're talking about visitors who are gone from ICSI , whose email addresses may or may not work ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : qw
F :  So what are we gonna do when we run into someone that we can't get in touch with ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^2^bu^d^rt
F :  Other methods ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , the qu the question is just whether how active it has to be .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , because they they filled out a contact information

dialogue type : s
F :  and that 's where I 'm sending the information .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so far everyone has done email .

dialogue type : s
F :  There isn't anyone who did , uh , any other contact method .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  So my original impression was that that was sufficient ,

dialogue type : s
F :  that if they give us contact information and that contact information isn't accurate that we fulfilled our burden .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
F :  Alright .

dialogue type : fg|s^cc
F :  Yep . And we 'll see how many people respond to that email .

dialogue type : s
F :  So far , two people have .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2^cs|s^aa
F :  Respond to the email . Yep .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Well , and also if we want it ready by the fifteenth , that means we better give them deadline of the first ,

dialogue type : s
F :  if we have any prayer of actually getting everyone to respond in time .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^fe
F :  Ugh !

dialogue type : s
F :  Disk space ,

dialogue type : s^fe
F :  oh my god !

dialogue type : s
F :  I hadn't thought about that .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  any meeting which has any bleeps in it we need yet another copy of .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
F :  No , of course not .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  You need all the channels .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  Yes . Absolutely . There 's a lot of cross - talk .

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  Well , but you have to copy the whole file .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because we 're gonna be releasing the whole file .

dialogue type : s^am|s
F :  Yeah . It 's just I hate deleting any data .

dialogue type : s
F :  So I I don't want I really would rather make a copy of it , rather than bleep it out

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Overlapping .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  So , it 's it 's exactly a censor bleep .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt.%--:s^fe.%--
F :  So what I really think is " bleep "

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I delete the old one , put the new one in .

dialogue type : s
F :  There 's nothing left of the original signal .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yeah . It would be qui quite easy to get it back again .

dialogue type : qw^br^co
F :  Say again ?

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah , that 's true . Yeah . Yep , that 's true .

dialogue type : s
F :  Backwards .

dialogue type : %-
F :  But ,

dialogue type : qy
F :  ha you 've seen the this the speech recognition system that reversed very short segments .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Did you read that paper ?

dialogue type : s
F :  It wouldn't work .

dialogue type : s
F :  The speech recognizer still works .

dialogue type : s^bk^m|s^aa
F :  Forward but backward . That 's right .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Good point .

dialogue type : s^aap
F :  A point .

dialogue type : fg|s^fa
F :  Well , I 'm sorry if I sound a little peeved about this whole thing .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  It 's just we 've had meeting after meeting after meeting a on this

dialogue type : s
F :  and it seems like we 've never gotten it resolved .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Well , and that 's exactly why I did it the way I did it ,

dialogue type : s
F :  which is the default is if you do nothing we 're gonna release it .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  Because , you know , I have my stack of emails of to d to be done ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  that , you know , fifty or sixty long ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and the ones at the top I 'm never gonna get to .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa^j
F :  Yeah , right .

dialogue type : qy.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^ba
F :  Yeah . That 's actually definitely a good point .

dialogue type : s
F :  The m email doesn't specify that you can just reply to the email , as op as opposed to going to the form

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : fg|s^2
F :  Yeah , release .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bd
F :  A lot of mailers support return receipt .

dialogue type : s^bd
F :  But it doesn't confirm that they 've read it .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2^bk
F :  Oh , just a button .

dialogue type : b
F :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^am
F :  Yeah . Unfor - Yeah , we could do that .

dialogue type : s^ba^df
F :  But I hate that .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Well , I could put a URL in there without any difficulty

dialogue type : s
F :  and even pretty simple MIME readers can do that .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : fg|s^bs
F :  Yeah . Reply .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , I cuz I use a text mail reader .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  You you read email in VI ?

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  You could put wed bugs in the email .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , what my s expectation is , is that we 'll send out one of these emails every time a meeting has been checked and is ready .

dialogue type : s
F :  So . Tha - that was my intention .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  that we just happened to have a bunch all at once .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Is that the way it 's gonna be , you think , Jane ?

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah . Now we haven't actually had anyone go through that meeting , to see whether the transcript is correct

dialogue type : s
F :  and to see how much was missed and all that sort of stuff .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So at some point we need to do that .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , the one thing I noticed is it did miss a lot of backchannels .

dialogue type : s
F :  There are a fair number of " yeahs " and " uh - huhs " that it 's just that aren't in there .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yes , absolutely . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes , absolutely . Absolutely .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah . They 're they 're not in the segmented .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's not that the IBM people didn't do it .

dialogue type : s
F :  Just they didn't get marked .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  There 's another meeting in here , what , at four ?

dialogue type : qy^d^g
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^co
F :  Yeah , so we have to finish by three forty - five .

dialogue type : s
F :  U uncertains .

dialogue type : s
F :  Web master .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^t3
F :  Spit upon ?

dialogue type : s^ar|s
F :  No , these are ours .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's cool .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , but I bet I bet they 're acoustically challenging parts anyway , though .

dialogue type : qy^bh
F :  Oh , really ?

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Oh , so it 's just jargon .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  It probably won't do any better .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Did I say that ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  Well , that 's exactly why I put the extra option in ,

dialogue type : s
F :  is that I was afraid people would say , " let 's censor that because it 's wrong " ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and I don't want them to do that .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^fe
F :  Ugh !

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's probably impedance matching problems .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  They 're just earphones .

dialogue type : s^e^ng
F :  They 're not headsets .

dialogue type : s^e^ng
F :  They 're not microphones .

dialogue type : s
F :  But if you need it , just get it .

dialogue type : s
F :  Come on .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  W uh , could you email out the brand ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Cuz I think sounds like people are interested .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh , the only one was Don wanted to , uh , talk about disk space yet again .

dialogue type : s
F :  Oh , I thought you meant the disk space .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  Yeah , we know disk space is short .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
F :  Yeah , it was really goo

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh , well , we 'll give you one then .

dialogue type : s^by^fe
F :  Oh , no .

dialogue type : qo^m^rt
F :  Soon ?

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No .

dialogue type : s
F :  Ne - new disks .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  Once they come in . Sure .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
F :  If you 're if you 're desperate , I have some space on my drive .

dialogue type : s
F :  But I I vacillate between no space free and a few gig free .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  A hundred gig here ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  a hundred gig there .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's eventually real disk space .

dialogue type : b
F :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Huh .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  Or she 's getting a good early start .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  When we remember to fill them out .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
F :  And Don is gonna be helping out with that .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Did you wanna talk about that this afternoon ?

dialogue type : s^e^rt
F :  Not here , but later today ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK . OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , OK .

F :  but we 're kind of running late .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  Fifteen minutes .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  If you wanna do a quick

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
F :  Yeah . Well , we can skip the digits .

dialogue type : s
F :  Whatever you want .

dialogue type : qw
F :  What do you have to say ?

dialogue type : s^na
F :  I 'm interested ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^fa
F :  Sorry .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
F :  No . We were just talking before about alternating the subject of the meeting .

dialogue type : s
F :  And this week we were gonna try to do t automatic transcription status .

dialogue type : s
F :  But we sort of failed .

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No .

dialogue type : qh^rt
F :  Did we ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  OK . So now now we have the schedule .

dialogue type : s^cc^t
F :  So next week we 'll do automatic transcription status ,

dialogue type : s
F :  plus anything that 's real timely .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
F :  Whew !

dialogue type : s^j
F :  Dodged that bullet .
