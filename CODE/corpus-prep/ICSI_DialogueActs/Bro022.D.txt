dialogue type : s.%--
D :  And , one of the things that last week ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  eh , say here is that maybe the problem was with the diff

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because the signal have different level of energy .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , maybe , talking with Stephane and with Sunil , we decide that maybe it was interesting to to apply on - line normalization before applying VTS .

dialogue type : s
D :  But then we decided that that 's it doesn't work absolutely , because we modified also the noise .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , thinking about that , we we then we decide that maybe is a good idea .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  We don't know .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  I don't hav

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I didn't do the experiment yet to apply VTS in cepstral domain .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , we s decide to m to to obtain the new expression if we work in the cepstral domain .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Well . I am working in that now ,

dialogue type : s^no
D :  but I 'm not sure if that will be usefu useful .

dialogue type : fh
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  It 's k it 's k

D :  but this it 's work .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't have any feeling if this will work better than apply VTS aft in cepstral domain will work better than apply in m mel in filter bank domain .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I r I 'm not sure .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't I don't know absolutely nothing .

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
D :  Yeah ?

D :  Ye

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yea

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  I was thinking to to to estimate the noise with the first frames

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  and then apply the VAD ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  before the on - line normalization .

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : fg
D :  Well ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I am thinking about that and working about that ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I don't have result this week .

dialogue type : b
