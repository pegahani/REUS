dialogue type : z
C :  Alright .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Good .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  OK so , let 's get started .

dialogue type : s
C :  Nancy said she 's coming

dialogue type : s
C :  and that means she will be .

dialogue type : fh|s^t
C :  Um . My suggestion is that Robert and Johno sort of give us a report on last week 's adventures uh to start .

dialogue type : s
C :  So everybody knows there were these guys f uh from Heidelber - uh , uh , actually from uh DFKI uh , part of the German SmartKom project , who were here for the week

dialogue type : s
C :  and , I think got a lot done .

dialogue type : s^j.x
C :  It doesn't know " I " .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Alright .

dialogue type : sj^cs
C :  So it might be worth , Keith , you looking at this ,

dialogue type : h
C :  um

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah

dialogue type : fg
C :  I thi

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
C :  So . I think it 's not worth going over in the group ,

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  but sort of when you get free and you have the time uh either Robert or Johno or I can walk you through it .

dialogue type : s
C :  And you can ask all the questions about how this all fits together .

dialogue type : sj
C :  It 's eee messy

dialogue type : s
C :  but once you understand it you understand it .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's it 's There 's nothing really complicated about it .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  Now , we 're we 're not committed for our research to do any of those things .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
C :  So uh we are committed for our funding .

dialogue type : qy^d^f
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa|%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s^df
C :  n no , to just get the dem get the demos they need .

dialogue type : qy^d^f
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
C :  So between us all we have t to get th the demos they need .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  If it turns out we can also give them lots more than that by , you know , tapping into other things we do , that 's great .

dialogue type : s
C :  But i it turns out not to be in an any of the contracts

dialogue type : fh|s^e
C :  and , s deliberately .

dialogue type : fh|s^df
C :  So , the reason I 'd like you to understand uh what 's going on in this demo system is not because it 's important to the research .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's just for closure .

dialogue type : s:qw
C :  So that if we come up with a question of " could we fit this deeper stuff in there ? " or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  You know what the hell we we 're talking about fitting in .

dialogue type : s
C :  So it 's just , uh in the sam same actually with the rest of us

dialogue type : s
C :  we just need to really understand what 's there .

dialogue type : qy
C :  Is there anything we can make use of ?

dialogue type : fh|qy
C :  Uh , is there anything we can give back , beyond th the sort of minimum requirements ?

dialogue type : s
C :  But none of that has a short time fuse .

dialogue type : s
C :  So th the demo the demo requirements for this Fall are sort of taken care of as of later this week or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then So , it 's probably fifteen months or something until there 's another serious demo requirement .

dialogue type : s
C :  That doesn't mean we don't think about it for fifteen months ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but it means we can not think about it for six months .

dialogue type : fh|s^t^tc
C :  So . The plan for this summer uh , really is to step back from the applied project ,

dialogue type : s
C :  keep the d keep the context open , but actually go after the basic issues .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  so The idea is there 's this uh , other subgroup that 's worrying about formalizing the nota getting a notation .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  But sort of in parallel with that , uh , the hope is tha in particularly you will work on constructions in English Ge - and German for this domain ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  but y not worry about parsing them or fitting them into SmartKom or any of the other anything lik any other constraints for the time being .

dialogue type : sj
C :  It 's hard enough to get it semantically and syntactically right and then and get the constructions in their form and stuff .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , I don I don't want you f feeling that you have to somehow meet all these other constraints .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um . And similarly with the parsing , uh we 're gonna worry about parsing uh , the general case

dialogue type : s^e
C :  you know , construction parser for general constructions .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And , if we need a cut - down version for something , or whatever , we 'll worry about that later .

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  So I 'd like to , for the summer turn into science mode .

dialogue type : sj
C :  And I assume that 's also , uh , your plan as well .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  But but we we 're swit

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  So , c sh we could set that up as actually an institute wide thing ?

dialogue type : s^e^rt
C :  Just give a talk in the big room , and and so peo people know what 's going on ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  when you 're ready ?

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  That 's the level at which you know we can just li invite everybody and say " this is a project that we 've been working on and here 's a demo version of it " and stuff like that .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Indeed .

dialogue type : %--
C :  But any so that e e

dialogue type : sj
C :  It 's clear , then , I think .

dialogue type : s
C :  Actually , roughly starting uh let 's say , nex next meeting , cuz this meeting we have one other thing to tie up besides the trip report .

dialogue type : fh|s^cc.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh . I mean there are a lot of issues ,

dialogue type : s:qw
C :  what 's the ontology look like ,

dialogue type : s:qw
C :  you know what do the constructions look like ,

dialogue type : s:qw
C :  what 's the execution engine look like ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  mmm lots of things .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , more focused on uh an idealized version than just getting the demo out .

dialogue type : s^tc.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^fe
C :  Oh !

dialogue type : s
C :  But , it 's still , I think , useful for you to understand the demo version enough , so that you can can see what what it is that that uh it might eventually get retro - fitted into or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  And Johno 's already done that , uh , looked at the dem uh the looked at the SmartKom stuff .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , the parser , and that stuff .

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  OK . Anyway .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^t
C :  the last we we sort of interrupted you guys telling us about what happened last week .

dialogue type : s
C :  Maybe you 're done , then .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  Anyth - any other uh repo visit reports sort of stories ?

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  uh we so we now know I think , what the landscape is like .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  And so we just push on and and uh , do what we need to do .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  And one of the things we need to do is the um , and this I think is relatively tight tightly constrained , is to finish up this belief - net stuff .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s^t^tc
C :  Uh . And I was going to switch to start talking about that unless there 're m other more general questions .

dialogue type : fh|sj
C :  OK so here 's where we are on the belief - net stuff as far as I understand it .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um . Going back I guess two weeks ago uh Robert had laid out this belief - net , missing only the connections .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  That is So , he 'd put all th all the dots down ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and we went through this , and , I think , more or less convinced ourselves that at least the vast majority of the nodes that we needed for the demo level we were thinking of , were in there .

dialogue type : sj
C :  Yeah we may run across one or two more .

dialogue type : s
C :  But of course the connections weren't .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  So , uh Bhaskara and I went off and looked at some technical questions about were certain operations sort of legitimate belief - net computations and was there some known problem with them or had someone already uh , solved you know how to do this and stuff .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And so Bhaskara tracked that down .

dialogue type : s
C :  The answer seems to be uh , " no , no one has done it , but yes it 's a perfectly reasonable thing to do if that 's what you set out to do " .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  And , so the current state of things is that , again , starting now , um we 'd like to actually get a running belief - net for this particular subdomain done in the next few weeks .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  So Bhaskara is switching projects as of the first of June ,

dialogue type : fh|sj
C :  and uh , he 's gonna leave us an inheritance , which is a uh hopefully a belief - net that does these things .

dialogue type : s
C :  And there 're two aspects to it , one of which is , you know , technical ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  getting the coding right , and making it run , and uh stuff like that .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And the other is the actual semantics .

dialogue type : fh|qw
C :  OK ? What all you know , what are the considerations and how and what are the ways in which they relate .

dialogue type : s
C :  So he doe h he doesn't need help from this group on the technical aspects or if he does uh we 'll do that separately .

dialogue type : s
C :  But in terms of what are the decisions and stuff like that , that 's something that we all have to work out .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
C :  Is is that right ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  I mean that 's that 's both you guys ' understanding of where we are ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s^aap
C :  Yeah I mean , that 's a separate problem .

dialogue type : s
C :  We do in the long run wanna do better visualization and all that stuff .

dialogue type : sj
C :  That 's separable ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  Not not at this point .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah . If you know it 's paying a thousand dollars or something we can do that .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
C :  So so don't view free as as a absolute constraint .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  And you can ask Kevin .

dialogue type : s^m
C :  Hugin ,

dialogue type : s
C :  yeah that 's free .

dialogue type : h|sj
C :  Uh , it may be free to academics .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  Like I I don't know .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I have a co I have a copy that I l I downloaded .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  So , at one point it was free .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh but yo I noticed people do use Hugin

dialogue type : fh
C :  so um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  HUGIN .

dialogue type : s
C :  And Bhaskara can give you a pointer .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  But paying a lit

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Probably for university , it 's it 's gonna be real cheap anyway .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  But um , you know , if it 's fifty thousand dollars we aren't gonna do it .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I 'm mean , we have no need for that .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  No ,

dialogue type : s
C :  he 's not gonna do that .

dialogue type : s
C :  Doesn't matter .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  Yeah and this is not a crisis that I mean , you do , e everybody who 's a student should , you know do their work , get their c courses all in good shape

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  and and and and then we 'll dig d dig down on this .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well there there there There 're two different things you do .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  One is you design and the other is you learn .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : fh|s^co
C :  So uh what we 're gonna do initially is is do design , and , i if you will , guess .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh that is you know use your best knowledge of of the domain to uh , hypothesize what the dependencies are and stuff .

dialogue type : s
C :  If it 's done right , and if you have data then , there are techniques for learning the numbers given the structure

dialogue type : s
C :  and there are even techniques for learning the structure , although that takes a lot more data ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and it 's not as @ @ and so forth and so on .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So uh

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  but for the limited amount of stuff we have for this particular exercise I think we 'll just design it .

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  Yeah make yourself a note .

dialogue type : s
C :  So and and , of course Keith would like the German as well as the English ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so whatever you guys can get .

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , the y your native language ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s^j
C :  You remember that one .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  So he 'll get you some data .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh|qy^d^t
C :  so while we 're still at this sort of top level , anything else that we oughta talk about today ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Oh right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : qw
C :  how much is that used in German ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  So , where is this huge project ?

dialogue type : b^rt
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Well , that may be another thing that Keith wants to look at .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  No , it 's not .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : b
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : sj^ba
C :  Great .

dialogue type : s
C :  No , I 've not seen that .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So that would be " origin " in English ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
C :  Alright .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Yeah , it sounds like it ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  doesn't it ,

dialogue type : b
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I see this is this is getting into Ami 's thing .

dialogue type : s
C :  He 's he 's very interested in that .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh . Yeah .

dialogue type : qw
C :  Well , why don't you just put it on the web page ?

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Or a link to it .

dialogue type : %-
C :  Just

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Maybe just put a link on .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  By the way , there something that I didn't know until about a week ago or so , is apparently , there are separate brain areas for things within reach , and things that are out of reach .

dialogue type : s
C :  So there 's there 's uh all this linguistic stuff about you know , near and far , or yon and and so forth .

dialogue type : s
C :  So this is all This is There 's this linguistic facts .

dialogue type : sj
C :  But apparently , the Uh . Here 's the way the findings go .

dialogue type : s
C :  That , you know they do MRI , and and if you 're uh got something within reach then there 's one of your areas lights up ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and if something 's out of reach uh a different one .

dialogue type : sj^ba
C :  But here 's the the amazing result , um , they say .

dialogue type : s
C :  You get someone with a with a deficit so that they have a perfectly normal ability at distance things .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  So the s typical task is subdivision .

dialogue type : s:qw
C :  So there 's a a line on the wall over there , and you give them a laser pointer , and you say , " Where 's the midpoint ? "

dialogue type : s
C :  And they do fine .

dialogue type : s
C :  If you give them the line , and they have to touch it ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  they can't .

dialogue type : s
C :  There 's just that part of the brain isn't functioning , so they can't do that .

dialogue type : s
C :  Here 's the real experiment .

dialogue type : s:qw
C :  The same thing on the wall , you give them a laser , " where is it ? " ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  they do it .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  Give them a stick , long stick , and say " do it " ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  they can't do it .

dialogue type : s
C :  So there 's a remapping of distant space into nearby space .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  It 's not within reach and you use the Within - Reach uh , mechanism .

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  So I 'll d I 'll dig you up this reference .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  First of all , it explains something that I 've always wondered about

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  and I 'll do this this test on you guys as well .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh . How - I have had an experience , not often , but a certain number of times , when , for example , I 'm working with a tool , a screwdriver or something , for a long time , I start feeling the tip directly .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Not indirectly ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but you actually can feel the tip .

dialogue type : s
C :  And people who are uh accomplished violinists and stuff like that , claim they also have this kind of thing where you get a direct sensation of , physical sensation , of the end affector .

dialogue type : qw^br^d^rt
C :  Huh ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : qw^br^d^rt
C :  Huh ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  right .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Have you hav y h had this ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Oh i it feels like your as if your uh neurons had extended themselves out to this tool , and you 're feeling forces on it and so forth

dialogue type : s
C :  and and you deal directly with it .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right , yeah yeah yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah , right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right ,

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
C :  Yeah , so anyway , so So this was the first actual experimental evidence I 'd seen that was consistent with this anecdotal stuff .

dialogue type : s
C :  And of course it makes a lovely def uh story about why languages uh , make this distinction .

dialogue type : s
C :  Of course there are behavioral differences too .

dialogue type : s
C :  Things you can reach are really quite different than things you can't .

dialogue type : s
C :  But there seems to be an actu really deep embodied neural difference .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  So . In addition to the e

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah uh exactly .

dialogue type : s
C :  So in addition to e ego and allocentric uh which appear all over the place , you also apparently have this proximal - distal thing which is very deeply uh embedded .

dialogue type : %
C :  S

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well there 's there 's uh been a lot of behavioral things o on this , but that was the first neur neuro - physiological thing I saw .

dialogue type : s^cc^tc
C :  Anyway yeah , so we 'll we 'll look at this .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And . So , all of these issues now are now starting to come up .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , now we 're now done with demos .

dialogue type : s
C :  We 're starting to do science ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And so these issues about uh , reference , and spatial reference , discourse reference , uh - uh - uh - uh all this sort of stuff , uh , deixis which is part of what you were talking about ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  um So , all of this stuff is coming up essentially starting now .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  So we gotta do all this .

dialogue type : s^t
C :  So there 's that .

dialogue type : s^t
C :  And then there 's also a set of system things that come up .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  So " OK , we 're not using their system . That means we need our system . "

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  It it follows .

dialogue type : fh|s^cc
C :  And so , uh , in addition to the business about just getting the linguistics right , and the formalism and stuff , we 're actually gonna build something

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  and uh , Johno is point person on the parser , analyzer , whatever that is ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  and we 're gonna start on that in parallel with the um , the grammar stuff .

dialogue type : s
C :  But to do that we 're gonna need to make some decisions like ontology ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--:qy.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  There 's a sort of standard way of getting things from ontologies

dialogue type : s
C :  and we build the parser and stuff around that ,

dialogue type : qy
C :  or is there a particular ontology that we 're gonna standardize on , and if so For example , is there something that we can use there .

dialogue type : qy
C :  i Does uh either the uh SmartKom project or one of the projects at EML have something that we can just p pull out , for that .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh , so there are gonna be some some some things like that , which are not science but system .

dialogue type : s
C :  But we aren't gonna ignore those

dialogue type : s^df
C :  cuz we 're we 're not only going The plan is not only to lay out this thing , but to actually uh build some of it .

dialogue type : s
C :  And how much we build , and and so forth .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C :  Uh . Part of it , if it works right , is wh

dialogue type : s
C :  It looks like we 're now in a position that the construction analyzer that we want for this applied project can be the same as the construction analyzer that Nancy needs for the child language modeling .

dialogue type : s
C :  So . It 's always been out of phase

dialogue type : s
C :  but it now seems that um , there 's a good shot at that .

dialogue type : s
C :  So we 've talked about it ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and the hope is that we can make these things the same thing ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and of course it 's only w In both cases it 's only one piece of a bigger system .

dialogue type : s
C :  But it would be nice if that piece were exactly the same piece .

dialogue type : s
C :  It was just this uh construction analyzer .

dialogue type : fh|sj
C :  And so we think we think we have a shot at at that .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So . The for

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  To to come full circle on that , this formalization task ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : s^e.%-
C :  is trying to get the formalism into into a shape where it can actually uh

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  d Well , yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  where it actually is is covers the whole range of things .

dialogue type : s
C :  And the the the the thing that got Mark into the worst trouble is he had a very ambitious thing he was trying to do ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and he insisted on trying to do it with a limited set of mechanisms .

dialogue type : s
C :  It turned out , inherently not to cover the space .

dialogue type : sj
C :  And it just it was just terribly frustrating for him ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  and he seemed fully committed to both sides of this i i irreconcilable thing .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And .

dialogue type : fh|sj
C :  Uh . Johno is much more pragmatic .

dialogue type : qy^br^rt
C :  Uh . Huh ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Is This is true ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  is it not ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  So there 's you know sort of , yeah , deep , really deep , emotional commitment to a certain theory being uh , complete .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  We - well it hasn't it it certainly hasn't been observed , in any case .

dialogue type : fh|sj
C :  Um . Now , you do , but that 's OK .

dialogue type : fh|%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Exactly right .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Exactly .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
C :  Why a actually , uh , the thing is , you you do but , th the thing you have to im implement is so small that Uh .

dialogue type : s^aa^m
C :  Within that ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  yeah ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  and uh , it 's a and still , I think , you know , get something done .

dialogue type : sj
C :  But to try to do something upscale and purist Particularly if if um what you 're purist about doesn't actually work , is real hard .

dialogue type : fh
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^t
C :  And then the other thing is while we 're doing this uh Robert 's gonna pick a piece of this space ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^m
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
C :  uh , for his absentee thesis .

dialogue type : s
C :  I think you all know that that you can just , in Germany almost just send in your thesis .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah right .

dialogue type : s^bk^j
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  It costs a lot .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  The the amount You put in your credit card and as well .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  But anyway ,

dialogue type : fh|s^co
C :  so , uh , that 's um , also gotta be worked out , hopefully over the next few weeks ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  so that that it becomes clear uh , what piece uh , Robert wants to jump into .

dialogue type : s^t
C :  And , while we 're at this level , uh , there 's at least one new doctoral student in computer science who will be joining the project , either next week or the first of August , depending on the blandishments of Microsoft .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
C :  So , de Uh . And her name is Eva .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  It really is .

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  No , first year coming .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , she 's she 's now out here

dialogue type : s
C :  she 's moved ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and she 'll be a student as of then .

dialogue type : s
C :  And probably she 'll pick up from you on the belief - net stuff ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so sh she 'll be chasing you down and stuff like that .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : fh|s^na
C :  Uh , against all traditions .

dialogue type : s
C :  And actually I talked today to a uh undergraduate who wants to do an honors thesis on this .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No ,

dialogue type : sj
C :  interestingly enough .

dialogue type : s^arp
C :  Some of th some of them , yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So anyway ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  uh , but uh she 's another one of these ones with a three point nine average and so forth and so on .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh , so , um , I 've give I 've given her some things to read .

dialogue type : s
C :  So we 'll see how this goes .

dialogue type : s
C :  Oh there 's yet another one of the incoming first incoming first - year graduate students who 's expressed interest ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so we 'll see how that goes .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  anyway ,

dialogue type : fh|s^t
C :  so , I think as far as this group goes , um , it 's certainly worth continuing for the next few weeks to get closure on the uh belief - net and the ideas that are involved in that , and what are th what are the concepts .

dialogue type : s
C :  We 'll see whether it 's gonna make sense to have this be separate from the other bigger effort with the formalization stuff or not ,

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I 'm not sure .

dialogue type : s
C :  It partly depends on w what your thesis turns out to be and how that goes .

dialogue type : s
C :  S so , we 'll see .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  And then , Ami , you can decide , you know , how much time you wanna put into it

dialogue type : s
C :  and uh , it it 's beginning to take shap shape ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so uh and ,

dialogue type : sj
C :  I think you will find that if you want to look technically at some of the your traditional questions in this light , uh Keith , who 's buil building constructions , will be quite happy to uh see what , you know , you envision as the issues and the problems and um , how they might uh get reflected in constructions .

dialogue type : sj
C :  I suspect that 's right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  fine .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
C :  And , um , if it 's useful we can probably arrange for you to drop by and visit either at Heidelberg or at the German AI center , while you 're in in the neighborhood .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : %--
C :  E o do y

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  We 'll we 'll go through this ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  ICSI and EPFL , which is the , uh It 's the Fr

dialogue type : s
C :  Ge - Germany 's got two big technical institutes .

dialogue type : s
C :  There 's one in in Zurich ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  E T

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and then there 's one , the French speaking one , in Lausanne ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which is uh E P

dialogue type : s^co
C :  F L . So find out who they are associated with in Geneva .

dialogue type : sj
C :  Probably we 're connected to them .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Yeah , so , and and if there is a book , that you 'll be building up some audience for it .

dialogue type : s
C :  And you 'll get feedback from these guys .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Cuz they 've actually these DFKI guys have done as much as anyone over the last decade in trying to build them .

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  So we 'll set that up .

dialogue type : fh
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  So , how about if you two guys between now and next week come up with something that is partially proposal , and partially questions ,

dialogue type : s^e:s
C :  saying " here 's what we think we understand , here are the things we think we don't understand " .

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  And that we as a group will try to to finish it .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  What I 'd like to do is shoot f for finishing all this next Monday .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : sj
C :  I don't think we 're gonna get lots more information .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's a design problem .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : h
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  And let 's come up with a first cut at what this should look like . And then finish it up .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Does that so make sense ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
C :  Oh . is it a take - home final ?

dialogue type : qw
C :  Who 's doing this ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah , figured .

dialogue type : s
C :  That would have been i my guess .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um , But anyway , yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
C :  OK , so I guess that 's

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  right .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  So let 's do this ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  and then we we well there 's gonna be some separate co

dialogue type : s
C :  these guys are talking ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  uh we have a group on the formalization ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  uh Nancy and Johno and I are gonna talk about parsers .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : sj
C :  Of course , nothing gets done even in a meeting of seven people ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  So , um , two or three people is the size in which actual work gets done .

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  So we 'll do that .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Great .

dialogue type : s^t
C :  Oh , the other thing we wanna do is catch up with uh , Ellen and see what she 's doing

dialogue type : s^df.%--
C :  because the um image schemas are going to be um , an important pa

dialogue type : s
C :  We we want those ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  And we want them formalized and stuff like that .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  So let me let me make a note to do that .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Oh right !

dialogue type : s^aa^r
C :  Right right right !

dialogue type : sj^ba
C :  That 's great !

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , I I Shweta mentioned that , although she said it 's a secret .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  Th - the faculty aren't faculty aren't supposed to know .

dialogue type : fh
C :  But um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :
