dialogue type : z
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  so , yeah , the this past week I 've been main mainly occupied with , um , getting some results , u from the SRI system trained on this short Hub - five training set for the mean subtraction method .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I ran some tests last night .

dialogue type : fh
C :  But , um ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  c

dialogue type : s
C :  the results are suspicious .

dialogue type : fh|s^df
C :  Um , it 's , um , cuz they 're the baseline results are worse than , um , Andreas than results Andreas got previously .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
C :  That 's on digits .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  It c it it could h it could have something to do with , um , downsampling .

dialogue type : s^ba^cs
C :  That 's that 's worth looking into .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  d and , um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  ap ap apart from that , I guess the the main thing I have t ta I have to talk is , um , where I 'm planning to go over the next week .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I 've been working on integrating this mean subtraction approach into the SmartKom system .

dialogue type : s
C :  And there 's this question of , well , so , um , in my tests before with HTK I found it worked it worked the best with about twelve seconds of data used to estimate the mean ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  but , we 'll often have less in the SmartKom system .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I think we 'll use as much data as we have at a particular time ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and we 'll we 'll concatenate utterances together , um , to get as much data as we possibly can from the user .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  But , um , there 's a question of how to set up the models . So um , we could train the models .

dialogue type : s
C :  If we think twelve seconds is ideal we could train the models using twelve seconds to calculate the mean , to mean subtract the training data .

dialogue type : s
C :  Or we could , um , use some other amount .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  So like I did an experiment where I , um , was using six seconds in test ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  um , but , for I tried twelve seconds in train .

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm a I tried six seconds in train .

dialogue type : s
C :  And six seconds in train was about point three percent better .

dialogue type : fh|s^no
C :  Um , and um , it 's not clear to me yet whether that 's something significant .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I wanna do some tests and , um , actually make some plots of , um for a particular amount of data and test what happens if you vary the amount of data in train .

dialogue type : s
C :  y s so I was I actually ran the experiments mostly

dialogue type : s
C :  and I I was I was hoping to have the plots with me today .

dialogue type : s
C :  I just didn't get to it .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  yeah , I wou I would be curious about people 's feedback on this

dialogue type : s^df
C :  cuz I 'm @ @ I p I think there are some I think it 's it 's kind of like a a bit of a tricky engineering problem .

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm trying to figure out what 's the optimal way to set this up .

dialogue type : fh|s^cc
C :  So , um , I 'll try to make the plots and then put some postscript up on my on my web page .

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  And I 'll mention it in my status report if people wanna take a look .

dialogue type : %--
C :  w Well , it c

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  I I don't think it it 's just for any mismatch you take a hit .

dialogue type : s
C :  i In some cases it might be u better to have a mismatch .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Like I think I saw something like like if you only have two seconds in test , or , um , maybe it was something like four seconds , you actually do a little better if you , um , train on six seconds than if you train on four seconds .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but the case , uh with the point three percent hit was using six seconds in test , um , comparing train on twelve seconds versus

dialogue type : s
C :  The train on twelve seconds .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Huh .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  That 's that 's interesting .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Alright , the e uh , I see your point .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I guess I was thinking of it as , um , an interesting research problem .

dialogue type : s
C :  The how to g I was thinking that for the ASRU paper we could have a section saying , " For SmartKom , we we d in we tried this approach in , uh , interactive system " , which I don't think has been done before .

dialogue type : s
C :  And and then there was two research questions from that .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And one is the k does it still work if you just use the past history ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Alright ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and the other was this question of , um what I was just talking about now .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I guess that 's why I thought it was interesting .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b
C :  um .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , o Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So that 's that 's that 's standard .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
C :  And , um ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  Let 's l let 's see .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  And then there 's um , another thing I wanna start looking at , um , wi is , um , the choice of the analysis window length .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I 've just been using two seconds

dialogue type : s^df
C :  just because that 's what Carlos did before .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh , I wrote to him asking about he chose the two seconds .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it seemed like he chose it a bit informally .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  with the with the HTK set - up I should be able to do some experiments , on just varying that length ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  say between one and three seconds , in a few different reverberation conditions ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
C :  um , say this room and also a few of the artificial impulse responses we have for reverberation ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  just , um , making some plots and seeing how they look .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And , um ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so ,

dialogue type : s
C :  with the the sampling rate I was using , one second or two seconds or four seconds is at a power of two um , number of samples

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  and , um , I 'll I 'll jus f for the ones in between I guess I 'll just zero - pad .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Uh , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  I don't I don't think the TI - digits data that I have , um , i is would be appropriate for that .

dialogue type : qw^cs
C :  But what do you What about if I w I fed it through some kind of , um , speech processing algorithm that changed the speech rate ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  Well , uh , just if you think it 's worth looking into .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I mean , it it is getting a little away from reverberation .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  And and th the third thing , um , uh , is , um , Barry explained LDA filtering to me yesterday .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And so , um , Mike Shire in his thesis um , did a a series of experiments , um , training LDA filters in d on different conditions .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  for this mean subtraction approach ?

dialogue type : qy
C :  Is is that right ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Or for these long analysis windows , I guess , is the right way to put it .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Huh .

dialogue type : fg
C :  o OK .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  a actually I was just thinking about what I was asking about earlier , wi which is about having less than say twelve seconds in the SmartKom system to do the mean subtraction .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  You said in systems where you use cepstral mean subtraction , they concatenate utterances

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  and , do you know how they address this issue of , um , testing versus training ?

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  um ,

dialogue type : fh|qw
C :  and , um , so so in tha in that case , wh what do they do when they 're t um , performing the cepstral mean subtraction on the training data ?

dialogue type : s^df
C :  So because you 'd have hours and hours of training data .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  So do they cut it off and start over ?

dialogue type : s^e^rt
C :  At intervals ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  Or ?

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  Oh , well , no .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  I guess not .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  So if someone 's interacting with the system , though , uh , Morgan uh , Morgan said that you would tend to , um , chain utterances together

dialogue type : fh
C :  um , r

dialogue type : b
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  I g I guess the question I had was , um , amount of data e u was the amount of data that you 'd give it to , um update this estimate .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Because say you if you have say five thousand utterances in your training set , um , and you you keep the mean from the last utterance ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : %
C :  g s

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so you 'd you and so in training you would start over at at every new phone call or at every new speaker .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  R right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see .

dialogue type : s
C :  Bec - because I so this SmartKom task first off , it 's this TV and movie information system .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk^r
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I I see .

dialogue type : s:qw
C :  I was I was about to say . So if if you ask it " What what movies are on TV tonight ? " ,

dialogue type : s
C :  if I look at my wristwatch when I say that it 's about two seconds .

dialogue type : s
C :  The way I currently have the mean subtraction , um , set up , the the analysis window is two seconds .

dialogue type : s
C :  So what you just said , about what do you start with , raises a question of what do I start with then ?

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  And I I g I guess I s just started thinking of another question ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which is , for for the very first frame , w what what do I do

dialogue type : s
C :  if I 'm if I take if I use that frame to calculate the mean , then I 'm just gonna get n nothing .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^bu^cs
C :  so I should probably have some kind of default mean for the first f couple of frames ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
C :  Or subtract nothing .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  And and that 's that 's I guess that 's something that 's p people have figured out how to deal with in cepstral mean subtraction as well ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  So that was all I had , for now .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .
