dialogue type : z
G :  Make sure to turn your microphone on .

dialogue type : z
G :  There 's a battery .

dialogue type : z
G :  OK .

dialogue type : z
G :  Your channel number 's already on this blank sheet .

dialogue type : z
G :  So you just

dialogue type : z
G :  The gai the gain 's up at it what it usually is ,

dialogue type : z
G : 

dialogue type : z
G :  Yeah . It 's sort of a default .

dialogue type : z
G :  But I can set it higher if you like .

dialogue type : z
G :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^na
G :  Well , we started recording , but Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Since we 're starting late I figured we 'd better just start .

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Well , we were gonna do a mock - up , like , question answering or something , I thought ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
G :  that was totally separate from the interface .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Do you remember ?

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  Remember , like , asking questions and retrieving , but in a pre - stored fashion .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^co^t3
G :  Come on in .

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  You like these .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK , good .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
G :  No . That was all , um , previously here .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  I was writing the digits and then I realized I could xerox them ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because I didn't want people to turn their heads from these microphones .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s
G :  We all , by the way , have the same digit form , for the record .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's just cuz I didn't have any more digit sheets .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
G :  I mean , it Actually it might be good to have them separately and have the same exact strings .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  I mean , we could use them for normalizing or something ,

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  but it of course goes more quickly doing them in unison .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
G :  See how long we go .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^j
G :  We 'd be like a chorus .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^co
G :  So you just need to copy over to this one .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  And even The good thing is that since you , um , have high recall , even if you have low precision cuz you 're over - generating , that 's good

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because we could train noise models in the recognizer for these kinds of , uh , transients and things that come from the microphones ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  but I know that if we run recognition unconstrained on a whole waveform , we do very poorly because we 're we 're getting insertions in places what that you may well be cutting out .

dialogue type : s
G :  So we do need some kind of pre - segmentation .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  right now they 're they 're discrete ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  yes or no for a speaker , to consider those particular speaker background models .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s
G :  There 's lots of ins interesting things that could be done .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  That 's a great idea .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh , right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Great .

dialogue type : s^j
G :  Well , they won't hear this since they 're going . They won't be transcribing this meeting .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
G :  It 'd be great , too , if , um , we can we might need some help again getting the tighter boundaries

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  or some hand to experiment with , um you know , to have a ground truth for this segmentation work ,

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  which I guess you have some already that was really helpful , and we could probably use more .

dialogue type : b
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^2
G :  Oh , the new ones

dialogue type : s^2^e
G :  with the tighter boundaries . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  That 's great .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Is there actually a record of where they change ?

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^df.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  I mean , if we keep a old copy of the old time marks

dialogue type : s^df
G :  just so that if we run it we know whether we 're which ones were cheating

dialogue type : %-
G :  and

dialogue type : s
G :  which one would be good .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Mmm , that 's great .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Yeah . As long as we have a record , I guess , of the original automatic one , we can always find out how well we would do fr from the recognition side by using those boundaries .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  You know , a completely non - cheating version .

dialogue type : s^cc.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  I could do it , or Chuck or Adam .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Oh , great .

dialogue type : qh
G :  Well , i if Jane is clarifying question question , then , you know , how can they agree to it before they know her final version ?

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  I mean , with the web interface it 's interesting , because you could allow the person who signs to be informed when their transcript changes ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  or something like that .

dialogue type : s^bd:s
G :  And , I mean , I would say " no " . Like , I don't wanna know ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but some people might be really interested

dialogue type : s
G :  and then y In other words , they would be informed if there was some significant change other than typos and things like that .

dialogue type : s^j^no
G :  Well , I don't know what happened to the small heads thing ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
G : 

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
G :  Anyway . I mean , I agree that at some point people probably won't care about typos but they would care about significant meaning changes

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  and then they could be asked for their consent , I guess , if if those change .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Cuz assumi assuming we we don't really distribute things that have any significant changes from what they sign anyway .

dialogue type : s^fe^nd
G :  Oh , my God .

dialogue type : s^ng.%-
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G :  You you d

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  I I I think

dialogue type : s
G :  that 's a lot to ask for people that have been in a lot of meetings .

dialogue type : b^rt
G :  Well .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  We have eight meetings there

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because we couldn't use the non - native all non - native meetings

dialogue type : s
G :  and it 's , well , probably below threshold on enough data for us for the things we 're looking at

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because the prosodic features are very noisy and so you you need a lot of data in order to model them .

dialogue type : s
G :  Um , so we 're starting to see some patterns

dialogue type : s
G :  and we 're hoping that maybe with , I don't know , double or triple the data with twenty meetings or so , that we would start to get better results .

dialogue type : s
G :  But we did find that some of the features that , I gue Jane would know about , that are expressing sort of the distance of , um , boundaries from peaks in the utterance and some local , um , range pitch range effects , like how close people are to their floor , are showing up in these classifiers ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which are also being given some word features that are cheating , cuz they 're true words .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  Um , so these are based on forced alignment .

dialogue type : s
G :  Word features like , um , word frequency

dialogue type : s
G :  and whether or not something 's a backchannel and so forth .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  So , we 're starting to see , I think , some interesting patterns .

dialogue type : s^am
G :  I think it depends what you 're looking at , a actually .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : h
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^na
G :  spurts is not cheating except that of course you know the real words ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  but roughly speaking , the recognized words are gonna give you a similar type of position .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  It 's either early or late .

dialogue type : s^arp^rt|%-
G :  Not exactly , but i

dialogue type : s^am
G :  Y yeah it should be .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  Well , we don't know

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : b
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G :  You know , uh

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
G :  uh , we didn't try it ,

dialogue type : %-
G :  but it 's s

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2
G : 

dialogue type : s^2^r
G :  speaking rate . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bd
G :  Yeah . That 's actually why I didn't use it at first .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  But we one of the interesting things was

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
G : 

dialogue type : s^e
G :  finding sentence boundaries , finding disfluency boundaries ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and then I had done some work on finding from the foreground speech whether or not someone was likely to interrupt ,

dialogue type : s^e:qy
G :  so where you know , if I 'm talking now and someone and and Andreas is about to interrupt me , is he gonna choose a certain place in my speech , either prosodically or word - based .

dialogue type : s
G :  And there the prosodic features actually showed up

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^e
G :  even though the word features were available .

dialogue type : s^r.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So , I gave everybody a short version of their name .

dialogue type : s
G :  So the real names are in there ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which we couldn't use .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
G :  Uh , we should use I Ds or something .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  And those don't show up .

dialogue type : s^bs
G :  So that means that overall , um , it wasn't just modeling Morgan , or it wasn't just modeling a single person ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  um ,

dialogue type : s
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  the model the tree classifier was trying to find general locations that were applicable to different speakers ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  even though there are huge speaker effects .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s^co
G :  The but the main limitation now is I because we 're only looking at things that happen every ten words or every twenty words , we need more more data and more data per speaker .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s^ba^cs
G :  It 'd also be interesting to look at the EDU meetings

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because we did include meeting type as a feature ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  so

dialogue type : s
G :  whether you were in a r Meeting Recorder meeting or a Robustness meeting did matter to interrupts

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because there are just fewer interrupts in the Robustness meetings .

dialogue type : s
G :  And so the classifier learns more about Morgan than it does about sort of the average person ,

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  which is not bad .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  It 'd probably do better than Um , but it wasn't generalizing .

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  And I think Don , um Well , we have a long list of things he 's starting to look at now over the summer ,

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  And he 'll be able to report on more things in the future .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  But it was great that we could at least go from the you know , Jane 's transcripts and the , uh , recognizer output and get it to this point .

dialogue type : s^cs
G : 

dialogue type : s:s
G :  like , " yeah , we 're at the point where we 're training these classifiers

dialogue type : s
G :  and we 're just reporting very preliminary but suggestive results that some features , both word and pro prosodic , work . "

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  The other thing that was interesting to me is that the pitch features are better than in Switchboard .

dialogue type : s
G :  And I think that really is from the close - talking mikes ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  cuz the pitch processing that was done has much cleaner behavior than than the Switchboard telephone bandwidth .

dialogue type : h|s^ba
G :  Um . Well , first of all , the pitch tracks are m have less , um , halvings and doublings than than Switchboard

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  and there 's a lot less dropout ,

dialogue type : s
G :  so if you ask how many regions where you would normally expect some vowels to be occurring are completely devoid of pitch information ,

dialogue type : s
G : 

dialogue type : s^e.%--
G :  for for , you know , five word

dialogue type : s
G :  there are much fewer than in Switchboard .

dialogue type : s
G :  So the missing We had a big missing data problem in Switchboard

dialogue type : s
G :  and , so the features weren't as reliable

dialogue type : s^df
G :  cuz they were often just not available .

dialogue type : s
G :  So that 's actually good .

dialogue type : s^am|s
G :  Ma - maybe . I mean , the tele we had telephone bandwidth for Switchboard

dialogue type : s
G :  and we had the an annoying sort of telephone handset movement problem that I think may also affect it .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  So we 're just getting better signals in in this data .

dialogue type : s
G :  Which is nice .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s^tc|s^ba
G :  Anyway , Don 's been doing a great job

dialogue type : s
G :  and we hope to continue with , um , Andreas 's help and also some of Thilo 's help on this ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  to to try to get a non - cheating version of how all this would work .

dialogue type : qy^br^rt
G :  Deletions ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
G :  Wait . So you mean you improve one percent over a system that doesn't have any V T L in it already ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|qw.%-
G :  Yeah . Why did that cha ?

dialogue type : b
G :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
G :  There was a like a hum or some or when they recorded it ?

dialogue type : qrr.%-
G :  Or just ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Huh .

dialogue type : b
G :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  eh , and also they 're not I mean , as I understand it , you you don't have a way to optimize the features for the final word error .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bd
G :  I mean , these are just discriminative ,

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Mmm , uh Exactly . Exactly .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  So that you can optimize it for the word error .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|%-
G : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Didn't you did you do that already

dialogue type : qrr.%-
G :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
G :  Oh . That makes a lot of sense .

dialogue type : b
G :  Huh .

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Yeah . That makes sense .

dialogue type : s
G :  As you should never do worse .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^tc
G :  We need to close up

dialogue type : s^df
G :  cuz I need to save the data and , um , get a call .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Did people wanna do the digits

dialogue type : qrr
G :  or , um , do them together ?

dialogue type : s^bd^no
G :  I don't know .

dialogue type : qy.%-
G :  Should we just ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  I mean , are we trying to do them in synchrony ?

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  That might be fun .

dialogue type : s^df.x
G :  Adam 's not here , so he 's not here to tell me no .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
G :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^cs^ng
G :  Maybe just whatever people would naturally do ?

dialogue type : s^bd^no
G :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^ba^j
G :  Be harmony .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^fa|s
G :  Sorry . So I set up

dialogue type : s^df^e
G :  and we didn't have enough digit forms

dialogue type : s^e
G :  so I xeroxed the same one seven times .

dialogue type : s^ar
G :  No .
