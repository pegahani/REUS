dialogue type : z
A :  Uh - oh .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  I 've got to move a bunch of furniture .

dialogue type : s^co
A :  Let me see .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , that 's good .

dialogue type : s
A :  You 're alright ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Will that be enough time ?

dialogue type : s
A :  I guess once you get past the bridge that that would be the worst .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Once you get past the turnoff to the Bay Bridge .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Oh , I

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Did you happen to find out anything about the OGI multilingual database ?

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
A :  Oh , they are ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  And so , ideally , what you 'd wanna do is you 'd wanna run it with and without the target language and the training set for a wide range of languages .

dialogue type : s
A :  And that way you can say , " Well , " you know , " we 're gonna build it for what we think are the most common ones " ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but if that somebody uses it with a different language , you know , " here 's what 's you 're l here 's what 's likely to happen . "

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know anything about Finnish .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  Resistance is futile .

dialogue type : qw
A :  So , when you said that you were getting the labels for TIMIT , um , are y what do you mean by that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Were the digits , um , hand - labeled for phones ?

dialogue type : qrr
A :  Or were they those labels automatically derived ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I was just wondering because that test you 're t

dialogue type : s
A :  I I think you 're doing this test because you want to determine whether or not , uh , having s general speech performs as well as having specific speech .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so I was just wondering if the fact that TIMIT you 're using the hand - labeled stuff from TIMIT might be confuse the results that you get .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df
A :  Right , but if it 's better , it may be better because it was hand - labeled .

dialogue type : b.%
A :  Yeah . OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : qw
A :  What about the differences in the phone sets ?

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
A :  No , between TIMIT and the the digits .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  Out of that fifty - six ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and I think some of them , they were making distinctions between silence at the end and silence at the beginning ,

dialogue type : s
A :  when really they 're both silence .

dialogue type : s
A :  I th I think it was things like that that got it mapped down to fifty - six .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  There 's not much difference , really .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the ones that are gone , I think are I think there was they also in TIMIT had like a glottal stop ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  which was basically a short period of silence ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  and so .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : qw
A :  What about mel cepstrum ?

dialogue type : qy.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  you don't include that because it 's part of the base or something ?

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  It 'd be an interesting test just to have just to do MFCC with the neural net

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and everything else the same .

dialogue type : s^cs^e
A :  Compare that with just M - MFCC without the the net .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  Where did th where did that come from ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  Digits ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is that Was that distributed with Aurora ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
A :  or ?

dialogue type : qw.%-
A :  Where did that ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  What about TI - digits ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh . Oh OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Ah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : qw^cs
A :  What about combinations of things ?

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  Well , you just select multiple things on the one dimension .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  When you do that , you 're increasing the size of the inputs to the net .

dialogue type : qy
A :  Do you have to reduce the hidden layer , or something ?

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No , no ,

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  I 'm I 'm just wondering about number of parameters in the net .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
A :  Do you have to worry about keeping that the same ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
A :  or ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  But wh what about a net that 's trained on multiple languages , though ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
A :  Is that just separate nets for each language then combined ,

dialogue type : qrr
A :  or is that actually one net trained on ?

dialogue type : s^2^bu
A :  In one net .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^arp^bu|qy^d^g^rt
A :  Depends on the corpuses , right ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is it faster to do it on the SPERT ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
A :  or ?

dialogue type : qh^bk^rt
A :  Is it ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bs
A :  So you 're just having a problem converting the labels .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  Nuh - uh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^no.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qy.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bs
A :  you said Nutmeg

dialogue type : qw^bu^rt
A :  and what was the other one ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
A :  Mustard .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right , right .

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  Well , I 'll check on that .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  What you can do , when you 're on that machine , is , uh , just go to the slash - scratch directory , and do a DF minus K ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and it 'll tell you if there 's space available .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  So there 's the slash - X - whatever disks , and then there 's slash - scratch .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  And both of those two kinds are not backed up .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  And if it 's called " slash - scratch " , it means it 's probably an internal disk to the machine .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  And so that 's the kind of thing where , like if um , OK , if you don't have an NT , but you have a a a Unix workstation , and they attach an external disk , it 'll be called " slash - X - something " uh , if it 's not backed up

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and it 'll be " slash - D - something " if it is backed up .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  And if it 's inside the machine on the desk , it 's called " slash - scratch " .

dialogue type : s
A :  But the problem is , if you ever get a new machine , they take your machine away .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's easy to unhook the external disks ,

dialogue type : s
A :  put them back on the new machine ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but then your slash - scratch is gone .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , you don't wanna put anything in slash - scratch that you wanna keep around for a long period of time .

dialogue type : s
A :  But if it 's a copy of , say , some data that 's on a server , you can put it on slash - scratch

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because , um , first of all it 's not backed up ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  and second it doesn't matter if that machine disappears and you get a new machine

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because you just recopy it to slash - scratch .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  So tha that 's why I was saying you could check slash - scratch on those on on , um , Mustard and and Nutmeg to see if if there 's space that you could use there .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  You could also use slash - X - whatever disks on Mustard and Nutmeg .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : %--
A :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  yeah ,

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  yeah , it 's better to have things local if you 're gonna run over them lots of times so you don't have to go to the network .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Uh , is this the appropriate time to talk about the disk space stuff ?

dialogue type : s
A :  I 've started looking at , um , disk space .

dialogue type : s
A :  Dan David , um , put a new , um , drive onto Abbott , that 's an X disk ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  which means it 's not backed up .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um , I 've been going through and copying data that is , you know , some kind of corpus stuff usually , that that we 've got on a CD - ROM or something , onto that new disk to free up space on other disks .

dialogue type : s
A :  And , um , so far , um , I 've copied a couple of Carmen 's , um , databases over there .

dialogue type : s
A :  We haven't deleted them off of the slash - DC disk that they 're on right now in Abbott ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  uh , but we I would like to go through sit down with you about some of these other ones and see if we can move them onto , um , this new disk also .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  There 's there 's a lot more space there ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  and it 'll free up more space for doing the experiments and things .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , anything that that you don't need backed up , we can put on this new disk .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Um , but if it 's experiments and you 're creating files and things that you 're gonna need , you probably wanna have those on a disk that 's backed up , just in case something goes wrong .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um

dialogue type : s
A :  So far I 've I 've copied a couple of things ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but I haven't deleted anything off of the old disk to make room yet .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and I haven't looked at the any of the Aurora stuff ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  except for the Spanish .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  So I I guess I 'll need to get together with you and see what data we can move onto the new disk .

dialogue type : s
A :  I think that would be a I think that 's a big big deal .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Because the you know , the thing that Sunil was talking about , uh , with the labels , uh , labeling the database when it got to the noisy stuff ?

dialogue type : s^df
A :  The That that really throws things off .

dialogue type : s
A :  You know , having the noise all of a sudden , your your , um , speech detector ,

dialogue type : s^bsc.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qw
A :  What was it ?

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  What was happening with his thing ?

dialogue type : s
A :  He was running through these models very quickly .

dialogue type : s
A :  He was getting lots of , uh , uh insertions , is what it was ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  in his recognitions .

dialogue type : qo^cs^rt
A :  What about training up a , um , a multilingual net ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  Another year .

dialogue type : s
A :  So you 'd have to create a mapping from each language to the superset .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  It uses special diacritics and stuff , which you can't do with ASCII characters .

dialogue type : s
A :  So the SAMPA 's just mapping those .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  So they just throw the speech from all different languages together ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  then cluster it into sixty or fifty or whatever clusters ?

dialogue type : s^2
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qr^d.%-
A :  Automatically derived broad classes , or ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  So you 're saying that there may not be enough information coming out of the net to help you discriminate the words ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu.%--
A :  So the targets of the net are these ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^m^na
A :  Articulatory features .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  But that implies that you can have more than one on at a time ?

dialogue type : fh
A :  Ah .

dialogue type : fh
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  We could do an interesting cheating experiment with that too .

dialogue type : s^cs^e
A :  We could I don't know , if you had uh the phone labels , you could replace them by their articulatory features

dialogue type : s^cs^e
A :  and then feed in a vector with those uh , things turned on based on what they 're supposed to be for each phone

dialogue type : s^e
A :  to see if it if you get a big win .

dialogue type : qy^f^rt
A :  Do you know what I 'm saying ?

dialogue type : h
A :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  um ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  well , it 's gonna have probabilities ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but let 's say that they were ones and zeros ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  then y and you know for each ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  um ,

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know if you know this for your testing data ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but if you know for your test data , you know , what the string of phones is and and you have them aligned , then you can just instead of going through the net , just create the vector for each phone and feed that in

dialogue type : s^e
A :  to see if that data helps .

dialogue type : s
A :  Eh , eh , what made me think about this is , I was talking with Hynek and he said that there was a guy at A T - andT who spent eighteen months working on a single feature .

dialogue type : s^e.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : b
A :  right .

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
A :  And they they had done a cheating experiment or something , right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Well , Hynek said that that , I guess before they had him work on this , they had done some experiment where if they could get that one feature right , it dramatically improved the result .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  So I was thinking , you know it made me think about this ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  that if it 'd be an interesting experiment just to see , you know , if you did get all of those right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then you also don't know what error they 've got on the HTK side .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  You know ?

dialogue type : s
A :  It sort of gives you your the best you could hope for , kind of .
