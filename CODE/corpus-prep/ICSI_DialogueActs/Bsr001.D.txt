D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  But the but the worst the worst case is Politically Incorrect where they don't really make any adjustments at all .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : s^bk^t3|s^t3
D :  OK , you guys are more in business that I am .

dialogue type : s
D :  My feeling is that when I when I when I 've seen that show it 's like there there are sometimes people who totally take over the floor

dialogue type : s
D :  and other people are trying to get in , and they can never never get access .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  It depends very much on the mix .

dialogue type : s
D :  Yeah , it 's just , I I know that there are periods where two people are talking in t at the same time

dialogue type : s
D :  and you 're only able to hear um , parts of the weaker voice .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , you know , that 's It 's a style .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  What I can do is say , la - la - la - la - la - la - la - la - la .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  I know ,

dialogue type : s^cs^j
D :  but we can blend it for the public .

dialogue type : %
D :  Uh .

D :  So is is it the same three people each time or a different three people ?

dialogue type : b
D :  OK , OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  That 's good .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm , hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , the other thing too is , I mean , i if if you have the equipment then , i i it could be different .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Then the recording is easy

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'd give you my mike .

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : qy^rt

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  There we go .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Is it is it gonna be like an HPSG kind of grammar ?

dialogue type : s^bk.%
D :  I see .

dialogue type : qy^j^rt
D :  Is is Morgan nodding his head ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  Well , he could be reached he could be reached by the far field ,

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
D :  couldn't he ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^tc
D :  I wanted to ask one question about the the nature of the design .

dialogue type : qy^cs^df
D :  Th - Given that the overlaps are up up uh , where the difficulty comes , in a bunch of a areas , um , whether it would be useful to have some of the sessions have like an additional rule

dialogue type : s^e.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^df
D :  so you then you have the meeting context ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  you have multiple channels ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  you have the microphones n varying the way you want them to vary ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  but you 'd cut down substantially on the overlaps .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  It wouldn't be f for all meetings

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  but whether maybe just sprinkled through there once in a while , something like that might be useful or not .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Just wanted to raise that .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , what I can say is that wha sometimes , you know , if if if we were to have this kind of coordination thing , some some of the overlap is due to someone wanting to claim the floor at a certain point

dialogue type : s^e
D :  without knowing that other people have the same desire at the same point in time .

dialogue type : s:s^co
D :  And if and if you were to have someone who was like a moderator , then you raise your hand , the moderator would say , you first ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  you know ,

dialogue type : s:s^bk
D :  or yeah ,

dialogue type : s:s^co
D :  press the button .

dialogue type : s
D :  And and I think , you know , there are always gonna be backchannels ,

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  I think that 's natural and lovely .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  But these these overlaps that are due to people n not knowing other people wanna leap in at the same time and and wanting to coordinate you know , I think that , uh , it could be lessened .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Not eliminated entirely .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  And they 've been collecting digits too .

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  That 's a good idea .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  That 's a good idea .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  That 's right ,

dialogue type : s
D :  this we could each make up a string .

dialogue type : s^j
D :  I know the numbers that were used

dialogue type : s^j
D :  but I don't remember the combinations .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  We could do some digits .

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's what I was wondering .

dialogue type : s
D :  Ha - wha I mean , we could just make make numbers up ,

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
D :  can't we ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : qy.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  no ,

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^tc
D :  I wanted to ask about also the air conditioning .

dialogue type : qrr
D :  Are uh , is there a plan to to turn the air conditioning off in some of these meetings or is it always gonna be on ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I was just thinking , he was showing it on what he showed us on the web site ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  you could see the contribution of the air conditioning .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I just wondered if that was gonna be sometimes clear .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm , hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
D :  Oh wow ,

dialogue type : s
D :  there you go .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Perfect .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think I recognize those .
