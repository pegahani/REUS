dialogue type : fg|s^t^tc
F :  O K . So , here we are .

dialogue type : s^m
F :  Once again ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  right ,

dialogue type : s
F :  together .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Um , so we haven't had a meeting for a while ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and and probably won't have one next week ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I think a number of people are gone .

dialogue type : fh|qh^co^t
F :  Um , so Robert , why don't you bring us up to date on where we are with EDU ?

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Good .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  I think so .

dialogue type : s^ar.%--
F :  Well

dialogue type : s^ar^rt
F :  No .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  So y you didn't yet tell us what the output is .

dialogue type : qw
F :  So what decisions does this make ?

dialogue type : s
F :  So that was pretty quick .

dialogue type : s
F :  She 's ac uh uh Eva 's got a little write - up on it

dialogue type : s
F :  that uh , probably gives the the details to anybody who needs them .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
F :  the You you didn't look at all yet to see if there 's anybody has a implementation .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So one so one of the questions , you know , about these P R Ms is

dialogue type : h|s^cc
F :  uh , we aren't gonna build our own interpreter ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  so if if we can't find one , then we uh , go off and do something else and wait until s one appears .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Uh , so one of the things that Eva 's gonna do over the next few weeks is see if we can track that down .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
F :  the people at Stanford write papers as if they had one ,

dialogue type : fh|s^am
F :  but , um , we 'll see .

dialogue type : s
F :  So w Anyway . So that 's a a major open issue .

dialogue type : s
F :  If there is an interpreter , it looks like you know , what Eva 's got should run

dialogue type : s
F :  and we should be able to actually um , try to solve , you know , the problems ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  to actually take the data , and do it .

dialogue type : fh|s^am
F :  Uh , and we 'll see .

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh , I actually think it is cleaner ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and the ability to instantiate , you know , instance of people and sites and stuff , um , will help in the expression .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  Whether the inference gets any faster or not I don't know .

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh , it wouldn't surprise me if it if it doesn't .

dialogue type : s
F :  You know , it 's the same kind of information .

dialogue type : s
F :  I think there are things that you can express this way which you can't express in a normal belief - net ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
F :  uh , without going to some incredible hacking

dialogue type : s^e
F :  of sort of rebuilding it on the fly .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , the notion of instantiating your el elements from the ontology and stuff fits this very nicely and doesn't fit very well into the extended belief - net .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  So that was one of the main reasons for doing it .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s^tc
F :  I don't know .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
F :  So , uh , people who have thought about the problem , like Robert

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  i it looked to me like if Eva were able to come up with a you know , value for each of a number of uh , sites plus its EVA thing ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  that a travel planner should be able to take it from there .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  And you know , with some other information about how much time the person has and whatever ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and then plan a route .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  That I think was actually in the previous the Ubenth stuff .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I don't remember whether they carried that over to this or not ,

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  uh , structural uncertainty .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Alright .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cc
F :  So , uh , the the plan is is when Daphne gets back , we 'll get in touch

dialogue type : s
F :  and supposedly , um , we 'll actually get s deep seriously connected to to their work

dialogue type : fh
F :  and

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  somebody 'll Uh , you know If it 's a group meeting once a week probably someone 'll go down and , whatever .

dialogue type : s^cc
F :  So , we 'll actually figure all this out .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah . So , um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  you could , from this , go on and say suppose there 's a group of people traveling together

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs^j.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--:s
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  w Exactly .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah . Right .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Anyway .

dialogue type : s
F :  So . So there i there are some some u uh , you know , uh , elaborations of this

dialogue type : s^cs^e
F :  that you could try to put in to this structure ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but I don't think it 's worth it now .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because we 're gonna see what what else uh what else we 're gonna do .

dialogue type : s^tc
F :  Anyway .

dialogue type : fh
F :  But uh ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  it 's good , yeah

dialogue type : s
F :  and and there were a couple other ideas of of uh , things for Eva to look at

dialogue type : s^e
F :  in in the interim .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  On the other hand , uh , FrameNet could well be useful .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  So do you know the FrameNet story ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Oh . Th - that 's another thing you might wanna look into while you 're here .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because , um , you know , the standard story is that keyworks keywords evoke frames , and the frames may well give you additional keywords

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  So there 's a lot of stuff ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and people are looking at that .

dialogue type : s
F :  Most of the work here is just trying to get the frames right .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  There 's linguists and stuff

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and there 's a lot of it

dialogue type : s
F :  and they 're they 're busily working away .

dialogue type : s
F :  But there are some application efforts trying to exploit it .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  And this looks t it seems to be that this is a place where you might be able to do that .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  W yeah , I know , I mean it it he w he did w what what he did was much more s sensible for him .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  I think uh ,

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  The idea was there . Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  So you you guys never sent anybody else from I U .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Uh , this was supposedly an exchange program ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and I we you know , it 's fine . We don't care ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but it just I 'm a little surprised that uh , Andreas didn't come up with anyone else he wanted to send .

dialogue type : b
F :  Alright .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean I had forgotten a I To be honest with you , I 'd totally forgotten we had a program .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  No , no . There was a whole co There was a little contract signed .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah , I know .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^fe
F :  Oh , right !

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Anyway .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Right . So I thi tha that 's that 's one of the things that might be worth looking into while you 're here .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Uh , unfortunately , Srini , who is heavily involved in DAML and all this sort of stuff is himself out of town .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Yeah , for for some reason he 's not doing that .

dialogue type : s^no.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qh
F :  oh , I , who knows ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Anyway , s yeah , you 'll see you 'll certainly see a lot of the people there .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  St - statistical stuff .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That would be a very good idea .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt^t
F :  Alright , was there anything else for this ?

dialogue type : s
F :  One of these times soon we 're gonna hear about construal .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , OK . Right .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
F :  Good thinking !

dialogue type : s^df^ng
F :  Well , no , but he 's he 's he 's he 's as you said , he 's , like the state legislature , he 's trying to offer us bribes .

dialogue type : h|s.%--
F :  Uh , this this this t the s

dialogue type : s
F :  we 're , uh , involved in a literally three hundred million dollar uh , program .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
F :  Uh , with the State of California .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  And , the State of California is now a month and a half behind its legis its legally required date to approve a budget .

dialogue type : s
F :  So the budget has not been approved .

dialogue type : s
F :  And two days ago There 's two l you know , so , two branches of legislature . One branch approved it ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  and , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  yesterdayday there was this uh uh I thought that the other branch would just approve it ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but now there 's actually a little back sliding to people who who approved it got flak from there ,

dialogue type : s
F :  eh anyway .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^cc
F :  Oh ! I have to tell you a wonderful story about this ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  OK ?

dialogue type : s^cc
F :  And then we 'll go .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , I it turns out I wound up having lunch today with a guy named Tom Kalil .

dialogue type : s^e
F : 

dialogue type : s^bsc
F :  KALIL .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  And , uh , he now works at Berkeley .

dialogue type : s
F :  In fact he 's hired to run a lot of CITRIS ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  even though we don't have the money they So they 've been hiring people right and left ,

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  so , uh , they think the money 's coming .

dialogue type : s
F :  So and he was , I think , the chief staffer to Clinton on technology matters .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  He was in the White House ,

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I don't remember what he was saying .

dialogue type : s
F :  A anyway , like that .

dialogue type : s
F :  And , is now doing all the politics for CITRIS ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but also , has a uh , a lot of interest in uh , actually doing things for society ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  so digital divide and stuff like that .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that 's s interesting to me but maybe not to you .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  But the really interesting thing was , he st he s he s said something about , you know I 'm interested in things that have high social multiplier ,

dialogue type : s^e:s
F :  something that is of great social value .

dialogue type : s.%--:s
F :  He said , " for example " ,

dialogue type : s
F :  this was his only example ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  " if you had a adult literacy program that was as good as an individual tutor ,

dialogue type : s^e:s
F :  and as compelling as a video game ,

dialogue type : s^e:s
F :  then that would have a huge social impact " .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  I said , " Oh great ! That 's a good problem to work on . "

dialogue type : fh|s^ba:s
F :  Anyway . So it was nice that uh , he 's got this view , of A , that 's what you should try to do , and B , uh , language would be a good way to do it .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  So anyway , that 's the end of the story .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Yeah . I didn't push him on the ch on the child thing ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but , uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  you know , a again , if if you if you

dialogue type : fh
F :  um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and this was this was literacy ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which actually is somewhat different problem .

dialogue type : s^am
F :  Maybe easier .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Another project we started on , and and didn't get funded for was , uh , to try to build an automatic tutoring program , for kids whose first language wasn't English .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Which is like half the school population in California .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Something like that ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  isn't it ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So ,

dialogue type : s
F :  enormous problem in California ,

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
F :  and the idea was if we 're so smart about language understanding and speech understanding , couldn't we build uh , programs that would be tutors for the kids .

dialogue type : s
F :  We think we could .

dialogue type : s
F :  Anyway . So so But this is a slightly different problem ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  and

dialogue type : fh
F :  um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I know none of us have the spare time to look at it right now ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  but it i it 's it 's interesting

dialogue type : s:qy
F :  and I may um , talk to him some more about is em somebody already doing this , and stuff like that .

dialogue type : s^tc
F :  So anyway , that was that was today 's little story .

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No , no .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  You 're good .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s^ba
F :  Anyway . Yeah , so OK , so that 'd be great ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but I 'd I think it 's it 's time again ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah . OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Good .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  Done ?
