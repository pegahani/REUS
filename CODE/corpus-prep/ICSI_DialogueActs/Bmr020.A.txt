dialogue type : z
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : z
A :  we 're recording .

dialogue type : z
A :  Curly brackets .

dialogue type : z
A :  Right .

dialogue type : z
A :  Do we use square brackets for anything ?

dialogue type : z
A :  It 's still not a good idea .

dialogue type : z
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : z
A :  you wanna

dialogue type : z
A :  noise floors ,

dialogue type : z
A :  through the whole meeting .

dialogue type : z
A :  Change what in the software ?

dialogue type : z
A :  I mean certainly we could do that ,

dialogue type : z
A :  but I don't think that 's a good idea .

dialogue type : z
A :  We can do that in post - processing if if the application needs it .

dialogue type : z
A :  As an argument .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^t
A :  so the only agenda items were Jane was Jane wanted to talk about some of the IBM transcription process .

dialogue type : s
A :  I sort of condensed the three things you said into that .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then just I only have like , this afternoon and maybe tomorrow morning to get anything done before I go to Japan for ten days .

dialogue type : s^co
A :  So if there 's anything that n absolutely , desperately needs to be done , you should let me know now .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well yeah , you sent it in late .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  that was the other thing

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh ,

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  uh , Dave Gelbart sent me email , I think he sent it to you too , that um , there 's a special topic , section in si in Eurospeech on new , corp corpors corpora .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  And it 's not due until like May fifteenth .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  No .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  It 's a different one .

dialogue type : fg
A :  And uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I s forwarded it to Jane as I thought being the most relevant person .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  have you did you look at the URL ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  I 'll help ,

dialogue type : s^arp
A :  but obviously I can't , really do , most of

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  But any any help you need I can certainly provide .

dialogue type : b
A :  Wow .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's just cuz he talks really fast .

dialogue type : %
A :  I know

dialogue type : s
A :  But re well regardless . I think it 's he 's he 's in all of them ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and he talks a lot .

dialogue type : s
A :  One participant .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Did you identify him as a senior member ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  The good , the bad , and the ugly .

dialogue type : s^t3
A :  I 'm surprised .

dialogue type : s
A :  I have I had better start changing all my slides !

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  Yeah , I was gonna ask that too .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  But I don't know if that 's really a fair way of comparing between , multi - party , conversations and two - party conversations .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I I I don't know .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
A : 

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I bet there 's a weak dependence .

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'm sure it 's it 's not a real strong one .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  Because you

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  You have a lot of a lot of two - party , subsets within the meeting .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  it 's an interesting result regardless .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  So , did we all said " uh - huh " and nodded at the same time ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  Nope .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  Oh by the way , who 's on channel four ?

dialogue type : s
A :  You 're getting a lot of breath .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  That 's great .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , I guess that doesn't surprise me ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because , with the close - talking mikes , the the signal will be so much stronger .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  What what sort of normalization do you do ?

dialogue type : s^e
A :  I mean in you recognizer ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  in the SRI recognizer .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  Over an entire utterance ?

dialogue type : qrr^d
A :  Or windowed ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'm not looking forward to it .

dialogue type : s
A :  At pause boundaries .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
A :  On T - closures , only .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's nice to actually measure it though .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  Made the font smaller and the narrows longer .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Took out white space .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
A :  There was there was of course a Monty Python sketch with that .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Where the barber who was afraid of scissors was playing a a tape of clipping sounds , and saying " uh - huh " ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  " yeah " ,

dialogue type : qo^e
A :  " how about them sports teams ? "

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^t3
A :  Printed it out ,

dialogue type : s^t3
A :  haven't read it yet .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Pub real .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
A :  Ask Dan Ellis .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  Beta ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Don't don't don't say .

dialogue type : s
A :  I uh , put digits in my own home directory home FTP directory ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but I 'll probably move them there as well .

dialogue type : s
A :  We can put it in the same place .

dialogue type : s
A :  Just put in another directory .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  OK , I think we 're losing , Don and Andreas at three - thirty ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  It was just to talk about how to generate it .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
A :  Um , just so that while I 'm gone , you can regenerate it if you decide to do it a different way .

dialogue type : s
A :  So uh , Chuck and Thilo should , now more or less know how to generate the file

dialogue type : s
A :  and , the other thing Chuck pointed out is that , um , since this one is hand - marked , there are discourse boundaries .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^e
A :  So so when one person is speaking , there 's breaks .

dialogue type : s
A :  Whereas Thilo 's won't have that .

dialogue type : s
A :  So what what we 're probably gonna do is just write a script , that if two , chunks are very close to each other on the same channel we 'll just merge them .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  So , uh , and that will get around the problem of , the , you know " one word beep , one word beep , one word beep , one word beep " .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's on the other channel .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's because of channel overlap .

dialogue type : %-
A :  It 's i

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean that 's not gonna be true of the foreground speaker .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  That 'll only be if it 's the background speaker .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  That 's what I just said ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  Well , that 's definitely a problem .

dialogue type : s^t3
A :  Battery .

dialogue type : s^co^t3
A :  Let me make a note on yours .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  Yeah the only , um , disadvantage of that is , then it 's hard to use an automatic method to do that .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  The advantage is that it 's probably faster to do that than it is to use the automated method and correct it .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  We 'll just have to see .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^t3
A :  It 's not that different .

dialogue type : s
A :  Transcriber will do it .

dialogue type : s
A :  We pick the easy parts of the data basically ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and transcriber marks it by hand .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , after .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , OK ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I didn't I didn't understand that .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^co
A :  OK , leave the mikes on ,

dialogue type : s^co
A :  and just put them on the table .

dialogue type : s^co^t3
A :  Let me mark you as no digits .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I think we just we just have to listen to it and see how good they are .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Release to begin with .

dialogue type : s^j^nd^t3
A :  No , the undead meeting ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Blech .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Stress test .

dialogue type : s^na^t3
A :  One and a half times real time .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^fa|s^cs
A :  Sorry , go ahead .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  Yeah I I think , we won't know until we generate a bunch of beep files automatically , listen to them and see how bad they are .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  That 's not hard to do .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Just it takes you know , it just takes five minutes rather than , taking a second .

dialogue type : s
A :  So . I just hand hard - coded it .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^df
A :  No , but it 's easy enough to do .

dialogue type : s
A :  There are lots of ways to do it .

dialogue type : s
A :  I have one program that 'll do it .

dialogue type : s
A :  You can find other programs .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  Minus D , capital D .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  I didn't mean listen to everything ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I meant , just see if they 're any good .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  And we should just double - check with Brian on a few simple conventions on how they should mark things .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^na
A :  Yeah , cuz @ @ uh what I had originally said to Brian was well they 'll have to mark , when they can't distinguish between the foreground and background ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because I thought that was gonna be the most prevalent .

dialogue type : s
A :  But if we send them without editing , then we 're also gonna hafta have m uh , notations for words that are cut off ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and other sorts of , uh , acoustic problems .

dialogue type : s
A :  But what what we would like them to do is be conservative

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  so that they should only write down the transcript if they 're sure .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  And otherwise they should mark it so that we can check .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba^na
A :  That 's a good idea .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Or at least sample it .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh

dialogue type : qw
A :  What can you do ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yep . Mmm .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  It 's a little bit confusing .

dialogue type : qh
A :  I mean , what 're we gonna do ?

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bsc^df
A :  a hand - transcriber would have trouble with that .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df
A :  Yeah cuz there will be no channel on which it is foreground .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^nd
A :  Right , but , uh , in general I don't think we want them transcribing the background ,

dialogue type : s^df^nd
A :  cuz that would be too much work .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df.%-
A :  because in the overlap sections , then they 'll

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  But that 's gonna be all over the place .

dialogue type : qw^df
A :  How w how will they tell the difference between that sort of background and the dormal normal background of two people talking at once ?

dialogue type : qw^nd
A :  How would they know that ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Because otherwise it 's gonna be too much work for them to mark it .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  They 'll be marking it all over the place .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Sure ,

dialogue type : qw^nd
A :  but how are they gonna tell bet the difference between that and two people just talking at the same time ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  But how do we d how do we do that for the I B M folks ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  How can they tell that ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes ,

dialogue type : s^na
A :  that 's my opinion as well .

dialogue type : s^co
A :  So we don't do anything for it with it .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  And they 'll just mark it however they mark it ,

dialogue type : s^co^e
A :  and we 'll correct it when it comes back .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^2
A :  the default .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^bsc
A :  No , not default .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  Worry about it when we get back .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  As I say , we 'll just have to listen to it and see how horrible it is .

dialogue type : s^bsc
A :  Sample it , rather .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  and and they 're very it 's very audible ? on the close - talking channels ?

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  Oh well .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , it 's the same problem as the lapel mike .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : qr
A :  Are we gonna do it altogether or separately ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Nnn , yeah ,

dialogue type : z
A :  I think there probably will be .

dialogue type : z
A :  I do .

dialogue type : z
A :  Total concentration . Are you guys ready ?
