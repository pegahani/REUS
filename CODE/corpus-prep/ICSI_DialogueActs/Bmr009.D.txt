dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s
D :  W I mean , what I meant is , even if you use linear , you know , raw measures , like raw energy or whatever ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  maybe we shouldn't make any assumptions about the distribution 's shape ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  and just use you know , use the distribution to model the the mean ,

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : fh

dialogue type : s^cs

dialogue type : s^no

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^cs

dialogue type : s.%-

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Especially locally .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  So . Locally .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  And the other thing is I

dialogue type : s^fa
D :  Sorry .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , especially for normalizing .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  I mean , it 's really important to pick a normalization that matches the distribution for that feature .

dialogue type : s
D :  And it may not be the same for all the types of overlaps or the windows may not be the same .

dialogue type : s
D :  e Actually , I was wondering , right now you 're taking a all of the speech , from the whole meeting , and you 're trying to find points of overlap ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but we don't really know which speaker is overlapping with which speaker ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  right ?

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So I mean another way would just be to take the speech from just , say , Morgan , And just Jane and then just their overlaps ,

dialogue type : s
D :  like but by hand ,

dialogue type : s
D :  by cheating ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  and looking at you know , if you can detect something that way ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because if we can't do it that way , there 's no good way that we 're going to be able to do it .

dialogue type : s
D :  That You know , there might be something helpful and cleaner about looking at just individuals and then that combination alone .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  Plus , I think it has more elegant e

dialogue type : s
D :  The m the right model will be easier to see that way .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  So if I don't know , if you go through and you find Adam , cuz he has a lot of overlaps and some other speaker who also has e enough speech

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  and just sort of look at those three cases of Adam and the other person and the overlaps ,

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  and just look at the distributions , maybe there is a clear pattern

dialogue type : s
D :  but we just can't see it because there 's too many combinations of of people that can overlap .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s
D :  Just seems sort of complex .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  I don't think this is true , but what if

dialogue type : qw^br
D :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : qh.%--
D : 

dialogue type : qh
D :  both people talk more softly ?

dialogue type : s^bd
D :  I don't think this happens at all .

dialogue type : s
D :  Or they get louder .

dialogue type : s^aap.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^rt.%-
D :  I mean .

dialogue type : s
D :  There are there are different types ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  and within those types ,

dialogue type : s
D :  like as Jose was saying , that sounded like a backchannel overlap ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  meaning the kind that 's a friendly encouragement , like " Mm - hmm . " ,

dialogue type : s:sj^ba
D :  " Great ! " ,

dialogue type : s:sj^ba
D :  " Yeah ! "

dialogue type : s
D :  And it doesn't take you don't take the floor .

dialogue type : s
D :  Um , but , some of those , as you showed , I think can be discriminated by the duration of the overlap .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  He 's getting his feet wet and then he 'll be starting again in mid - January .

dialogue type : s
D :  He 's interested in trying to distinguish the types of overlap .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know if he 's talked with you yet .

dialogue type : s
D :  But in sort of honing in on these different types

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So it might be something that we can help by categorizing some of them and then , you know , look at that .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^ar
D :  Yeah , no . I didn't mean that that for you to do that ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  but I was thinking if if Don and I are trying to get categories

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  So you don't have to worry about it .

dialogue type : s
D :  And here 's the three types of overlaps .

dialogue type : s
D :  And we 'll we 'll do the labelling for you .

dialogue type : %-
D :  Um .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Yeah , that we would be working on anyway .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^df.%--
D :  Yeah , no , that was That was a jok

dialogue type : s^df
D :  or a sort of , a case where where you would never know that unless you actually go and look at two individuals .

dialogue type : fg
D :  So .

dialogue type : s
D :  It might the case , though , that the significant energy , just as Jose was saying , comes in the non - backchannel cases .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because in back Most people when they 're talking don't change their own energy when they get a backchannel ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  cuz they 're not really predicting the backchannel .

dialogue type : s
D :  And sometimes it 's a nod and sometimes it 's an " mm - hmm " .

dialogue type : s
D :  And the " mm - hmm " is really usually very low energy .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So maybe those don't actually have much difference in energy .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  But all the other cases might .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , just listen to it .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  Well , it would be lost no matter what you do .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , even if you take the log , you can your model just has a more sensitive measures .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right . Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  That 'd be great .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  Yeah , I remem

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  That would be great .

dialogue type : sj^ba^r
D :  That would be really great .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  You know , basically , we got his environment set up .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  He 's he 's a double - E you know .

dialogue type : s^df^rt
D :  So . It 's mostly that , if we had to label it ourselves , we we would or we 'd have to , to get started ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  but if It it would be much better if you can do it .

dialogue type : sj
D :  You 'd be much better at doing it also

dialogue type : s
D :  because you know , I I 'm not I don't have a good feel for how they should be sorted out ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I really didn't wanna go into that if I didn't have to .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think that 's a research effort in and of itself ,

dialogue type : s
D :  because you can read the literature , but I don't know how it 'll turn out

dialogue type : s
D :  and , You know , it 's always an interesting question .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  That 'd be great .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  That 'd be really great .

dialogue type : s
D :  And we 'd still have some funding for this project ,

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , he we 're not paying him the full RA - ship for all the time .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk^t1
D :  Yeah , definitely .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah , that 's true .

dialogue type : s^bs
D :  The window shouldn't be larger than the backchannel .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well it 's a sliding window ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So if you take the the measure in the center of the overlapped piece , you know , there 'd better be some something .

dialogue type : s
D :  But if your window is really huge then yeah you 're right

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  The portion of the of the backchannel won't won't effect anything .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
D :  So .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  You know , you shouldn't be more than

dialogue type : s
D :  like You should definitely not be three times as big as your as your backchannel .

dialogue type : s
D :  Then you 're gonna w have a wash .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : %-
D :  Yea

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , it depends how different your normalization is , as you slide your window across .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean . That 's something we don't know .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah I was talking about the n normalization window .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  That 's true . Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Um .

dialogue type : sj^ba.%--
D :  But that 'd be great if if you 're marking those

dialogue type : fh
D :  and um .

dialogue type : s
D :  But it is definitely true that we need to have the time marks ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I was assuming that will be inherited because , if you have the words and they 're roughly aligned in time via forced alignment or whatever we end up using , then you know , this student and I would be looking at the time marks

dialogue type : s
D :  and classifying all the frames inside those as whatever labels Jane gave

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't think you need to .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah . That should be linked to the words which are linked to time somehow ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  right ?

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  Not now .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  Well , it 's something that w

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  Well , we we wouldn't be able to do any work without a forced alignment anyway ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  so somehow if once he gets going we 're gonna hafta come up with one

dialogue type : %--
D :  and

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  So whatever you would label would be attached to the words , I think .

dialogue type : s
D :  Cuz there 's there 's a lot of work you can't do without that ,

dialogue type : qh.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  You 'd have to go in and measure every start and stop point next to a word

dialogue type : s
D :  is y if you 're interested in anything to do with words .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s^tc|sj^ba
D :  Anyway So that 'd be great .

dialogue type : qy.%--
D : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Are we supposed to keep recording here ?

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Yeah , me too .

dialogue type : qr.%--
D :  So you should call it , like , " digits start time " . Or .

dialogue type : s
D :  " For official use only "

dialogue type : s^df^rt
D :  That 's Well , he 's very professional .

dialogue type : s
D :  Actually , the only way I know is from working with the database and having to figure it out .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Well yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^am
D :  Probably Western , yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  Actually even if you t

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^no^rt
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
D :  Maybe we can give them a li like a little map ?

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^df
D :  No , I 'm serious .

dialogue type : s^df^rt
D :  Because it takes less time , and it 's sort of cute

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  there 's no figure .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  You know , it doesn't have all the detail ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s
D :  No , but you 're categorized .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^na
D :  I mean I As I said , I don't think there 's a huge benefit to this region thing .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  The problem is that for some things it 's really clear and usually listening to it you can tell right away if it 's a New York or Boston accent ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  well , I guess they have the NYC ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but New England has a bunch of very different dialects

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  and so does um S So do other places .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so these would be satisfying like a speech research community if we released the database ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but as to whether subjects know where they 're from , I 'm not sure because um I know that they had to fill this out for Switchboard .

dialogue type : s
D :  This is i almost exactly the same as Switchboard regions

dialogue type : s
D :  or very close .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um And I don't know how they filled that out .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Yeah , Midland is the one that 's difficult I guess .

dialogue type : s
D :  Also Northwest you 've got Oreg - Washington and Oregon now which uh y people don't know if it 's western or northern .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  It 's like Northwest

dialogue type : s
D :  I think originally it was North Northwest

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , you have a like techno - speak accent I think .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
D :  Yeah , you know ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Well it 's I mean I you can sort of identify

dialogue type : s^rt.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  but but maybe that maybe we could leave this

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  and see what people See what people choose

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean I don't know what else we can do , cuz That 's North Midland .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Well there are hardly any subjects from Idaho .

dialogue type : s^r
D :  There 's only a few people in Idaho .

dialogue type : s^fa^t3
D :  Sorry .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa^m
D :  We could ask where they 're from .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  But - We went back to that .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^f
D :  You know .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right . Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%-

dialogue type : %-

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^no

dialogue type : s^co
D :  So let 's make it up .

dialogue type : qh
D :  S I mean , who cares .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So we can say " Northwest " , " Rest of West " or something .

dialogue type : s^f
D :  You know .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  " West "

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  and I mean .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah , exactly .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's not really a region .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So we could take out " North " " Northern " .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , w It 's In It 's it 's harder in America anywhere else , basically .

dialogue type : s
D :  And those people , if you ask them to self - identify their accent they know .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  They know very well .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  They know they don't speak the same as the

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^e^rt
D :  And that 's actually good .

dialogue type : s
D :  I was I was thinking of something along that line

dialogue type : s^df.%--
D :  because if you don't know , then , you know , ruling out the fact that you 're totally inept or something ,

dialogue type : s
D :  if somebody doesn't know , it probably means their accent isn't very strong compared to the sort of midwest standard .

dialogue type : %-
D :  W

dialogue type : s
D :  Each each one has pros and cons

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : qh
D :  What if we put in both ?

dialogue type : qy.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^ar|qh
D :  No , I mean what if we put in both ways of asking them ?

dialogue type : s^e:s
D :  So . One is Region

dialogue type : s^cs^e^rt:qo
D :  and the another one is " if you had to characterize yourself your accent , what would you say ? "

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Well they might only answer only one of the questions

dialogue type : %--

dialogue type : s^f
D :  You know .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : sj^cs

dialogue type : s^bd^no
D :  But I Cuz I really don't know .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Maybe we can make the list a little smaller .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^2^cs^rt
D :  And keeping " Other " ,

dialogue type : s^cs
