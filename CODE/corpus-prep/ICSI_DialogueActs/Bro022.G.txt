dialogue type : qw
G :  Um , what is the reverberation time like there ?

dialogue type : s^nd
G :  On , uh , the the one what the s in the speech that you are you are using like ?

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh , this room ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw^rt
G :  With the with the HTK back - end ? What we have for Aurora ?

dialogue type : s^ng
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  No . The DC component could be negligible .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  I mean , if you are recording it through a mike .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  I mean , any all of the mikes have the DC removal some capacitor sitting right in that bias it .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  It 's the A - toD that introduces the DC in .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : qr
G :  And the acoustic models are like - k triphone models or or is it the whole word ?

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's triphone .

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  Oh . It 's like the tied state .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
G :  Because w we were wondering whether that VAD is going to be , like , a realistic one or is it going to be some manual segmentation .

dialogue type : s
G :  And then , like , if if that VAD is going to be a realistic one , then we can actually use their markers to shift the point around , I mean , the way we want

dialogue type : s^e.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , rather than keeping the twenty frames , we can actually move the marker to a point which we find more suitable for us .

dialogue type : s
G :  But if that is going to be something like a manual , uh , segmenter , then we can't use that information anymore ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because that 's not going to be the one that is used in the final evaluation .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  So . We don't know what is the type of VAD which they 're going to provide .

dialogue type : s^2
G :  With some some gap .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , with some pauses in the center ,

dialogue type : s
G :  provided they meet that whatever the hang - over time which they are talking .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  Then the they will just fill fill it up .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  Yeah . Well , every everywhere has a delay associated with it .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , you still have to k always keep a buffer ,

dialogue type : s
G :  then only make a decision because you still need to smooth the decision further .

dialogue type : s
G :  So that 's always there .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Can smooth the SNR estimate , also .

dialogue type : s^bu^rt|qy^d^g^rt
G :  Your filter is a function of SNR . Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  Actually , it 's ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  go ahead .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  go ahead .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : %--
G :  u

dialogue type : s^tc
G :  th I 've been playing with this Wiener filter , like .

dialogue type : s
G :  And there are there were some bugs in the program ,

dialogue type : s
G :  so I was p initially trying to clear them up .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Because one of the bug was I was assuming that always the VAD uh , the initial frames were silence .

dialogue type : s
G :  It always started in the silence state ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but it wasn't for some utterances .

dialogue type : s
G :  So the it wasn't estimating the noise initially ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and then it never estimated ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because I assumed that it was always silence .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^m^na
G :  SpeechDat - Car Italian .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  There 're a few cases , actually , which I found later , that there are .

dialogue type : s
G :  So that was one of the bugs that was there in estimating the noise .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  And , uh , so once it was cleared , uh , I ran a few experiments with different ways of smoothing the estimated clean speech and how t estimated the noise and , eh , smoothing the SNR also .

dialogue type : s
G :  And so the the trend seems to be like , uh , smoothing the current estimate of the clean speech for deriving the SNR ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which is like deriving the Wiener filter ,

dialogue type : s
G :  seems to be helping . Then updating it quite fast

dialogue type : s^e
G :  using a very small time constant .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  the More smoothing is helping .

dialogue type : s
G :  But still it 's like it 's still comparable to the baseline .

dialogue type : s
G :  I haven't got anything beyond the baseline .

dialogue type : s
G :  But that 's , like , not using any Wiener filter .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  And , uh , so I 'm I 'm trying a few more experiments with different time constants for smoothing the noise spectrum , and smoothing the clean speech , and smoothing SNR .

dialogue type : s
G :  So there are three time constants that I have .

dialogue type : s
G :  So , I 'm just playing around .

dialogue type : s
G :  So , one is fixed in the line , like Smoothing the clean speech is is helping ,

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  so I 'm not going to change it that much .

dialogue type : s
G :  But , the way I 'm estimating the noise and the way I 'm estimating the SNR , I 'm just trying trying a little bit .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  So , that h

dialogue type : s
G :  And the other thing is , like , putting a floor on the , uh , SNR ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
G :  because that if

dialogue type : s^df
G :  some In some cases the clean speech is , like when it 's estimated , it goes to very low values ,

dialogue type : s
G :  so the SNR is , like , very low .

dialogue type : %--
G :  And

dialogue type : s
G :  so that actually creates a lot of variance in the low - energy region of the speech .

dialogue type : s
G :  So , I 'm thinking of , like , putting a floor also for the SNR so that it doesn't vary a lot in the low - energy regions .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So far I 've been testing only with the baseline , which is which doesn't have any LDA filtering and on - line normalization .

dialogue type : s
G :  I just want to separate the the contributions out .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  So it 's just VAD , plus the Wiener filter , plus the baseline system ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which is , uh , just the spectral I mean , the mel sp mel , uh , frequency coefficients .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um .

dialogue type : s
G :  And the other thing that I tried was but I just took of those , uh , Carlos filters , which Hynek had ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  to see whether it really h helps or not .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  I mean , it was just a a run to see whether it really degrades or it helps .

dialogue type : %--
G :  And

dialogue type : s
G :  it 's it seems to be like it 's not hurting a lot by just blindly picking up one filter

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which is nothing but a four hertz a band - pass m m filter on the cubic root of the power spectrum .

dialogue type : s
G :  So , that was the filter that Hy - uh , Carlos had .

dialogue type : fh
G :  And

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Yeah . Just just to see whether it really it 's it 's is it worth trying or not .

dialogue type : s
G :  So , it doesn't seems to be degrading a lot on that .

dialogue type : s
G :  So there must be something that I can that can be done with that type of noise compensation also ,

dialogue type : s
G :  which I guess I would ask Carlos about that .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  I mean , how how he derived those filters

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^e
G :  and where d if he has any filters which are derived on OGI stories , added with some type of noise which what we are using currently ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  or something like that .

dialogue type : s^cc.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^m^na
G :  Cubic root of power spectrum .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  And I 'm , like , floating it to z zeros right now .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
G :  it actually , uh , enhances the onset and offset of I mean , the the begin and the end of the speech .

dialogue type : s
G :  So it 's there seems to be , like , deep valleys in the begin and the end of , like , high - energy regions ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because the filter has , like , a sort of Mexican - hat type structure .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  when I look at the spectrogram , there are those deep valleys on the begin and the end of the speech .

dialogue type : s
G :  But the rest of it seems to be , like , pretty nice .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s
G :  That 's something I observe using that filter .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fg
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  because the filter doesn't have a really a deep negative portion ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  so that it 's not really creating a lot of negative values in the cubic root .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So ,

dialogue type : s^cc.%--
G :  I 'll I 'll s may continue with that for some w

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  I 'll I 'll Maybe I 'll ask Carlos a little more about how to play with those filters ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and but while making this Wiener filter better .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  That that 's it , Morgan .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
G :  I I I would actually m m didn't get enough time to work on the subspace last week .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  It was mostly about finding those bugs

dialogue type : fh
G :  and

dialogue type : s^e
G :  th you know , things ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and I didn't work much on that .

dialogue type : s^t3
G :  Pratibha .
