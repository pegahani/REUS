dialogue type : s^cs

dialogue type : %-
C :  and then

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C :  Yeah . That 's why I was wondering .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , but when you go around the room you might just get the effect that somebody says something

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  But , um , it 's definitely something I would want to do something on .
