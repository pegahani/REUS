dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
A :  We 're not recording yet , are we ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Um , Meeting Recorder meeting .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt
A :  OK . Do we do th do you go around the room and do names or anything ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  What ?

dialogue type : s^fe
A :  Whoops .

dialogue type : qy.%--
A :  Would it m

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  Oh , this thing .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : %--
A :  This w

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Alright .

dialogue type : qw
A :  How 's that working ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : %-
A :  Um .

dialogue type : qh.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qh
A :  what can you add to it to get , um , some information that would be helpful for the user - interface design ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  Especially for querying .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , getting people to do queries afterwards ,

dialogue type : s
A :  getting people to do summaries afterwards .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aap
A :  Well , if if you actually take notes as a summary as opposed to n take notes in the sense of taking advantage of the time - stamps .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  So action item or uh , reminder to send this to so - and - so , blah - blah - blah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that wouldn't be a summary .

dialogue type : s
A :  That would just be that would b relate to the query side .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs
A :  Yeah . We also could come up with some code for things that people want to do so that for frequent things .

dialogue type : s^cs^e
A :  And the other things , people can write whatever they want .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , it 's to some extent , uh , for his benefit .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So ,

dialogue type : s
A :  if that you know , if if we just keep it simple then maybe it 's still useful .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  I thought you did that on purpose .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  But anyway , shall we do the roll call ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Mari on channel zero .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  So the there will be jargon that we he There 'll be transcription errors .

dialogue type : fg
A :  So ,

dialogue type : %--
A :  uh , u u

dialogue type : s
A :  So , actually there 's kind of three issues .

dialogue type : s
A :  There 's the CrossPad issue .

dialogue type : qh
A :  Should we do it and , if so , what 'll we have them do ?

dialogue type : qh
A :  Um , do we have s people write summaries ?

dialogue type : qh
A :  Everybody or one person ?

dialogue type : qh
A :  And then , do we ask people for how they would query things ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
A :  W

dialogue type : qw
A :  How about this idea ?

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  That normally at most meetings somebody is delegated to be a note - taker .

dialogue type : qh^cs
A :  And So why don't we just use the notes that somebody takes ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I I think it 's an interesting thing .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  I don't think it gets at the the queries per - se ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but it does give us an information fusion sort of thing that , you know , you wanna i say " what were the hot - points of the meeting ? "

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Well , yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I think you could say they 're gonna ask about , uh , when uh , when did so - and - so s talk about blah .

dialogue type : s
A :  And at least that gives you the word that they might run a query on .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  It 'll tell you the hit but not the query .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
A :  w

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I think the summaries actually may help get us there ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  for a couple reasons .

dialogue type : s
A :  One , if you have a summary if you have a bunch of summaries , you can do a word frequency count and see what words come up in different types of meetings .

dialogue type : s
A :  So " action item " is gonna come up whether it 's a VLSI meeting , or speech meeting , or whatever .

dialogue type : s
A :  So words that come up in different types of meetings may be something that you would want to query about .

dialogue type : s:qw
A :  Um , the second thing you could possibly do with it is just run a little pilot experiment with somebody saying " here 's a summary of a meeting , what questions might you want to ask about it to go back ? "

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's one possi one possible scenario , though , is you have the summary ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and you want to ask questions to get more detail .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
A :  I th

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I think you got to have somebody who knows the pro knows the topic or you know , whose job it is delegated to be the note - taker .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Somebody who 's part of the meeting .

dialogue type : %-
A :  Well

dialogue type : s
A :  I think it serves two purpo purposes .

dialogue type : s
A :  One , as sort of a refresh to help bootstrap queries ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but also , I mean , maybe we do want to generate summaries .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then it 's you know , it 's kind of a key .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A :  Well , i i ?

dialogue type : %-
A :  Or , d o

dialogue type : s
A :  What I I think , you know , in most meetings ,

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  this one being different ,

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Um , you can just make it be on a laptop ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  so then yo you 're dealing with ASCII

dialogue type : s^df^e.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df^e
A :  you don't have to go through handwriting recognition .

dialogue type : s
A :  Um , and then they post - edit it into , uh , a summary

dialogue type : s
A :  and they email it out for minutes .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , that happens in most meetings .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  So , I think it depends on whether it 's a business meeting or a technical discussion .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  And I agree ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  technical discussions you don't usually have somebody taking notes .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b.%
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No , no , no , no .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A :  e

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw
A :  What do you mean we 're not saving it anyway ?

dialogue type : s
A :  I 've written all of this down and it 's getting emailed to you .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I think in many for many meetings there will be some sort of note - taking ,

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s^bd^df
A :  Uh , I mean , we uh , we don't need to require it .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , I think it would be great if we try to get a picture with every meeting .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  so so we won't worry about requiring these things ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but the more things that we can get it for , the more useful it will be for various applications .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , before we leave the CrossPads and and call it done .

dialogue type : s.x
A :  So , if I 'm collecting data then there is this question of do I use CrossPads ?

dialogue type : s
A :  So , I think that if we really seriously have me collect data and I can't use CrossPads , it 's probably less useful for you guys to go to the trouble of using it ,

dialogue type : fh|s^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : %--
A :  n

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I 'm not I 'm not sure what they 're gonna do .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  But but having a small percentage of the data with it ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'm not sure whether that 's useful or not .

dialogue type : s^bd^df^rt
A :  Maybe maybe it 's no big deal .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Maybe we just do it and see what happens .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Nothing .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  That 's true .

dialogue type : s
A :  So if it if it seems to be really useful to you guys , we could probably get a donation to me .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s^t^tc
A :  OK . So CrossPads , we 're just gonna try it and see what happens .

dialogue type : s^bk.%
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^t^tc.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  So , I I think that this is gonna be useful .

dialogue type : s
A :  So if we record data I will definitely ask for it .

dialogue type : s^cs:qy
A :  So , I j I think we should just say this is not we don't want to put any extra burden on people , but if they happen to generate minutes , could could they send it to us ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b.%
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  But but again , like the CrossPads , I don't think I would base a lot of stuff on it ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because I think I know when I see the the clock coming near the end of the meeting , I 'm like inching towards the door .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So ,

dialogue type : s
A :  you 're probably not gonna get a lot of people wanting to do this .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
A :  Yeah . I think that I think doing it orally at the end of the meeting is the best time .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because they 're kind of a captive audience .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Once they leave ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  you know , forget it .

dialogue type : %-
A :  But but i

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  But , uh , I don't think that they 'll necessarily you 'll you 'll get many people willing to stay .

dialogue type : s^bd.%--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  For a little while I thought it was just that I was really tired .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
A :  That and y Too much caffeine and really tired ,

dialogue type : s:s
A :  but then I thought " no , maybe that 's real " .

dialogue type : qw^d^rt
A :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : h|qw
A :  Um , what 's our schedule ?

dialogue type : s^t1
A :  Let 's see ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  you and I need dis Uh ,

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
A :  no , we did the Liz talk .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So so that was the prosody thing .

dialogue type : fh|s^co.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's already four - fifteen .

dialogue type : s^bsc
A :  Uh , after .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  We need to finish this discussion , and you

dialogue type : s^cs^e
A :  and I need a little time for wrap - up and quad chart .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : h|qw
A :  Um , what what 's the plan for this discussion ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , less .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^2.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So ,

dialogue type : qh^cs
A :  e e why don't you say five - thirty ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is that OK ?

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  We 'll probably hit horrible traffic .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's not a lot of time ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : b.%
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  But actually I would say that 's a better thing to ask than have them summarize the meeting .

dialogue type : s^m.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
A :  Yeah , that 's true .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba^na
A :  Yeah , that 's actually a really good idea .

dialogue type : s:qw
A :  But actually it would be an easy thing to just go around the room and say what was the most interesting thing you learned ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  for those pe people willing to stay .

dialogue type : s
A :  And and that might be something people are willing to stay for .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  That 's fine .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Well , I That 's hard to generate

dialogue type : s
A :  and and I think that 's half of what i I would use it for .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  But I also a lot of times um , make you know , think to myself " this is interesting ,

dialogue type : s^e:s
A :  I 've gotta come back and follow up on it " .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , things that I think are interesting , um , I would be , uh , wanting to do a query about .

dialogue type : s
A :  And also , I like the idea of going around the room ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because if somebody else thought something was interesting , I 'd kind of want to know about it

dialogue type : s^df^e
A :  and then I 'd want to follow up on it .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK - OK .

dialogue type : s^t^tc.%-
A :  In the interest of , um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  No , i in the interest of generating some minutes here ,

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , and also moving on to action items and other things ,

dialogue type : s^t
A :  let me just go through the things that I wrote down as being important ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  um , that we at least decided on .

dialogue type : s
A :  CrossPads we were going to try ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  um , if Landay can get the , uh get them to to you guys ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um , and see if they 're interesting .

dialogue type : s
A :  And if they are , then we 'll try to get m do it more .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  getting electronic summary from a note - taking person if they happen to do it anyway .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  a couple digital pictures of the the table and boards to set the context of the meeting .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Uh , and then going around the room at the end to just say qu ask people to mention something interesting that they learned .

dialogue type : s
A :  So rather than say the most interesting thing , something interesting ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  and that way you 'll get more variety .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  " Thing that was discussed . "

dialogue type : s
A :  And then the last thing c would be for those people who are willing to stay afterwards and give an oral summary .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  OK ?

dialogue type : qy
A :  Does that pretty much cover everything we talked about ?

dialogue type : s^e
A :  That well , that we want to do ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Play with and generate real queries from .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , we 're piloting .

dialogue type : s
A :  We 'll just do it and see what happens .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt^t^tc
A :  OK - OK . Speaking of action items , can we move on to action items ?

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  or maybe we should wait until the summary of this until this meeting is transcribed

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  and then we will hav

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|qh^cs
A :  Yeah . In fact , why don't you hand me those transparencies so that I remember to take them .

dialogue type : %--
A :  eee ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^t
A :  What I have down for action items is we 're supposed to find out about our human subject , um , requirements .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^rt^t
A :  people are supposed to send me U R

dialogue type : s^e^rt
A :  for their for web pages ,

dialogue type : s
A :  to c and I 'll put together an overall cover .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  And you 're s

dialogue type : qw^br
A :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^na
A :  And and you also need to look at your web page

dialogue type : s^e^na
A :  and clean it up by mid - July .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^t1
A :  let 's see .

dialogue type : s^t1
A :  Choo - choo - choo .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  Mailing list ?

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  Uh , you need to put together a mailing list .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  Uh , I think w

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
A :  uh , I need to email Adam or Jane ,

dialogue type : fg|s^e^rt
A :  um , about getting the data .

dialogue type : qw
A :  Who should I email ?

dialogue type : h
A :  Um .

dialogue type : qh^cs.%--
A :  How about if I just c

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I personally only want text data .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bd^df
A :  But I 'm just speaking fr based on a conversation with him two weeks ago I had in Turkey .

dialogue type : s
A :  But I think all he would want is the digits .

dialogue type : s
A :  Um , but I 'll just speak for myself .

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'm interested in getting the language model data .

dialogue type : s
A :  Eh , so I 'm just interested in getting transcriptions .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
A :  So then just email you ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qw^d
A :  And your email is ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s^t^tc
A :  OK . Related to to the conversation with Picheny ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I need to email him , uh , my shipping address

dialogue type : s
A :  and you need to email them something which you already did .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah . We never had our data format discussion .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  W My my u feeling right now on format is you guys have been doing all the work

dialogue type : s
A :  and whatever you want , we 're happy to live with .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  other people may not agree with that ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but Cuz I 'm not actually touching the data ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so I shouldn't be the one to talk .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa^j
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Or , like if you have somebody who makes your your plane reservations for you ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  um , which is

dialogue type : %-
A :  the n

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
A :  Yeah . Yeah . Seriously .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  e You know , it could result in some good bloopers ,

dialogue type : s
A :  which is always good for presentations .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^t1
A :  Let 's see ,

dialogue type : s^t^tc
A :  other action items .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'm I 'm shooting to try to get it done get it put together by the beginning of August .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  you know , if

dialogue type : s^no
A :  We don't know .

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  i It 's probably unlikely that we 'll pull this off ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but a at least it 's worth trying .

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|s^t^tc
A : 

dialogue type : s^no
A :  Um , I 'm not sure what to do about action items for the data stuff ,

dialogue type : s
A :  although , then somebody I guess somebody needs to tell Landay that you want the pads .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh !

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  But but that 's actually what I wanna do .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's that 's what I wanna work with ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  is is things that s the wrong material but the right da the right source .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  Yeah . He seemed when I asked him if he could actually supply data , he seemed a little bit more reluctant .

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  So , I 'll I 'll send him email .

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'll put it in an action item that I send him email about it .

dialogue type : s
A :  And if I get something , great .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Landay .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And , uh , um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  you know , otherwise , if you guys have any papers

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I could I could use , uh I could use your web pages .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's what we could do .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  You 've got all the web pages on the Meeting Recor

dialogue type : s^aa^fe
A :  Yeah !

dialogue type : s^bk|s^co
A :  Oh , forget this !

dialogue type : s^t^tc
A :  I One less action item .

A :  I can use what web pages there are out there on meeting recorders .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , there 's there 's ICSI , Xerox ,

dialogue type : s
A :  CMU ,

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba|s
A :  Great . That solves that problem .

dialogue type : s^t
A :  One less action item .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fg|s^t
A :  OK . I think that 's good enou that 's that 's pretty much all I can think of .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I don't think we should have rules of participation ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  but I think we should try to get a variety of meetings .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's something that if we get the the meeting stuff going at UW , that I probably can do more than you guys ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  cuz you guys are probably mostly going to get ICSI people here .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  and and possibly also some CS people , uh , over at UW .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , I think that that there 's a good chance we could get more variety .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I 'm just writing here , we 're not gonna try to specify rules of interaction

dialogue type : s
A :  but we 're gonna try to get more variety by i using different groups of people

dialogue type : s^e^rt
A :  and different sizes .

dialogue type : %-
A :  e e

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then the other thing might be , um , uh , technical versus administrative .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Cuz if I recorded some administrative meetings then that may have less overlap ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because you might have more overlap when you 're doing something technical and disagreeing or whatever .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  Well , the reason why I didn't want to is be why I personally didn't want to is because I wanted it to be as , uh , unintrusive as possi

dialogue type : s^e
A :  as you could be with these things hanging on you .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is that an action item ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
A :  Yes , we should do that .

dialogue type : s
A :  They 're related to this morning 's meeting .

dialogue type : s
A :  I think I think " pass " is socially acceptable .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , a spin on different slightly different spin on what you said ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  this issue of , uh , realizing that we could take minutes ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and that actually may be a goal .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that that may be kind of the test in a sense , test data ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  uh , the the template of what we want to test against , generating a summary .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that 's an interesting new twist on what we can do with this data .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Great .
