dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^cc

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And , I need t true eh , silence

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  for that , because my my idea is to to study the nnn the the set of parameters eh , what , eh , are more m more discriminant to eh , classify .

dialogue type : s
C :  the overlapping zones in cooperation with the speech eh zones .

dialogue type : s
C :  The idea is to eh to use eh , I 'm not sure to eh yet , but eh my idea is to use a a cluster eh algorithm or , nnn , a person strong in neural net algorithm to eh to eh study

dialogue type : s
C :  what is the , eh , the property of the different feat eh feature , eh , to classify eh speech and overlapping eh speech .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^na

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s
C :  only eh , eh , nnn , mmm , I have eh , ehm I don't remind what is the the the the quantity ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but eh , I I have marked enough speech on over and all the overlapping zones .

dialogue type : s
C :  I have , eh , two hundred and thirty , more or less , overlapping zones , and is similar to to this information ,

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : s
C :  I I I put , eh , eh , for each frame a label indicating what is th the type , what is the class , eh , which it belong .

dialogue type : s
C :  And in a first eh , nnn , step in the investi in the research in eh , my idea is try to , eh , to prove , what is the performance of the difference parameter , eh to classify the different , eh , what is the the the the front - end approach to classify eh , the different , eh , frames of each class eh and what is the the , nnn , nnn , nnn , eh , what is the , the error eh , of the data

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : %
C :  Eh ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Eh , similar , because the the idea is to to study what is the contribution of eh , each parameter to the process of classify correctly the different the different parameters .

dialogue type : s
C :  Eh , the the the classifier is nnn by the moment is eh is eh , similar , nnn , that the classifier used eh , in a quantifier vectorial quantifier is eh , used to to eh , some distance to to put eh , a vector eh , in in a class different .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : qw

dialogue type : qw
C :  What 's the problem I I I I see in in in if you you use the the neural network ?

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s
C :  I eh the the Meeting Recorder project , for me , has eh , two eh , w has eh several parts , several p objective

dialogue type : s
C :  eh , because it 's a a great project .

dialogue type : s
C :  But eh , at the first , in the acoustic , eh , eh , parts of the project , eh I think you eh we have eh two main eh objective .

dialogue type : s
C :  One one of these is to eh to detect the change , the acoustic change .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And for that , if you don't use , eh , eh , a speech recognizer , eh broad class , or not broad class to to try to to to label the different frames , I think the Ike criterion or BIC criterion eh will be enough to detect the change .

dialogue type : s
C :  And Probably . I I I I would like to to t prove .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , probably . When you you have , eh , eh s eh the transition of speech or or silence eh to overlap zone , this criterion is enough with probably with , eh , this kind of , eh , eh the the the more eh use eh use eh used eh em normal , regular eh parameter MF - MFCC .

dialogue type : s
C :  you you have to to to find you can find the the mark .

dialogue type : s
C :  You can find the nnn , the the acoustic change .

dialogue type : s
C :  But eh eh I I understand that you your objective is to eh classify , to know that eh that zone not is only a new zone in the in the file , that eh you have eh , but you have to to to know that this is overlap zone .

dialogue type : s
C :  because in the future you will eh try to to process that zone with a non - regular eh eh speech recognizer model , I suppose .

dialogue type : s
C :  you you will pretend to to to process the overlapping z eh zone with another kind of algorithm

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because it 's very difficult to to to obtain the transcription from eh using eh eh a regular , normal speech recognizer .

dialogue type : s
C :  That , you know , I I I think is the idea .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so eh the , nnn the the system eh will have two models .

dialogue type : s
C :  A model to detect more acc the mor most accurately possible that is p uh , will be possible the , eh the mark , the change

dialogue type : s
C :  and another another model will @ @ or several models , to try s but eh several model eh robust models , sample models to try to classify the difference class .

dialogue type : s
C :  Eh , the the classifiers of the of the n to detect the different class to the different zones before try to to recognize , eh with eh to transcribe , with eh a speech recognizer .

dialogue type : s
C :  And my idea is to use eh , for example , a neural net

dialogue type : s
C :  with the information we obtain from this eh this eh study of the parameter with the selected parameter to try to eh to put the class of each frame . Eh for the difference zone

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : qw
