dialogue type : qy^d^rt
E :  Th - that 's his spectral subtraction group ?

dialogue type : qy
E :  Is that right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : qy^cs^d^rt
E :  So I guess I should probably talk to him a bit too ?

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  So , um , since we 're looking at putting this , um mean log m magnitude spectral subtraction , um , into the SmartKom system , I I did a test seeing if , um , it would work using past only and plus the present to calculate the mean .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , I did a test , um , where I used twelve seconds from the past and the present frame to , um , calculate the mean .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : h
E : 

dialogue type : s^na
E :  Twelve seconds , um , counting back from the end of the current frame ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  So it was , um , twen I think it was twenty - one frames

dialogue type : s
E :  and that worked out to about twelve seconds .

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  And compared to , um , do using a twelve second centered window , I think there was a drop in performance

dialogue type : s
E :  but it was just a slight drop .

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  Is is that right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
E :  So that was encouraging .

dialogue type : fh
E :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  that that um , that 's encouraging for for the idea of using it in an interactive system like

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  And , um , another issue I 'm I 'm thinking about is in the SmartKom system .

dialogue type : s
E :  So say twe twelve seconds in the earlier test seemed like a good length of time ,

dialogue type : qw
E :  but what happens if you have less than twelve seconds ?

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  So I w bef before , um Back in May , I did some experiments using , say , two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds .

dialogue type : s
E :  In those I trained the models using mean subtraction with the means calculated over two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds .

dialogue type : fh
E :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  here , I was curious , what if I trained the models using twelve seconds

dialogue type : s
E :  but I f I gave it a situation where the test set I was subtracted using two seconds , or four seconds , or six seconds .

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  So I did that for about three different conditions .

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  I mean , I th I think it was , um , four se

dialogue type : s^r
E :  I think I think it was , um , something like four seconds and , um , six seconds , and eight seconds .

dialogue type : s
E :  Something like that .

dialogue type : s
E :  And it seems like it it it hurts compared to if you actually train the models using th that same length of time

dialogue type : s^df
E :  but it it doesn't hurt that much .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  u usually less than point five percent ,

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  although I think I did see one where it was a point eight percent or so rise in word error rate .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  But this is , um , w where , um , even if I train on the , uh , model , and mean subtracted it with the same length of time as in the test , it the word error rate is around , um , ten percent or nine percent .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  So it doesn't seem like that big a d a difference

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  That that 's true .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um ,

dialogue type : %
E :  Wa

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  Um , t twelve s

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  N n uh For the test it 's just twelve seconds in the past .

dialogue type : s
E :  Of of speech .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  And that 's actually what we 're planning to do in

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  s so I g So I guess the que the question I was trying to get at with those experiments is , " does it matter what models you use ?

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Does it matter how much time y you use to calculate the mean when you were , um , tra doing the training data ? "

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : h
E :  Um ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
E :  you do you mean in my tests so far ?

dialogue type : s
E :  Most of the silence has been cut out .

dialogue type : s
E :  Just There 's just inter - word silences .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  Pretty short .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s^ng
E :  Well , if I only use six seconds , it still works pretty well .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  I saw in my test before .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  I was trying twelve seconds cuz that was the best in my test before

dialogue type : s^df
E :  and that increasing past twelve seconds didn't seem to help .

dialogue type : fh
E :  th um , yeah ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I guess it 's something I need to play with more to decide how to set that up for the SmartKom system .

dialogue type : s^cs^e.%--
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : %
E :  M

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
E :  S so , um ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  the the idea of the second pass would be waiting till you have more recorded speech ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
E :  Or ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  I guess that 's it .
