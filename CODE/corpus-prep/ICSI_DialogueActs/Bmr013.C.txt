dialogue type : %-
C :  So , uh

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Oh good .

dialogue type : b.x
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt^t
C :  OK , agenda items ,

dialogue type : fh|s^rt.x
C :  Uh , we have digits ,

dialogue type : qw^t
C :  What else we got ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m^rt
C :  New version of presegmentation .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
C :  Update on transcripts .

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
C :  Filtering for what ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Got it .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt^t.x
C :  Anything else more pressing than those things ?

dialogue type : fh|qh^cs^t
C :  So So , why don't we just do those .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  So , I 'm impressed by what we could do , Is take the standard training set for TI - digits , train up with whatever , you know , great features we think we have , uh for instance , and then test on uh this test set .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  And presumably uh it should do reasonably well on that ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  and then , presumably , we should go to the distant mike , and it should do poorly .

dialogue type : sj^j
C :  And then we should get really smart over the next year or two , and it that should get better .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah , Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : qy.%-
C : 

dialogue type : fg|qw
C :  Uh , what what do you think ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
C :  So you think it 's fine to have the transcribers do it ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah just by way of uh , uh , a uh , order of magnitude , uh , um , we 've been working with this Aurora , uh data set .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , uh , the best score , on the , nicest part of the data , that is , where you 've got training and test set that are basically the same kinds of noise and so forth , uh , is about ,

dialogue type : h
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I think the best score was something like five percent , uh , error , per digit .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  You 're right .

dialogue type : s
C :  So if you were doing ten digit , uh , recognition , you would really be in trouble .

dialogue type : s
C :  So So the The point there , and this is uh car noise uh , uh things , but but real real situation ,

dialogue type : s^t1.%--
C :  well , " real " ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um , the uh there 's one microphone that 's close , that they have as as this sort of thing , close versus distant .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh but in a car ,

dialogue type : s
C :  instead of instead of having a projector noise it 's it 's car noise .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh but it wasn't artificially added to get some some artificial signal - to - noise ratio .

dialogue type : s
C :  It was just people driving around in a car .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So , that 's that 's an indication ,

dialogue type : s
C :  uh that was with , many sites competing , and this was the very best score and so forth ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  so . More typical numbers like

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  You 're right .

dialogue type : sj
C :  I think that we could have done better on the models ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  but the thing is that we got this this is the kind of typical number , for all of the , uh , uh , things in this task , all of the , um , languages .

dialogue type : sj
C :  And so I I think we 'd probably the models would be better in some than in others .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um , so , uh . Anyway , just an indication once you get into this kind of realm even if you 're looking at connected digits it can be pretty hard .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s^no.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  no , no I mean it 's connected it 's connected , uh , digits ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : %-
C :  But .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
C :  Yeah , I mean we were in the .

dialogue type : h|s^ar
C :  Uh , I th no I think we got under a percent ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  but it was but it 's but I mean . The very best system that I saw in the literature was a point two five percent or something that somebody had at at Bell Labs , or . Uh , but . But , uh , sort of pulling out all the stops .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  But I think a lot of systems sort of get half a percent , or three - quarters a percent ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and we 're we 're in there somewhere .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j^na
C :  When When they 're wide awake , yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^j^m|s^bk
C :  after coffee , you 're right .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  Not after lunch .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  One question I have that that I mean , we wouldn't know the answer to now but might , do some guessing , but I was talking before about doing some model modeling of arti uh , uh , marking of articulatory , features , with overlap and so on .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And , and , um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  On some subset .

dialogue type : s
C :  One thought might be to do this uh , on on the digits , or some piece of the digits .

dialogue type : sj
C :  Uh , it 'd be easier , uh , and so forth .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  The only thing is I 'm a little concerned that maybe the kind of phenomena , in w i i

dialogue type : s
C :  The reason for doing it is because the the argument is that certainly with conversational speech , the stuff that we 've looked at here before , um , just doing the simple mapping , from , um , the phone , to the corresponding features that you could look up in a book , uh , isn't right .

dialogue type : s^r
C :  It isn't actually right .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  In fact there 's these overlapping processes where some voicing some up and then some , you know , some nasality is comes in here , and so forth .

dialogue type : s
C :  And you do this gross thing saying " Well I guess it 's this phone starting there " .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  So , uh , that 's the reasoning .

dialogue type : sj
C :  But , It could be that when we 're reading digits , because it 's it 's for such a limited set , that maybe maybe that phenomenon doesn't occur as much .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't know .

dialogue type : qo^rt
C :  Di - an anybody ? Do you have any ? Anybody have any opinion about that ,

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  See , I don't know .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  So , may maybe the thing will be do to take some very small subset , I mean not have a big , program , but take a small set , uh , subset of the conversational speech and a small subset of the digits ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  and look and and just get a feeling for it .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
C :  Um , just take a look . Really .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
C :  Cuz I don't think anybody is , I at least , I don't know , of anybody , uh ,

dialogue type : s^no
C :  well , I don't know , the answers .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , but I I I I was , like he said , I was gonna bring John in and ask John what he thought .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^arp
C :  But I mean you want you want it be restrictive but you also want it to to to have coverage .

dialogue type : s
C :  You know i you should . It should be such that if you , if you , uh , if you had o um , all of the features , determined that you that you were uh ch have chosen , that that would tell you , uh , in the steady - state case , uh , the phone .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , um .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^m
C :  Place , place .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
C :  OK we got our jargon then , OK .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aap
C :  Well you might be right that mi might be the way at getting at , what I was talking about ,

dialogue type : s^arp
C :  but the particular reason why I was interested in doing that was because I remember , when that happened , and , John Ohala was over here and he was looking at the spectrograms of the more difficult ones .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh , he didn't know what to say , about , what is the sequence of phones there .

dialogue type : s
C :  They came up with some compromise .

dialogue type : s
C :  Because that really wasn't what it look like .

dialogue type : s
C :  It didn't look like a sequence of phones

dialogue type : s
C :  it look like this blending thing happening here and here and here .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu.%-
C :  Do you mean ,

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , I mean , I I I 'm jus at the moment of course we 're just talking about what , to provide as a tool for people to do research who have different ideas about how to do it .

dialogue type : s
C :  So for instance , you might have someone who just has a wor has words with states , and has uh uh , comes from articulatory gestures to that .

dialogue type : s
C :  And someone else , might actually want some phonetic uh intermediate thing .

dialogue type : sj^cs
C :  So I think it would be be best to have all of it if we could .

dialogue type : fh
C :  But um ,

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I remember when at one of the Switchboard , workshops , that uh when we talked about doing the transcription project , Dave Talkin said , " can't be done " .

dialogue type : s
C :  He was he was , what what he meant was that this isn't , you know , a sequence of phones ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  and when you actually look at Switchboard that 's , not what you see , and , you know . And . It ,

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
C :  yeah I mean it was

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , no I I don't disagree with that .

dialogue type : fg|s^aap
C :  Yeah u I don't disagree with it

dialogue type : s^arp.%--
C :  the on the only thing is that , What you actually will end en end up with is something ,

dialogue type : s
C :  i it 's all compromised ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  right ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so , the string that you end up with isn't , actually , what happened .

dialogue type : s
C :  But it 's it 's the best compromise that a group of people scratching their heads could come up with to describe what happened .

dialogue type : s^m
C :  But . And it 's more accurate than the than the dictionary or , if you 've got a pronunciation uh lexicon that has three or four ,

dialogue type : s
C :  this might be have been the fifth one that you tr that you pruned or whatever ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so sure .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , so I mean , what , what where this is , I mean , I I want would like to have something that 's useful to people other than those who are doing the specific kind of research I have in mind ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  so it should be something broader .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , The but uh where I 'm coming from is , uh , we 're coming off of stuff that Larry Saul did with with , um , uh , John Dalan and Muzim Rahim in which , uh , they , uh , have , um , a m a multi - band system that is , uh , trained through a combination of gradient learning an and EM , to um , estimate , uh , the , uh , value for m for for a particular feature .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  And this is part of a larger , image that John Dalan has about how the human brain does it in which he 's sort of imagining that , individual frequency channels are coming up with their own estimate , of of these , these kinds of something like this .

dialogue type : s
C :  Might not be , you know , exact features that , Jakobson thought of or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  But I mean you know some , something like that .

dialogue type : s
C :  Some kind of low - level features , which are not , fully , you know , phone classification .

dialogue type : s
C :  And the the th this particular image , of how thi how it 's done , is that , then given all of these estimates at that level , there 's a level above it , then which is is making , some kind of sound unit classification such as , you know , phone

dialogue type : s
C :  and and , you know . You could argue what , what a sound unit should be , and and so forth .

dialogue type : s
C :  But that that 's sort of what I was imagining doing ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  um , and but it 's still open within that whether you would have an intermediate level in which it was actually phones , or not .

dialogue type : s
C :  You wouldn't necessarily have to .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um , but , Again , I wouldn't wanna , wouldn't want what we we produced to be so , know , local in perspective that it it was matched , what we were thinking of doing one week ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And and , and , you know , what you 're saying is absolutely right .

dialogue type : s^bs^cs
C :  That , that if we , can we should put in , uh , another level of , of description there if we 're gonna get into some of this low - level stuff .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's so it 's a little different .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  So I mean i we 'll see wha how much we can , uh , get the people to do , and how much money we 'll have and all this sort of thing ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  but ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Might be do both .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well I think what I mean I 'm I 'm a l little behind in what they 're doing , now , and , uh , the stuff they 're doing on Switchboard now .

dialogue type : s
C :  But I think that , Steve and the gang are doing , something with an automatic system first and then doing some adjustment .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  As I re as I recall .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
C :  So I mean that 's probably the right way to go anyway , is to is to start off with an automatic system with a pretty rich pronunciation dictionary that , that , um , you know , tries , to label it all .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And then , people go through and fix it .

dialogue type : fg|s^nd
C :  Well , regular dictionary , I mean , this is a pretty rich dictionary .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  It 's got , got a fair number of pronunciations in it

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  Actually maybe they 're using phone recognizers .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Is that what they 're doing ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  Yeah , so I think that i i we also don't have , I mean ,

dialogue type : s
C :  we 've got a good start on it ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but we don't have a really good , meeting , recorder or recognizer or transcriber or anything yet ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  So , I mean another way to look at this is to , is to , uh , do some stuff on Switchboard which has all this other , stuff to it .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
C :  And then , um , As we get , further down the road and we can do more things ahead of time , we can , do some of the same things to the meeting data .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Yeah

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  Anyway , this is , not an urgent thing at all ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  just it came up .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co^t
C :  We should move on .

dialogue type : h|qo^d^rt^t
C :  Uh , new version of , uh , presegmentation ?

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , we don't have that much variety in meetings yet ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C :  uh , I mean we have this meeting and the feature meeting and we have a couple others that we have uh , couple examples of . But but , uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  Poten - potentially .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : qw.%--
C :  Of of of the meetings that you 're working with , how many of them are different , tha

dialogue type : qy
C :  are there any of them that are different than , these two meetings ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , speakers .

dialogue type : s^fa
C :  Sorry .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  so you have the networks meeting ?

dialogue type : qy^r.%--
C :  Do you have any of Jerry 's meetings in your , pack , er ,

dialogue type : s^bk^m
C :  No ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^df
C :  Cuz I think he really needs variety ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and and having as much variety for speaker certainly would be a big part of that I think .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
C :  Ye - But you 're y

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So that should be faster than the ten times kind of thing ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
C :  Well , that 's probably .

dialogue type : s
C :  They 're running out of data unless we s make the decision that we should go over and start , uh , transcribing the other set .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  There the first the first half .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Alright .

dialogue type : s
C :  So this , blends nicely into the update on transcripts .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba^rt^tc
C :  Good

dialogue type : s^t^tc
C :  s I think that 's probably our agenda , or starting up there .

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  Yeah ? K .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  K .

dialogue type : s
C :  They go where old microphones go .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  For the recor for the record Adam is not a paid employee or a consultant of Crown .

dialogue type : s^r
C :  I said " For the record Adam is is not a paid consultant or employee of Crown " .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  You bet . You bet .

dialogue type : s
C :  So if we go to a workshop about all this this it 's gonna be a meeting about meetings about meetings .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
C :  Oh , yeah , what Which 'll be the meeting about the meeting about the meeting .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^cs:s
C :  Just start saying " M four " .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt^t^tc
C :  Should we do the digits ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : z
C :  OK .
