dialogue type : qy^rt

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  And and then when you d display different things , it 's fine ?

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s|s^aa
C :  Well , a new meeting , a transcript . Right .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%-

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^m^rt
C :  Go wrong ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
C :  Oh ! Oh , you 're downloading a whole meeting .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Oh , yeah that @ @ .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then still do it ahead of time ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but then at least you 're covered if if , uh if there 's a problem .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  OK . Well , I 'm gonna start working on this the week after next ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so that 's the point when I 'll need to look more carefully at what y what what you guys have .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
C :  Right . The week after th th

dialogue type : s
C :  The Monday the week after next is July second ,

dialogue type : s
C :  which is the first day I get back .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Well , uh , I 'm giving a talk on July sixteenth .

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
C :  It 's a Mon - Monday in four weeks ?

dialogue type : qrr^d^rt
C :  Three weeks ?

dialogue type : s^ba^j
C :  It 's always exciting to hear that Java 's faster than something .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  Beep .

dialogue type : s
C :  We 're all entitled to our opinions here .

dialogue type : fg|s^t^tc
C :  Um . Yeah . So it 's Yeah . I think it must be three and a half weeks .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Uh , cuz July The the meeting is July sixteenth through eighteenth .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , uh , my talk 's the first day .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm flying out there the Sunday before .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I guess , you know , it 'd be desirable if , a week ahead of that , we basically had thought we had it ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  which would allow a week for

dialogue type : s
C :  re - iterating .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah . Pretty much .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I th I saw that .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it 's it 's case insensitive ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , we have our first information retrieval example .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's a regular expression

dialogue type : s
C :  searcher .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:s^co
C :  You wanna say , " Where are al where Find all the contentious things I said . "

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Um Right .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Has has has Joachim Sokol replied ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  Or ?

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  He 's not around , is the only problem .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba
C :  Yeah . Otherwise , it 'd be a good idea .

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah . He popped in .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  But , I mean , he 's basically gone .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Yeah . And and tell her You know . Tell her your specific problem .

dialogue type : s.%--

dialogue type : s|s^aa

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I i in in other meetings .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , SRI people , easy to f find .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , uh , IBM people , also . Just let us know .

dialogue type : %--

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Uh . I know they 're in .

dialogue type : qy.%-
C :  And , uh But I don't know . I think he was Wasn't he asking about ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , there was an issue .

dialogue type : s
C :  He wanted to take it down .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C :  Wel

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  Markham probably needs u H he probably needs us to approve another time to take things down .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^e^rt
C :  In order to do that ?

dialogue type : s
C :  I thought he I thought he said in that mail that he would need to take it down another time .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  We store we store our data on Popcorn .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  That 's really great .

dialogue type : s
C :  I was just thinking we store our data on Popcorn .

dialogue type : qw
C :  How many how many institutes can you say do that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , g megabytes and mega many megabytes , too .

dialogue type : qw.%-
C :  Um , what what , uh ?

dialogue type : qw
C :  So uh , what what 's on your queue for for recognition experiments ?

dialogue type : s^cs^t^tc
C :  Let 's talk about that for a second , maybe .

dialogue type : qw^r
C :  What what was on his queue for recognition experiments ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^t3
C : 

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs.%--
C :  Um , I think it would be ne neat at some point in this to do , um , a recognition , uh , pass on one of the PZM mikes for these s same meetings that you 've been gi n gi bi

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  I mean , it 's gonna be terrible ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but , you know , we we just don't know how terrible .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah . Cuz you have a set of scores about that ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so maybe then , that wouldn't be so bad .

dialogue type : b
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  But that 'd be a hell of a lot better than what we do with just these .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  and and , again , if you rule out the overlap , you have some numbers for that ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Cuz you have scores for that for the other case .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  We just don't know how bad it will be .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , one of the things that Dave was noticing we were talking this morning is that i it seems like and we do don't know this in detail , but it seems like you 're getting a lot from the channel adaptation , the speaker adaptation , and so forth .

dialogue type : s
C :  Um . So you are , already , in that recognizer , doing something that is likely to affect , uh , the the far - field microphone , uh , formant .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , it 's gonna be bad ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but , uh , it may not be , like , " won't decode " kind of bad .

dialogue type : s
C :  It might might only be that it goes from forty percent to eighty , or something like that .

dialogue type : s
C :  I want us to assume the exac whatever it was you assumed when you did the other the the close mike .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  But you 're saying for this For the adaptation , you mean .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I I have a suggestion .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Do the simplest thing first .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Because we 're gonna want to know that anyway .

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  In other words , if you d

dialogue type : s^ar|s
C :  No . It 's No . It 's even simpler thing than that , is just that you don't know .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df
C :  Yeah . Because you can get a number uh , for that with the other as well .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  You can turn those things off .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah . And then put it in correctly and see how much that helps .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  I mean , I was just thinking , do the one that 's easiest first ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because you wanna know how much that 's helping you in these cases anyhow .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah . If you don't have one more than one mike , you don't have a very good handle on location .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  That 's it 's not enough .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , say , if if you had a a cardioid mike or something sitting someplace , then sitting there , then it would Its its response to him would be about the same as the response to him , and so on .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^ba^cs
C :  But Anyway , I I 'd it 'd be neat to have that ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because you know we 've been at this for a little while

dialogue type : s
C :  and we don't have have any results yet with with conversational speech at a distance .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  We should at least get a first one .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
C :  Um , and the other thing This would kind of be a Hail Mary ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but but , uh Uh , Dave does have this stuff that is helping on digits ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and , you know , and so with then it 'd be , you know , just throw that in and see .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap
C :  Uh , well , he can do it in something else .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Actually , we 're experimenting with phase stuff now ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and and , uh , thi this , uh first result he got , uh , was really great .

dialogue type : s
C :  It actually , uh uh didn't exactly eliminate the reverberation ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but it completely got rid of the speech .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C :  Yeah . Well , I was thinking that .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  You think I didn't s tell him that ?

dialogue type : s
C :  No . I got pretty excited ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because it completely got rid of the speech .

dialogue type : s.%--:s.%--
C :  So , I was thinking " well , so ,

dialogue type : s
C :  you know , it could be useful for lots of things " .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qw^br
C :  What ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , we have to sort of check that out .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Reminds me of when th when Herve and I were first playing with c uh , context - dependent things for nets ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and and at one point we took out the speech input ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so we only had priors , and our performance went up .

dialogue type : b
C :  S Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , of course it was a bug .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , I mean , it 's it 's a but it was pretty f f It was pretty funny anyway .

dialogue type : s
C :  So that 's how it was generated .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
C :  Uh , but cheating is is p

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  Sure . But chea but cheating is is is pretty commonly used to mean this .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|%-
C :  Yeah . I i i i

dialogue type : %-
C :  I it 's i

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's even more than that .

dialogue type : s
C :  I think it it really gives a very strong perspective , that you know that what you were doing is not an un - biased experiment .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  If you don't say that , then people think " oh , they did that and they threw that , but that doesn't represent what would happen in the real world " .

dialogue type : s
C :  But if you say " we did a n cheating experiment " , which is really the standard way you 'd say it , it says you deliberately put in a piece of me information that you would not have in the real world so that you can learn something .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Just as part as your process .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  So it 's I d I don't know ,

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C :  i

dialogue type : s^am|s
C :  Maybe . I I 've heard this at ICSLP for years and years and years , though .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , it 's it 's pretty pretty common . People say this .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah . It 's machine machine experiments .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C :  Um , I mean , w when when the , uh , the neural net w uh wave hit in the mid - eighties ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and by the late eighties there were uh , we were reviewing thousands of papers that were coming out in neural nets .

dialogue type : s
C :  It was really hot .

dialogue type : s
C :  Everybody thought it would do everything .

dialogue type : s
C :  Um , and a really common error that people were making was , they were just reporting their , uh uh , classification results on the data that they were training on .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  And so I think it was it was it was very important for people then who were doing something diagnostic to say " hey , I know I 'm doing something that isn't kosher " .

dialogue type : s^df^e
C :  And to make it really clear that they knew it .

dialogue type : s
C :  So that was , I think , why why it became a popular term .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  But it isn't bootstrapping .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , it 's it 's really cheating .

dialogue type : %-
C :  It 's just ng

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  But it 's cheating in a way that 's pril It 's it 's announcing to everybody " hey , I 'm cheating , by doing this . "

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's saying so it 's all above the table .

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm actually using this other thing .

dialogue type : s
C :  That 's that 's that 's the reason .

dialogue type : s
C :  Bootstrapping would imply it was actually legitimate in some kind of way .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Anyway .

dialogue type : s^m^na
C :  It has some shock value .

dialogue type : s
C :  Which is part of why it 's used .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
C :  No , no . It has I don't think you 're saying the data is cheating .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  I think you 're saying " in my experiment , I cheated in this way " .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , another is what Liz was talking about , how in the Switchboard tests in all the Switchboard tests we 've been g doing , we 've been making the same er uh , same uh , uh , standard using the same standard way of of getting the data to test on .

dialogue type : s
C :  Which means that we weren't actually running it on on , uh , on data that had had no speech .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , in a sense , that was cheating .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  So i so it it 's it 's a good wake - up call if people " well , we have this performance but you have to keep in mind , we 're doing we 're we 're not doing the whole real task in this way and this way and this way .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , I 'll convince you that that it 's still important for you to listen to what I have to say next because of this and this . "

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah . Sure .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s:qo
C :  In the multi - band experiments , in the first one , we really wanted to find out , " what if you knew which band was really noisy ? "

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , suppose you just know that .

dialogue type : qo
C :  And then then , even if you know that , can that help you ?

dialogue type : qw
C :  I mean , what can what strategy can you do , to do well without that particular band in the spectrum ?

dialogue type : s
C :  And so that was important to know as a baseline .

dialogue type : s:qw
C :  And and then , once you knew that , then s you go " well , now how do I know that that 's noisy ? "

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  But , y you know , I I should also say that there 's a lot of It 's not just the word " cheating " . But there 's lots of other things that we talk about , which , as soon as you go outside of your narrow little group , it gets very , very confusing to people .

dialogue type : %-
C :  And I i i i

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , the example I was thinking of , also , was this w thing that that Herve and and Hynek and I made about , uh , increasing the error rate .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , so we we did a number of papers , and talks , and so forth about , uh w uh , i the the virtues of increasing the error rate .

dialogue type : s^f
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And I mean , and the whole point of it was , not that it was good to increase your error rate , but it was good to be willing to risk increasing your error rate by trying risky things , and trying Because there 's this notion of a local minimum , that if you just have some system that 's very complex ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and you t you you turn some knobs to try to make it better and better , you 'll never get out of this local minimum .

dialogue type : s
C :  You have to be willing to jump to something that 's quite different .

dialogue type : s
C :  And the first time you jump to something quite different , or maybe the first ten times or a hundred times you do , it 's gonna be much much worse ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because you 've optimized the other system .

dialogue type : s
C :  So the effect the immediate effect is gonna be to increase your error rate .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  And so it was we had a couple papers like " Towards increasing the error rate in speech " and and so on .

dialogue type : s
C :  And we really did get feedback from a few people , some of whom were , you know , fairly senior , that that , um , " Well , you know , you sh you you c We 're c really concerned about you misleading people into thinking they should be increasing the error rate . "

dialogue type : s
C :  And , uh , and we go we thought " Oh , come on . "

dialogue type : fh
C :  But .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  we weren't .

dialogue type : s
C :  That 's why we increased the error rate .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Anyway , it 's colloquial ,

dialogue type : s
C :  an and and , uh , it 's it 's interesting to hear that that someone coming from a different direction it s it sounds the way it sounds to you .

dialogue type : s
C :  But but , uh , I I 'd never heard that before .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  So , so i so , that 's interesting .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  Just so it doesn't when the microphone 's dead , it doesn't put out zeros ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  Or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  Johnson noise ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^nd.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  There 's tea , also , though .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  So , maybe we should maybe we should do a , uh , simultaneous digits digits read . In the interest of of getting the snacks .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bh^d^rt
C :  Oh , you never have ?

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Oh , it 's a treat .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : z
C :  OK , another successful babble .
