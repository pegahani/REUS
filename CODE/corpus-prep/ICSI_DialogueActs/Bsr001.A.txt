dialogue type : s
A :  The market is a captive market .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Good .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , basically , the the the original project looks a lot like , you know , the the p your project .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , basically we set up with this , uh , idea of the the the meeting the the mediated spaces idea in general

dialogue type : s
A :  and then incr incarnated in this room that will be mediated somehow by , you know , a computer to access information , to help along the meeting ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and will be like two kind of eh , f main functions .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  One is the interaction with the computer

dialogue type : s^e
A :  which , as you said , you know , is your interaction with the PDA in your case ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  where you kind of query it to ask for information , et cetera .

dialogue type : s
A :  At the same time , our process is somehow , you know , getting all this multi - channel information , doing some sort of , you know , cross , eh , channel , you know , cancellation and transcribing the individual streams ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  not necessarily in real time .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the idea is y you can eventually after the meeting query , you know , previous meetings

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  and there is all this work on transcription ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
A :  similar probably to what we do in Switchboard but with better bandwidth ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  you know ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  but worse , you know , environmental conditions .

dialogue type : s
A :  An - and then , you know , there is , all all these issues about processing all this information , you know , transcription ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  but then using , you know , prosody information to better , you know , segment , endpoint .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
A :  Eh , also using topic segmentation to help better classification of information or extraction of information .

dialogue type : fh
A :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  we didn't dare to say it will be just in a PDA you throw in the middle of a meeting .

dialogue type : s
A :  That that was daring .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
A :  But , you know , uh let 's assume somehow the compu processor power is going to be there .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Whatever .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  I I mean , ou uh we we kind of set up this concept like a year and a half ago .

dialogue type : s:s^co
A :  And at that time I said , you know , we said , " don't worry about the the compute power " .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I mean , it will be somewhere , you know .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I mean , our approach , somehow , I mean , I believe it 's probably , you know , complimentary in many ways , is to focus on the actual deep technology that we have somehow in speech . And basically , make progress on , you know , the algorithms .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then , you know , it will run somewhere .

dialogue type : fh
A :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s
A :  as you said , to I mean , we would like the idea to have it there

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but but our focus is basically to develop the algorithms , to push the state of the art on this transcription task .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  And , uh , the other task probably is also , you know , challenging the comp the the querying , uh , the command , control , or , you know , I mean , doing that in natural language .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  You really are challenged to do that ,

dialogue type : s^bu^e
A :  to put as much power as you can in the PDA .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , our approach is , you know , we do whatever is necessary to do it

dialogue type : s
A :  and , you know , some of it may go into something , depending on , you know , your scalable power .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , you know , is , eventually y you will get all this you know , sc eh , higher and higher , you know , powers in these portable things .

dialogue type : s
A :  So as long as you have enough algorithms and technology to do something better if you have more processing power .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , the the situation now in the speech community is that , you know , there is some boundary , some limit in the performance .

dialogue type : s
A :  And no matter how much processing you throw in , you don't get any better .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so we are trying to push that .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then you have room to port whatever you can to , you know , smaller devices .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^fa|s
A :  Sorry I interrupt you .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , it 's one of the areas where Kemal is going to work , like , you know , speaker tracking , and speaker ID .

dialogue type : fh
A :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s
A :  you want to know .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I mean , if you have the people wired individually it probably is easier .

dialogue type : s
A :  But but you know , in in the other situation , you know .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^ar

dialogue type : s^df^nd
A :  Um , you need a task to really , you know , improve your system for that particular environment .

dialogue type : s
A :  So right now we are focusing our research on doing evaluation type of , you know , in incremental you know , improvements .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Switchboard , for instance .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^e
A :  OK , you have two people talking ,

dialogue type : s
A :  it 's the closest thing .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  But we really should move into the you know , data that reflects as much as possible , the real scenario .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  And that that 's a way to improve .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  And then you do improvement on that particular database .

dialogue type : s
A :  So even if we don't collect the data to train models , we should collect data at least to evaluate progress .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^t3

dialogue type : s^cs

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  phone meetings or something .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  At the same time we contribute to the database collection ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  and , uh .

dialogue type : s
A :  But it will be all documented .

dialogue type : qw^rt

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  So so , I One question .

dialogue type : s
A :  I I mean , I haven't been in these , uh , you know , preliminary de decision meetings ,

dialogue type : s^no
A :  but I don't know what 's the idea for the computer interaction .

dialogue type : qy^d
A :  I mean , it 's going to be a real computer , as in Wizard of Oz ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  And so it will be a real computer recognition .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK , OK , OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So somebody will be playing the recognizer

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  and then other agents will be doing their task independently .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Good .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  You p you plan to to train actually models based on this data .

A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s

dialogue type : s^e
