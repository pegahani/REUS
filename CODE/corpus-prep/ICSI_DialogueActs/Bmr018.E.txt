dialogue type : z
E :  We 're recording .

dialogue type : z
E :  I pre - crashed it .

dialogue type : z
E :  I think it 's actually

dialogue type : z
E :  it depends on if the temp files are there or not ,

dialogue type : z
E :  that at least that 's my current working hypothesis ,

dialogue type : z
E :  that I think what happens is it tries to clear the temp files and if they 're too big , it crashes .

dialogue type : z
E :  Oh , that 's right .

dialogue type : z
E :  Uh , no , it doesn't it doesn't clear those necessarily ,

dialogue type : z
E :  so .

dialogue type : z
E :  It 's i they 're called temp files ,

dialogue type : z
E :  but they 're not actually in the temp directory they 're in the scratch ,

dialogue type : z
E :  so .

dialogue type : z
E :  They 're not backed up , but they 're not erased either on power failure .

dialogue type : z
E :  Oh well .

dialogue type : z
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
E :  Yep ,

dialogue type : z
E :  and then everyone can listen to it later .

dialogue type : z
E :  Yes . Absolutely .

dialogue type : z
E :  It 's what it sounds like .

dialogue type : s^t
E :  I Since I 've been gone all week , I didn't send out a reminder for an agenda ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  so .

dialogue type : qr^t
E :  Do we have anything to talk about or should we just read digits and go ?

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah , really .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
E :  It 's all a blur .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^bs
E :  A week from Saturday .

dialogue type : sj^ba
E :  That 's good .

dialogue type : %-
E :  Well , y

dialogue type : s
E :  Eurospeech is due on Friday

dialogue type : s
E :  and then I 'm going down to San uh , San Jose Friday night ,

dialogue type : s
E :  so , if you know , if we start nice and late Saturday that 's a good thing .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  Seattle .

dialogue type : s^bs
E :  They 're flying from somewhere to somewhere ,

dialogue type : fg|s^cs^t
E :  But , uh , yeah maybe an agenda , or at least some things to talk about would be a good idea .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  So have you heard back from Brian about that ,

dialogue type : s
E :  Chuck ?

dialogue type : sj^ba
E :  Great .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  So , uh , oh , though Thi - Thilo isn't here ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  um , but , uh ,

dialogue type : s.x
E :  I I have the program to insert the beeps .

dialogue type : s
E :  What I don't have is something to parse the output of the channelized transcripts to find out where to put the beeps ,

dialogue type : sj
E :  but that should be really easy to do .

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  So do we have a meeting that that 's been done with ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
E :  that we 've tightened it up to the point where we can actually give it to IBM and have them try it out ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  Well we had we had talked about doing maybe EDU as a good choice , though .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , whatever we have .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^am
E :  Yeah , maybe it doesn't matter .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^rt
E :  OK , and has it been corrected ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  Hand - checked ?

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Cuz that was one of the processes we were talking about as well .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  And time how long it takes .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^no
E :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  it seems to me w we probably should go ahead and do a whole meeting

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because we 'll have to transcribe the whole meeting anyway sometime .

dialogue type : sj
E :  Like I I mean I guess if we have to do it again anyway ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  but , uh

dialogue type : sj.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^fe|s^bsc
E :  Wow , excuse me , two or more times real time ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  right ?

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Cuz they have to at least listen to it .

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  Well the other stuff is I B

dialogue type : sj
E :  I 'm just thinking that from a data keeping - track - of - the - data point of view , it may be best to send them whole meetings at a time and not try to send them bits and pieces .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  That was the question . Though .

dialogue type : fg|s^no.%-
E : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  I mean , h they they typically work for what , four hours , something like that ?

dialogue type : sj
E :  I think the they should be able to get through a whole meeting in one sitting .

dialogue type : sj
E :  I would think ,

dialogue type : s
E :  unless it 's a lot harder than we think it is ,

dialogue type : s
E :  which it could be , certainly .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Or seven or eight .

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  That 's what it seems to me too , in that if they need to , just like in the other cases , they can listen to the individual , if they need to .

dialogue type : s
E :  But they don't have to for most of it .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , they have the normal channeltrans interface where they have each individual speaker has their own line ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but you 're listening to the mixed signal and you 're tightening the boundaries ,

dialogue type : s^bsc
E :  correcting the boundaries .

dialogue type : s
E :  You shouldn't have to tighten them too much because Thilo 's program does that .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Uh - huh !

dialogue type : s^fa
E :  Sorry .

dialogue type : s^cc^j
E :  I 'll work on that .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Well , so so that 's something that the transcribers will have to have to do .

dialogue type : s^nd.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^nd.x
E :  but then they for this meeting they would have to do seven times real time , and it would probably be more than that .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
E :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Because they 'd have to at least listen to each channel all the way through .

dialogue type : s^bu
E :  Oh , you 're talking about visually .

dialogue type : s^nd.%-
E : 

dialogue type : sj
E :  Yeah , and I I think that they 're going much more on acoustics than they are on visuals .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah , that 's actually true .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah , you 're right .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  You 're absolutely right .

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah , I found the same thing that when I was scanning through the wave form I could see when someone started to read digits just by the shapes .

dialogue type : s^am
E :  Um , maybe .

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
E :  N the t

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  Well , they wouldn't look at it at this point .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  They would just listen .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , the problem is that the the interface doesn't really allow you to switch visuals .

dialogue type : s
E :  The problem is that that the Tcl - TK interface with the visuals , it 's very slow to load waveforms .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  And so when I tried that that was the first thing I tried when I first started it ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
E :  right ?

dialogue type : s
E :  Well it it does some sort of shape pre - computation so that it can then scroll it quickly ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  But then you can't change the resolution or scroll quickly .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  I mean , we we could do different interfaces ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  right ?

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  I mean , so so we could use like X Waves instead of Transcriber ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  and it loads faster , certainly .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well that 's what I tried originally .

dialogue type : s
E :  So I I actually before , uh , Dave Gelbart did this , I did an interface which showed each waveform and ea a ribbon for each waveform ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but the problem with it is even with just three waveforms it was just painfully slow to scroll .

dialogue type : s^fe
E :  So you just scroll a screen and it would , you know go " kur - chunk ! "

dialogue type : s
E :  And so it just was not doable with the current interface .

dialogue type : sj^cs
E :  I think that if we decide that we need that they need to see the visuals , we need to change the interface so that they can do that .

dialogue type : %-
E :  An

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^m^t1
E :  The chopped up waveforms .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
E :  And wouldn't that be the same as the mixed signal ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  The mixed signal , the overlaps are pretty audible because it is volume equalized .

dialogue type : s
E :  So I think they should be able to hear .

dialogue type : s
E :  The only problem is is , you know , counting how many and if they 're really correct or not .

dialogue type : fh|s^no
E :  So , I don't know .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^arp^df
E :  Right but but once once you know that they happen , you can at least listen to the close talking ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  so .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
E :  Right ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  so so

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  did Dave Did Dave do that change where you can actually just click rather than having to go up to the menu to listen to the individual channels ?

dialogue type : s
E :  I had suggested it before .

dialogue type : s
E :  I just don't know whether he did it or not .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  We should get him to do that

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because , uh , I think that would be much , much faster than going to the menu .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  Then maybe just buttons down at the bottom next to it .

dialogue type : s
E :  Just something so that it 's not in the menu option so that you can do it much faster .

dialogue type : fg|s:qy
E :  Well it just seems to me that if you wanna quickly " well was that Jane , no , was that Chuck , no , was that Morgan " , right now , you have to go up to the menu ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and each time , go up to the menu , select it , listen to that channel then click below ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and then go back to the menu , select the next one , and then click below .

dialogue type : s
E :  So you can definitely streamline that with the i with the interface .

dialogue type : qw
E :  What ?

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  I would like to try to do something on digits

dialogue type : s
E :  but I just don't know if we have time .

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , it 's due next Friday

dialogue type : s
E :  so we have to do the experiments and write the paper .

dialogue type : fh|s^cc
E :  So , I 'm gonna try ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  but , uh ,

dialogue type : s
E :  we 'll just have to see .

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  So actually I wanna get together with both Andreas and , uh , uh , Stephane with their respective systems .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and I haven't had s chance to sit down and listen .

dialogue type : s^cc
E :  I was going to do that this afternoon .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Well , Morgan and I were were having a debate about that .

dialogue type : sj
E :  Whereas I think it it 's probably something pathologic

dialogue type : sj
E :  and actually Stephane 's results , I think confirm that .

dialogue type : s
E :  He s he did the Aurora system

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  also got very lousy average error , like fifteen or or , uh , fifteen to twenty percent average ?

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  But then he ran it just on the lapel , and got about five or six percent word error ?

dialogue type : sj
E :  So that that means to me that somewhere in the other recordings there are some pathological cases .

dialogue type : fh|s^am
E :  But , you know , we th that may not be true .

dialogue type : s^am
E :  It may be just some of the segments they 're just doing a lousy job on .

dialogue type : s^cc
E :  So I 'll I 'll listen to it and find out since you 'd actually split it up by segment .

dialogue type : s
E :  So I can actually listen to it .

dialogue type : s
E :  Oh , I thought he had sent that around to everyone ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  did you just sent that to me ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
E :  It was bimodal .

dialogue type : qy^bh|s^bk
E :  Oh , was it trimodal , OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  A bug is what I mean ,

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  Which probably means like there was a th the recording interface crashed ,

dialogue type : s
E :  or there was a short you know , someone was jiggling with a cord

dialogue type : s
E :  or , uh , I extracted it incorrectly ,

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  it was transcribed incorrectly ,

dialogue type : s
E :  something really bad happened ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and I just haven't listened to it yet to find out what it was .

dialogue type : s
E :  There 's a lot .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  A normal .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Yeah , cuz some of our non - natives are pretty non - native .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  c High correlation .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Um - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt.x
E :  Well . are you talking about the fact that the recording software doesn't do time - synchronous ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  Is that what you 're referring to ?

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  I didn't think so either .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
E :  Right , which should be pretty straight forward .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah . That 's what I was gonna say .

dialogue type : %-
E :  C

dialogue type : s.%
E :  Oh , MNCM .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm !

dialogue type : s^bs
E :  So a meeting with me in it .

dialogue type : s^fe
E :  Ugh !

dialogue type : s^t1
E :  I forgot the digital camera again .

dialogue type : s^e^t1
E :  Every meeting !

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  Two words .

dialogue type : s^aa|%-
E :  Thilo 's will . But .

dialogue type : fg|s^am^rt
E :  Well maybe Maybe that will get enough of the cases to be useful .

dialogue type : s
E :  You know s cuz it seemed like most of the cases are in fact the single word sorts ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  or at least a single phrase

dialogue type : s^e
E :  in most of the bins .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm !

dialogue type : b
E :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
E :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  Tools .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  And we 'll just have to see how hard that is .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  So so whether the corrections take too much time .

dialogue type : s
E :  I was just thinking about the fact that if Thilo 's missed these short segments , that might be quite time - consuming for them to insert them .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  Spurious .

dialogue type : sj
E :  It might be easier to delete something that 's wrong than to insert something that 's missing .

dialogue type : qw^rt
E :  What do you think , Jane ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  Cuz then then you just delete it , and you don't have to pick a time .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Yeah , I guess the semantics aren't clear when you delete a segment ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  right ?

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Because you would say You would have to determine what the surroundings were .

dialogue type : s
E :  If it 's really a noise .

dialogue type : qr^d
E :  To add or to delete ?

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^am
E :  That Maybe that 's an interface issue that might be addressable .

dialogue type : sj
E :  But I think it 's the semantics that are that are questionable to me ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  So let 's say someone is talking to here , and then you have a little segment here .

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  Well , is that part of the speech ?

dialogue type : qy
E :  Is it part of the nonspeech ?

dialogue type : qw
E :  I mean , w what do you embed it in ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  Oh that 's what you meant by just put an " X " there .

dialogue type : sj^ba
E :  Uh , that 's an interesting idea .

dialogue type : s^bs
E :  So so all they So that all they would have to do is put like an " X " there .

dialogue type : s
E :  So blank for blank for silence , " S "

dialogue type : s
E :  " S " for speech , " X "

dialogue type : s
E :  " X " for something else .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , I think we 'll have to , eventually .

dialogue type : s.x

dialogue type : s^j

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^m

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj

dialogue type : s
E :  He he he was onto the bullet points about talking about the you know the little hand - held , and trying to get lower power and so on ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and Microsoft pops up a little window saying " Your batteries are now fully charged . "

dialogue type : s^j^rt

dialogue type : s^2

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : fh

dialogue type : s^2

E :  They seemed like a good group .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  The - their Broadcast News was their acoustic models

dialogue type : s
E :  and then all the other tasks were much simpler .

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  So they were command and control and that sort of thing .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  Yeah , read Wall Street Journal .

dialogue type : s
E :  It works .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah , that was one of the ones that I liked .

dialogue type : s
E :  That It not only works , in some cases it was better ,

dialogue type : s
E :  which I thought was pretty interesting ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  but that 's cuz they didn't control for parameters .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : s
E :  You know , the Broadcast News nets were not nets ,

dialogue type : s
E :  acoustic models were a lot more complex .

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  n Not in that paper .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Yeah , well , one of the big problems with that is is often the simpler task isn't fully doesn't have all the phones in it ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and that that makes it very hard .

dialogue type : s
E :  But I 've done the same thing .

dialogue type : s
E :  I 've been using Broadcast News nets for digits ,

dialogue type : s^f^rt
E :  like for the spr speech proxy thing that I did ?

dialogue type : s
E :  That 's what I did .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  So . It works .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bc
E :  You mean they have some .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  Present .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  Do a trip report .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  A lot of different ones .

dialogue type : s
E :  Mitre , BBN , IBM .

dialogue type : h
E :  Uh ,

dialogue type : qw
E :  Wasn't Who who who did the order one ?

dialogue type : h|sj
E :  Ugh ! I 'm just so bad at that .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  Yeah , we do have word transcripts .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^j
E :  Someone who actually does take notes ,

dialogue type : s^t3
E :  um , I 'm very bad at note - taking .

dialogue type : s^t3
E :  I always write down the wrong things .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  A judge .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
E :  And as I said , I like the Microsoft talk on scaling issues in , uh , word sense disambiguation ,

dialogue type : sj^ba
E :  that was interesting .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  It it it was the only one It was the only one that had any sort of real disagreement about .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg|s^ng
E :  Well , it sort of was .

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
E :  Them being beep , they went off to a billion .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|sj
E :  Well , I think the reason they can do that , is that they assumed that text that they get off the web , like from Wall Street Journal , is correct , and edit it .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  So that 's what they used as training data .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's just saying if it 's in this corpus it 's correct .

dialogue type : s^2^rt
E :  Are irrelevant .

dialogue type : fg.%
E : 

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No , but there was still a spread .

dialogue type : s^nd.%--
E :  They weren't all up

dialogue type : s^bc^nd
E :  They weren't converging .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  They were all still spread .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right , right .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  But they hadn't even come close to that point .

dialogue type : s
E :  All the tasks were still improving when they hit a billion .

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  But they didn't get closer .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  They just switched position .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%
E :  It was Liz .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  But , I think one of their p They they had a couple points .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  w Uh , I think one of them was that " Well , maybe simpler algorithms and more data are is better " .

dialogue type : s
E :  Less memory ,

dialogue type : s
E :  faster operation ,

dialogue type : s
E :  simpler .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
E :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
E :  Because their simplest , most brain - dead algorithm did pretty darn well

dialogue type : s^e
E :  when you got gave it a lot more data .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then also they were saying , " Well , m You have access to a lot more data .

dialogue type : qw
E :  Why are you sticking with a million words ? "

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , their point was that this million - word corpus that everyone uses is apparently ten or fifteen years old .

dialogue type : s
E :  And everyone is still using it ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  so .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  But we could talk about this stuff ,

dialogue type : sj
E :  I think this would be fun to do .

dialogue type : b.x
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  Machine - learning .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Or you only have a million words for your some new task .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa^m
E :  Cost .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  That 's a big one .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah , so that 's one of the slides they put up .

dialogue type : s^2^m
E :  Forty - five years of research .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
E :  I think the matters is the thing that that was misleading .

dialogue type : s
E :  Is that all all of them are based on all the others ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : fh
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  And I 'm saying the same thing happened with speech recognition ,

dialogue type : qh
E :  right ?

dialogue type : s
E :  For a long time people were hand - c coding linguistic rules

dialogue type : s^e^rt
E :  and then they discovered machine - learning worked better .

dialogue type : s
E :  And now they 're throwing more and more data and worrying perhaps worrying less and less about , uh , the exact details of the algorithms .

dialogue type : s
E :  Except when they have a Eurospeech paper .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Anyway .

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt^t
E :  Shall we read some digits ?

dialogue type : qr
E :  Are we gonna do one at a time ? Or should we read them all agai at once again .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cc
E :  So remember to read the transcript number so that , uh , everyone knows that what it is .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  And ready ?

dialogue type : s
E :  Three , two , one .

dialogue type : z
E :  Yep . That 's really fast .
