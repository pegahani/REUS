dialogue type : fg
B :  OK

dialogue type : fg
B :  So

dialogue type : fh|s^t
B :  uh today we 're looking at a number of uh things we 're trying

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  and uh fortunately for listeners to this uh we lost some of it 's visual

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  but um got tables in front of us .

dialogue type : fh|qw^rt
B :  Um what is what does combo mean ?

dialogue type : fg|s^cc
B :  Um so let me try to restate this and see if I have it right .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
B :  There is uh there is the features uh there 's the OGI features and then um those features um go through a contextual uh

dialogue type : s
B :  l l let 's take this bottom arr one pointed to by the bottom arrow .

dialogue type : fh|s^bu
B :  Um those features go through a contextualized KLT .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  Then these features also uh get um low - pass filtered

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Yeah , that 's good .

dialogue type : x
B :  So

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Three , OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : sj^fe
B :  Aha !

dialogue type : sj^fe
B :  aha !

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  No , the KLT .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  And those two together .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's it .

dialogue type : s
B :  OK so that 's that 's this bottom one .

dialogue type : fh|s
B : 

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  and I presume these things that uh are in yellow are in yellow because overall they 're the best ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^co
B :  Oh let 's focus on them then

dialogue type : qw
B :  so what 's the block diagram for the one above it ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Do you e um they mentioned made some uh when I was on the phone with Sunil they they mentioned some weighting scheme that was used to evaluate all of these numbers .

dialogue type : fg|qy^d
B :  Um and we don't have the TI - digits part yet ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  And so have you put all these numbers together into a single number representing that ?

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  then we could compare the two and say what was better .

dialogue type : fh|qw
B : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
B :  oh so OGI two is just the top top row ?

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s^bu
B :  Uh OK so the one one place where it looks like we 're messing things up a bit is in the highly mismatched Italian .

dialogue type : %-
B :  An

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Now up

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Uh so one of the ideas that you had mentioned last time was having a a second um silence detection .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  So filt is what that is ?

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  Oh we can't do it .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : sj^by
B :  Too bad

dialogue type : sj^ba^by
B :  Good idea , but can't do it .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
B :  So

dialogue type : s
B :  Alright so for now at least that 's not there

dialogue type : s
B :  you have some results with low - pass filter cepstrum

dialogue type : s
B :  doesn't have a huge effect but it but it looks like it you know maybe could help in a couple places .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh little bit .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um and um um

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah

dialogue type : fh
B :  and uh let 's see

dialogue type : qw
B :  What else did we have in there ?

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B :  Uh I guess it makes a l um at this point this is

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  I I guess I should probably look at these others a little bit

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  uh And you you yellowed these out

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh but uh uh

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Oh I see yeah that that one you can't use because of the delay .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Those look pretty good .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um let 's see that one

dialogue type : s|qy^bu^d^g^rt
B :  Well even the just the the second row doesn't look that bad right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  That 's just uh

dialogue type : %
B :  yeah ?

dialogue type : sj
B :  And and that looks like an interesting one too .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Yeah so when we do this weighted measure we should compare the two cuz it might even come out better .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  And it 's it 's it 's a little slightly simpler .

dialogue type : s
B :  So so there 's so I I would put that one also as a as a maybe .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  yeah and it 's actually does does significantly better on the uh uh highly mismatched Italian ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so s

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and little worse on the mis on the MM case ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  uh Well yeah it 's worse than a few things

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  so uh let 's see how that c that c c see how that comes out on their their measure

dialogue type : qy
B :  and are are we running this uh for TI - digits

dialogue type : qr.%--
B :  or uh

dialogue type : qy
B :  Now is TI di is is that part of the result that they get for the uh development th the results that they 're supposed to get at the end of end of the month , the TI - digits are there also ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  And see what else there is here .

dialogue type : s^bk
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  the one I was looking down here at the the o the row below the lower yellowed one .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh that 's uh that 's with the reduced uh KLT size reduced dimensionality .

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  What happens there is it 's around the same

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and so you could reduce the dimension as you were saying before a bit perhaps .

dialogue type : s^na
B : 

dialogue type : s^na
B :  it 's it 's uh it 's it 's mostly worse .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  But it is little .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I mean not not by a huge amount ,

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : qw
B :  What are what are the sizes of any of these sets ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I I 'm I 'm sure you told me before , but I 've forgotten .

dialogue type : qw
B :  So you know how many words are in uh one of these test sets ?

dialogue type : qy^d
B :  About ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So the so the sets so the test sets are between five hundred and two thousand sentences , let 's say

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  and each sentence on the average has four or five digits

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B :  or is it most of them longer or

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
B :  Right , so between one and sixteen .

dialogue type : s^df|qy^d^g
B :  See the I mean the reason I 'm asking is is is we have all these small differences and I don't know how seriously to take them , right ?

dialogue type : fh|s^bu
B :  So uh i if if you had uh just you know to give an example , if you had uh um if you had a thousand words then uh a a tenth of a percent would just be one word ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So so it wouldn't mean anything .

dialogue type : b
B :  Oh

dialogue type : fh|s^co
B :  um so um yeah it be kind of I 'd kind of like to know what the sizes of these test sets were actually .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  well also just to know the numbers ,

dialogue type : b
B :  right .

dialogue type : s
B :  So these these are word error rates

dialogue type : qy^d
B :  so this is on how many words .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah

dialogue type : s^co
B :  so anyway if you could just mail out what those numbers are and then then that that be great .

dialogue type : fh|qw
B :  Um what else is there here ?

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um see the second second from the bottom it says SIL ,

dialogue type : qy^d.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qw
B :  what was that ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh , uh - huh .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  The silence plus the KLT output ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  Oh so you 're only using the silence .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qw
B :  And what and what 's OGI forty - five ?

dialogue type : qy^d
B :  The bottom one there ?

dialogue type : %-
B :  S

dialogue type : s^bk|qw
B :  Right , but I mean what 's the what does the last row mean ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I thought that was the one I thought that was the second row .

dialogue type : qw.%-
B :  So what 's the difference between the second

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So this is like the second line but with with the combo stuff .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B :  alright

dialogue type : s^bs
B : 

dialogue type : s^na
B :  given that we have to take the filt ones out of the the running because of this delay problem so it looks to me like the ones you said I agree are are the ones to look at

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  but I just would add the the the second row one

dialogue type : fh
B :  and then um if we can um

dialogue type : qr
B :  oh yeah also when when they 're using this weighting scheme of forty , thirty - five , twenty - five is that on the percentages or on the raw errors ?

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
B :  I guess it 's probably on the percentages right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  Maybe maybe they 'll argue about it .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um OK

dialogue type : s^co
B :  so if we can know what how many words are in each

dialogue type : s
B :  and then um Dave uh Dave promised to get us something tomorrow which will be there as far as they 've gotten Friday

dialogue type : s
B :  and then we 'll operate with that

dialogue type : qw.%--
B :  and uh how long did it

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I guess if we 're not doing all these things if we 're only doing um

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  um I guess since this is development data it 's legitimate to do more than one ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean ordinarily if in final test data you don't want to do several and and take the best

dialogue type : s
B :  that 's that 's that 's not proper

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  but if this is development data we could still look at a couple .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : x
B :  I

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  But the question is when when do we fix the system ,

dialogue type : qr
B :  do we fix the system uh tomorrow or do we fix the system on Tuesday ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  I Yeah , OK except that we do have to write it up .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Also , so

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  so maybe what we do is we we we uh as soon as we get the data from them we start the training and so forth

dialogue type : s^co
B :  but we start the write - up right away because as you say there there 's only minor differences between these .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , and and I I would you know , I would I 'd kind of like to see it

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  maybe I can I can edit it a bit

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh sure .

dialogue type : s
B :  The my what in this si i in this situation is my forte which is English .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh so

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh H yeah .

dialogue type : qy
B :  Have y have you seen alt d do they have a format for how they want the system descriptions or anything ?

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : x
B :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Uh I see .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yes , for those who are listening to this and not looking at it uh it 's not really that impressive , it 's just tiny .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's all these little categories set a , set b , set c , multi - condition , clean .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh No mitigation .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Wow .

dialogue type : qy
B :  Do you know what no what no mitigation means here ?

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  this is probably channel error stuff

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  huh ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh this is i right , it says right above here channel channel error resilience ,

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  So recognition performance is just the top part , actually .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh and they have yes , split between seen databases and non - seen so basically between development and and evaluation .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  right ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it 's presumed there 's all sorts of tuning that 's gone on on the see what they call seen databases

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and there won't be tuning for the uh unseen .

dialogue type : s
B :  Multi - condition multi - condition .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So they have looks like they have

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh uh

dialogue type : s|s^bk
B :  so they splitting up between the TI - digits and everything else , I see .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  So the everything else is the SpeechDat - Car , that 's the multi multilingual

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  Well , it is .

dialogue type : s^ar^r
B :  It is ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but there 's also there 's these tables over here for the for the TI - digits and these tables over here for the car data

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which is which is I guess all the multilingual stuff

dialogue type : s
B :  and then uh there 's they also split up between multi - condition and clean only .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So we 're doing that also , I guess .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Well anyway , sounds like there 'll be a lot to do just to work with our partners to fill out the tables over the next uh next few days

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  let 's see the thirty - first is uh uh Wednesday

dialogue type : s
B :  and I think the it has to be there by some hour uh European time on Wednesday

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  so I think basically

dialogue type : qo^br^rt
B :  E excuse me ?

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yes , so I mean I think we have to actually get it done Tuesday

dialogue type : fh
B :  right

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  because I I think

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh Uh

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah well .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  was like I thought it was five PM or something ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I didn't think it was midnight .

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
B :  I thought they said they wanted everything by

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B :  if

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  three PM .

dialogue type : s
B :  Alright , that 's six in the morning here .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Yes , yes , but I didn't think it was midnight that it was due ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I thought it was due at some hour during the day like five PM or something .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  In which case

dialogue type : s^co
B :  so I I uh well we should look

dialogue type : s
B :  but my assumption is that we basically have to be done Tuesday .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um so then next Thursday we can sort of have a little aftermath

dialogue type : s
B :  but then then we 'll actually have the new data which is the German and the Danish

dialogue type : s
B :  but that really will be much less work because uh the system will be fixed

dialogue type : s^co
B :  so all we 'll do is take whatever they have and and uh and run it through the process .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh we won't be changing the training on anything

dialogue type : s
B :  so there 'll be no new training , there 'll just be new HTK runs ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so that 's means in some sense we can kind of relax from this after after Tuesday

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
B :  and and uh maybe next meeting we can start talking a little bit about where we want to go from here uh in terms of uh the research .

dialogue type : fh|qw^cs
B :  Um you know what things uh did you think of when you were uh doing this process that uh you just didn't really have time to adequately work on

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh uh so

dialogue type : qo
B :  What ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  But they 're ideas .

dialogue type : qo^d^g
B :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Oh , that was good .

dialogue type : s
B :  And and uh also it 's still true that uh I think it 's true that that we we at least got fairly consistent i improved results by running uh the uh neural net transformation in parallel with the features

dialogue type : s
B :  rather than uh in sequence which was was your suggestion and that that that seems to have been borne out .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  most improvements aren't enormous

dialogue type : fh
B :  and uh

dialogue type : s
B :  some of them are

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  but uh I mean you have something really really wrong and you fix it you can get big and really enormous improvements

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  but uh um Cuz our best improvements over the years that we 've gotten from finding bugs ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  but

dialogue type : fh
B :  Anyway

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK

dialogue type : s^bs|qo
B :  well I I think I see where we are and everybody knows what they 're doing and is there is there anything else we should talk about

dialogue type : qrr
B :  or or are we done ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Yeah , I mean that would be pretty low maintenance to try it .

dialogue type : fh|s^aap
B :  Uh if you can fit it in .

dialogue type : s^cc^tc
B :  Oh I have yeah I do have one other piece of information which uh I should tell people outside of this group too

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  uh I don't know if we 're gonna need it uh but uh Jeff up at the uh University of Washington has uh gotten a hold of a uh uh some kind of server farm of uh of ten uh uh multiprocessor uh IBM machines RS six thousands

dialogue type : s
B :  and and uh so I think each one is four processors or something or I don't know , eight hundred megahertz or something

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  and there 's four processors in a box and there 's ten boxes and there 's some kind of ti

dialogue type : s
B :  so if you know he 's got a lot of processing power

dialogue type : fh
B :  and um

dialogue type : s
B :  we 'd have to schedule it

dialogue type : s
B :  but if we have some big jobs and we wanna wanna wanna run them he 's he 's offering it .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : %--
B :  It 's uh

dialogue type : s
B :  when he was here eh uh he he used i not only every machine here but every machine on campus as far as I could tell ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  so in some ways he just got his payback ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but uh again I I don't know if we 'll end up with if we 're gonna be CPU limited on anything that we 're doing in this group

dialogue type : s
B :  but but if if we are that 's an offer .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK

dialogue type : fh|s^ba^tc
B :  well uh you guys doing great stuff so that 's that that 's really neat

dialogue type : fh
B :  and uh

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  we 'll uh uh g don't think we need to uh

dialogue type : fh|s^t^tc
B :  um Oh well the other thing I guess that I will say is that uh the digits that we 're gonna record momentarily is starting to get are starting to get into a pretty good size collection

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  and um in addition to the SpeechDat stuff we will have those to work with really pretty soon now

dialogue type : s
B :  so that 's that 's another source of data .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
B :  Um which is s under somewhat better control and that we can we can make measurements of the room

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  the uh that you know if we feel there 's other measurements we don't have that we 'd like to have we can make them

dialogue type : fh
B :  and

dialogue type : s
B :  uh Dave and I were just talking about that a little while ago

dialogue type : s
B :  so uh that 's another another possibility for this this kind of work .

dialogue type : s^co^t^tc
B :  K , uh if nobody has anything else maybe we should go around do do our digits do our digits duty .

dialogue type : fh
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  OK I 'll start .

dialogue type : z
B :  Uh , let me say that again .

dialogue type : z
B :  OK . I guess we 're done .
