dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  This afternoon you mean ?

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
C :  No , this was unrelated to to the things of yesterday and last weeks

dialogue type : %-
C :  wha

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , and This probably has to be a brainstorm right now .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Um What I told Joachim yesterday was that , uh uh for my company the company I work for , they are more interested in in an explicit service , than in core technology .

dialogue type : %
C :  u

dialogue type : s
C :  Me , on the other hand , I 'm more interested in uh , core service , or c core technology , myself .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I 'm u I was thinking about uh , how I could combine the both of them .

dialogue type : s
C :  KPN was , um they 're interested in having , uh like , six people or something , working on the project for one year

dialogue type : s
C :  or maybe , uh , three people fo working on the project for two years ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and have a kind of a demonstration uh , for a specifically in UMTS service .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  I was thinking that um as a well , not really a UMTS service , but yesterday , what I discussed with Joachim was uh , a w little bit based on your ad - hoc networking also .

dialogue type : s
C :  That it would be interesting to have a kind of a device where you can switch from w a WaveLAN Technology to , um , UMTS .

dialogue type : s
C :  I think that 's , uh , it 's in in the future that will be a main competitor of , uh , of UMTS ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  too , like the the the Lucent , uh , equipment has a l huge scope already ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  like five hundred feet , or or even more sometimes .

dialogue type : s
C :  so that 's it 's might be interesting for , a service to walk into a building or whatever is available on that network .

dialogue type : s
C :  You can switch from UMTS or uh uh , to WaveLAN Technologies .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Sure .

dialogue type : s
C :  Of course , it sounds strange for a company that does UMTS to switch to to be able to switch or provide the service to switch to WaveLAN

dialogue type : s^df
C :  but at the end it makes it easier for your and cheaper for your customers .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  So , if they don't do it , somebody else will probably do it .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^na
C :  Yeah , something like that could be possible ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  maybe even a UMTS - to - WaveLAN - gateway ,

dialogue type : s^df^no
C :  or I 'm not sure if that 's possible like we U - if UMTS re contains redirects or whatever , like switches .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I 'm not sure about it .

dialogue type : s
C :  It could be .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's not a problem .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  No , but s You could have a UMTS gateway that translates everything to that uh w local @ @ .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  If you will

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : h
C :  Well ,

dialogue type : s^no
C :  If connection is lost , I am I 'm not sure if sometimes you 'd simply have to drop a connection . If you have outstanding connections .

dialogue type : s
C :  But that 's uh one thing of the internet ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's should be able to unplug a host , bring it somewhere else and everything continues like it should be .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I 'm not sure i if it 's uh if you really have to con uh save a connection for all applications ,

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  I I don't think so .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bu^d
C :  Oh , the one I have Sitcom ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^am
C :  Well , the switching itself could be a problem .

dialogue type : s^am
C :  Becau - well it 's a depends

dialogue type : s^am
C :  if one of the other networks is available , maybe you are ,

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  So that could be a t topic for research ,

dialogue type : s^am
C :  so maybe you know more about it .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Y Yes .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^ba^cs
C :  If if you can leave it out the network that will be really cool .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  That 's what you w what I would like to do ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
C :  The the thing is that we are looking for a research topic on on those uh four areas .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  So so we went through uh uh to through multicast .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So this architecture with m

dialogue type : s
C :  well , at least no wireless environment or a mobile IP environment , comparable to uh UMTS environments . We really did not find any well , difficulties there .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  On the blackboard , that is .

dialogue type : s
C :  Of course , in real life there will b probably be some problems .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  Iceberg ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  You mean the Iceberg project ?

dialogue type : s^bk.%-
C :  Barwan of uh ES

dialogue type : s
C :  I know there 's one that 's of uh Randy Katz .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  They worked together wi little bit with Nokia ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  Palo Alto ?

dialogue type : qy^d
C :  Mountain View ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  I like them

dialogue type : fh
C :  so

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Or maybe talk to them about s operations they thought of but didn't touch yet .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  Wh - when did you go through this ?

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Cuz yesterday I was uh Well coincidentally , I b bumped into this project here .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  It 's funny .

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , yesterday I was just surfing a little bit .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then from Nokia I came to this that project ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so .

dialogue type : s
C :  Nokia research .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s
C :  And he 's also board in Nokia research ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , just to make the list a little bit longer .

dialogue type : %--
C :  May

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
C :  Um , you could also think about uh session management .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I do along with uh the network applications and services , uh as you might know .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  It 's a a

dialogue type : s^df
C :  if you can do it in the end systems or at sp specific servers , then , I 'm in favor of that .

dialogue type : s
C :  But se session management , I mean uh the authentication , if you go from one network to the other , it 's not solved .

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Nobody really wants a a guest on your network .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Unless you get some money through some way uh through some way .

dialogue type : s
C :  Then , there is also the session management in the sense that a lot of these things at the Barwan project , as you said , go through proxies .

dialogue type : s
C :  There might be kind of handoffs at uh at proxies ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  like the zip uh s zip proxy that we also discussed before a little bit .

dialogue type : s
C :  That that 's als I think also in the line of uh session management .

dialogue type : s
C :  Then there is this uh perfect thing uh the Berkeley sockets .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  It 's almost perfect .

dialogue type : s
C :  They s kind of skipped uh layer five , uh session management or session layer , I think .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  That 's um normally with if you do a socket programming , it 's directly the prot application protocol on layer four , uh TCP socket , or layer five for UDP socket .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Well ,

dialogue type : qy
C :  could you introduce such a session management ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Norm - what they do right now is they make it part of the application - level protocol .

dialogue type : s
C :  That 's what they do most often .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Like with session management ? for mobile the uh applications such as ist instant messaging or uh talks , and so on , uh like zip . It 's just doing a a reconnect .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  If they think that the network is different or different capabilities come into play , they simply do a reconnect

dialogue type : s
C :  so it 's part of the protocol .

dialogue type : s
C :  That 's all what I think about session management ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  like part of in proxies or is it en embedded in application level protocols ?

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  So how do you want to focus on network services .

dialogue type : %--
C :  Well the

dialogue type : s
C :  So " network applications " , if you look at the name of the group , one thing is that um the they used to call a a n a " network " that was uh if it was like distributed between two systems connected by a network .

dialogue type : s
C :  If you look at " network " from the OZ layer , then it 's uh , level two or something or maybe level three , but everything below three .

dialogue type : s
C :  So there are , I think , two two different interpretations of uh " network " .

dialogue type : qy
C :  But are there " network applications " , then ?

dialogue type : s
C :  So , the the name is " Network Services and Applications " ,

dialogue type : qw
C :  s so what could be an en example of a network application if you look at the OZ stick ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  OK , OK , well , they will I didn't want to get a discussion now .

dialogue type : s^aap
C :  Well , think it works ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  but uh

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C :  yes , the mapping of course between multicasting and the UMTS or or whatever

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  That 's or CDMA or whatever that 's uh , yeah , probably a thing that has to be find out .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't know what statuses .

dialogue type : s^am
C :  Maybe they already did it par as part of UMTS ,

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I 'm not sure .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't have a clue .

dialogue type : s
C :  I I only know how it works on copper and like ethernet

dialogue type : s
C :  and on PS PPP over something

dialogue type : s
C :  and how it works like that ,

dialogue type : s^no
C :  but on the wireless I 'm not sure .

dialogue type : s^aap|s.%--
C :  Yes , but if if it 's available

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  that means

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  so so if uh if it 's already part of the UMTS standardization then uh it 's immediately finished ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  like , OK , you can tell , KPN well go to Ericsson or Nokia and buy it ?

dialogue type : s
C :  And if it 's not in there yet well , it could be a suggestion

dialogue type : s
C :  and then the hardware people will make it part u like the ETSI or whatever where U wherever UMTS is standardized they will d well , go for it .

dialogue type : s
C :  Of course , yeah , this this group could do that , too .

dialogue type : s
C :  Could be ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  but

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I 'm not really sure ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but I thought I I had the impression that we can throw away our Nokia stuff when our web gateways , when we g even go to GPRS ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so

dialogue type : s
C :  let alone UMTS .

dialogue type : s
C :  That 's the impression I get .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
C :  Yeah , definitely .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  But but still a le d it 's a it 's a fundamental

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  the terminal has a WAP stick .

dialogue type : s
C :  And there 's a box that has also a a WAP stick .

dialogue type : s
C :  And they do sometime most cases , they do share an IP address .

dialogue type : s
C :  But doesn't uh have to deal with IP at all .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's l just a thirty - bit number

dialogue type : s
C :  that a actually is an assigned number .

dialogue type : s
C :  But it 's all only used for identification .

dialogue type : s
C :  That 's the only thing .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's stored in a WAP cookie ,

dialogue type : s
C :  much like HTP

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  in a cookie and from the WAP gateway

dialogue type : s
C :  then it will be HTP real HTP or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  So it 's it 's really a different uh type of connection .

dialogue type : s
C :  It looks a little bit like uh the the well , WML looks a little bit like HTML ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's not IP at all .

dialogue type : s
C :  Because there is a gateway , you can access with almost the same microbrowser ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  the same i uh web servers .

dialogue type : s
C :  If they provide the right content uh , spit out the right uh WML language .

dialogue type : s
C :  So it 's it 's really a different network technology I think .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
C :  But @ @

dialogue type : %-
C :  I i

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  Ri - right now there is still a lot of WAP , actually .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Well , users usage .

dialogue type : s
C :  My colleagues are .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
C :  Yeah , they are using WAP .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
C :  i

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  Bu - well , you don't have a mobile phone in in the USA here .

dialogue type : s
C :  So that 's maybe the reason .

dialogue type : s
C :  And I 'm not I doubt that it 's not available in Germany .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's would be unbelievable to me .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  It i it is .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  In in in Sweden it is also there .

dialogue type : s^df^e
C :  And in the Netherlands , it is also available .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk|%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^fe
C :  Oh !

dialogue type : %-
C :  Bu

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I 'm the first one to admit that 's a h that it is a hype ,

dialogue type : s^df^rt
C :  but and but I 'm I just wanted to say it is being used .

dialogue type : s
C :  But if it makes sense to me and to especially to have WAP in in between , no .

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm not a supporter of it .

dialogue type : s
C :  So they have this optimized protocol to to transmit a few ASCII bytes that can rescr refresh the screen with a different animation every , well , second , a few times .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  So , that 's that 's true .

dialogue type : s
C :  I immediately agree .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  But the thing was , y you just asked well , " will will it be the same , will there be WAP for UMTS " and so on , QPRS .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  And well I don't have the answer ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but I thought it was not .

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm just It 's weird it 's weird to stop doing it with GPRS .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
C :  if you want to do it in a in a mobile phone want to implement it , as a light stack or something .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
C :  Yes ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
C :  No , not not if you have a big uh web pad or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  Then you m There there 's an IP stack in it

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : %-
C :  So

dialogue type : qy.%--
C :  c Can I do another one , like

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  UMTS or wireless u i generally are will be m more expensive .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And especially UMTS .

dialogue type : s
C :  If they want to get back the money .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  not really billing , of course .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  but at least the different application of protocol - based usage .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  So you have uh one connection , one application uses FTP whatever ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  That those type of application you m may might want to make more out of a megabit per second or something .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Could that be something ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  or ?

dialogue type : %-
C :  Or is n

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C :  e

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
C :  Yeah , that 's true .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
C :  Yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : %-
C :  N

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  Well , I 'm not sure .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  I I th I think I agree with him .

dialogue type : s
C :  But uh right now we 're looking at b a th You want to do a big thing instead of a great thing .

dialogue type : s
C :  So if you d assume that it should connect uh really good to Siemens and to uh KPN , and to the then it starts to get big we should all go to the in the same direction .

dialogue type : s
C :  If you already assume " well , OK , they paid money " , and now you think , OK , what what great thing you want to do , then it gives you more freedom to think about this great thing you want to m do .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  But you but you don't get one if you if you try to to align KPN with Siemens , for instance .

dialogue type : %-
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  That 's right now the s the status .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm out for th one a week and a half .

dialogue type : s
C :  So on Wednesday , Thursday , Friday , I have a workshop at Stanford

dialogue type : s
C :  and next week I have a week on holiday .

dialogue type : s^am
C :  Could be .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So so the only solution would for for KPN would be that there is a p a project in this area .

dialogue type : s
C :  So that makes sense to do in this ar This , I mean the Bay Area

dialogue type : s
C :  with a group of uh a few people ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  like four or something ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and that connects to this project .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , one somebody or two somebodies can be found uh founded or get money to join this project .

dialogue type : s
C :  But that the other four should build a service on top of it , that has a clear business focus .

dialogue type : s
C :  It means eh a a UMTS service basically .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^nd
C :  Yeah , but you see the the they ask something pretty strange .

dialogue type : s
C :  They they want something pretty strange from me that I think of a service ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  a network service .

dialogue type : s
C :  There are sixty million billion people in the in the world that think of services all day

dialogue type : s
C :  and try to make a lot of money with it in the form of start - ups or whatever .

dialogue type : s
C :  And just think of a service like that , if I could do this .

dialogue type : %-
C :  w

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C :  Bu

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , u until now I have been trying to think about it ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  but eh f to me u

dialogue type : s
C :  what I have every every time I encountered it , it is all this is all pretty close by ,

dialogue type : s
C :  like the industry is already behind this .

dialogue type : s
C :  So they they want to make this available pretty soon .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I 'm just trying to think uh m more ahead , like uh use the wireless device as a only as a signalling thing or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  So so whenever you come in with your uh GSM phone and there is a PC available , like everything will be directed to the the bigger device or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  So more services like that .

dialogue type : s
C :  I think the they are working pretty hard to get IP available very good and efficiently from uh two mobile devices or wireless devices .

dialogue type : %-
C :  a th thing

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  And there 's a We m

dialogue type : s
C :  Our group might fo want to focus on the uh IP over ether no nets

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  or something like

dialogue type : s^e
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  N no nets ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Like only over ether .

dialogue type : s
C :  carefully integrated for net

dialogue type : s
C :  but there is no net .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  If you want to do make like also for wireless devices end to end IP available , that could be a vision .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Like .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , so he he says well IP to IP or end to end IP , is far well , it 's far away .

dialogue type : fh
C :  um

dialogue type : s
C :  So you what you might want to do is well get U M T S out there

dialogue type : s
C :  and just do uh I Ps playing over radio .

dialogue type : s
C :  Like like SDH , IP over fiber or WDM - WDM .

dialogue type : s
C :  This gets rid of the SDH .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  Or , well , start with get rid of the ATM first

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  and then get rid of SDH .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
C :  Eh you guys do that discussion later on please ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  uh ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  RSVP .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Don't switch it off .
