dialogue type : s
D :  And we already got the crash out of the way .

dialogue type : s
D :  It did crash , so I feel much better , earlier .

dialogue type : fg
D :  OK , so um .

dialogue type : s^na^rt
D :  I did collect an agenda .

dialogue type : s
D :  So I 'm gonna go first .

dialogue type : s^fe
D :  Mwa - ha - ha !

dialogue type : s
D :  It shouldn't take too long .

dialogue type : s
D :  Um , so we 're pretty much out of digits .

dialogue type : s
D :  We 've gone once through the set .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Um , so the only thing I have to do

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : s
D :  so I I just have to go through them

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  and uh pick out the ones that have problems ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and either correct them or have them re - read .

dialogue type : s
D :  So we probably have like four or five more forms to be read , to be once through the set .

dialogue type : s
D :  I 've also extracted out about an hour 's worth .

dialogue type : s
D :  We have about two hours worth .

dialogue type : s
D :  I extracted out about an hour 's worth

dialogue type : s
D :  which are the f digits with for which whose speaker have speaker forms ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  have filled out speaker forms .

dialogue type : s
D :  Not everyone 's filled out a speaker form .

dialogue type : s
D :  So I extracted one for speakers who have speaker forms

dialogue type : s
D :  and for meetings in which the " key " file and the transcript files are parsable .

dialogue type : s
D :  Some of the early key files , it looks like , were done by hand ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and so they 're not automatically parsable

dialogue type : s
D :  and I have to go back and fix those .

dialogue type : s
D :  So what that means is we have about an hour of transcribed digits that we can play with .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep ,

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yes , absolutely .

dialogue type : s
D :  So it 's just a question of a little hand - editing of some files

dialogue type : s
D :  and then waiting for more people to turn in their speaker forms .

dialogue type : s
D :  I have this web - based speaker form ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I sent mail to everyone who hadn't filled out a speaker form ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and they 're slowly s trickling in .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's for labeling the extracted audio files .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  By speaker ID and microphone type .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  No , I spoke with Jane about that

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  We edit out any of the errors anyway . Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So the there are no errors in the digits ,

dialogue type : s
D :  you 'll always read the string correctly .

dialogue type : s
D :  So I can't imagine why anyone would care .

dialogue type : s^t^tc.%--
D :  So the other topic with digits is uh ,

dialogue type : s
D :  Liz would like to elicit different prosodics ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and so we tried last week with them written out in English .

dialogue type : s
D :  And it just didn't work at all

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because no one grouped them together .

dialogue type : s
D :  So it just sounded like many many more lines instead of anything else .

dialogue type : s
D :  So in conversations with Liz and uh Jane we decided that if you wrote them out as numbers instead of words it would elicit more phone number , social security number - like readings .

dialogue type : s
D :  The problem with that is it becomes numbers instead of digits .

dialogue type : s
D :  When I look at this , that first line is " sixty one , sixty two , eighteen , eighty six , ten . "

dialogue type : qh
D :  Um , and so the question is does anyone care ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Um , I 've already spoken with Liz and she feels that , correct me if I 'm wrong , that for her , connected numbers is fine ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  as opposed to connected digits .

dialogue type : s
D :  Um , I think two hours is probably fine for a test set ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but it may be a little short if we actually wanna do training and adaptation and all that other stuff .

dialogue type : fg|%-
D : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
D :  Six dash one , you mean ?

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^cs:s
D :  So we could just , uh , put in the instructions " read them as digits " .

dialogue type : qw
D :  How about " O " versus " zero " ?

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Just let them read it how they read it .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
D :  OK so so I can just add to the instructions to read it as digits

dialogue type : s
D :  not as connected numbers .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Oh yeah , absolutely ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  cognitively it 's much easier .

dialogue type : s^bk|qr
D :  OK . And is the spacing alright or do you think there should be more space between digits and groups ?

dialogue type : qrr
D :  Or is that alright ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I think there are about ten different gouping patterns

dialogue type : qy
D :  isn't that right , Liz ?

dialogue type : s^e
D :  That we did .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  I think that uh trying to duplicate , spending too much effort trying to duplicate the existing TI - digits probably isn't too worthwhile

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because the recording situation is so different .

dialogue type : s^df^e
D :  It 's gonna be very hard to be comparable .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah I mean read versus not .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Well , and not just that ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean the uh the corpus itself .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , we 're collecting it in a read digit in a particular list ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I 'm sure that they 're doing more specific stuff .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean if I remember correctly it was like postman reading zipcodes and things like that .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  I thought so .

dialogue type : qy
D :  Was it read ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  Oh , I may well be .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I haven't ever listened to TI - digits .

dialogue type : s
D :  So I don't really know how it compares .

dialogue type : s
D :  But but regardless it 's gonna it 's hard to compare cross - corpus .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s
D :  And which group appears is picked randomly , and what the numbers are are picked randomly .

dialogue type : s
D :  So unlike the previous one , which I d simply replicated TI - digits , this is generated randomly .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah all we have for some people is digits .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
D :  Oh , you 're not .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh I see .

dialogue type : s^a|s^na
D :  Oh yeah that 's true , absolutely .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  That would be interesting to see whether that helps .

dialogue type : qy.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa^j
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^j|s^j^na
D :  Yeah , I have a real problem with that .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  Same same acoustics ,

dialogue type : s
D :  same microphone ,

dialogue type : s
D :  same channel .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Good .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  Yeah , we talked about that a couple times .

dialogue type : s
D :  The the problem I see with trying to do overlapping digits is the cognitive load .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^bd^df
D :  No it 's it 's not stupid ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  it 's just I mean , try to do it .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , here , let 's try it .

dialogue type : s^co
D :  You read the last line , I 'll read the first line .

dialogue type : s^co^r
D :  So so you read the last line , I 'll read the first line .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  Oh I guess if you plug you 're ears you could do it ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  but then you don't get the the same effects .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh I see .

dialogue type : s^am^cs
D :  I guess we could try .

dialogue type : s^cs^e
D :  We could try doing some .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
D :  Well Well OK . Well let 's try it .

dialogue type : s^co
D :  You do the last line , I 'll do the first line .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  O . That 's not bad .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  The poor transcribers

dialogue type : s
D :  they 're gonna hate us .

dialogue type : s
D :  A round .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  I think maybe if we wanted to do that we would do it as a separate session ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  something like that

dialogue type : s^e
D :  rather than doing it during a real meeting

dialogue type : s
D :  and you know , do two people at a time

dialogue type : s^e
D :  then three people at a time and things like that .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s
D :  See see what Dan thinks .

dialogue type : s^aa^j
D :  Yeah , right .

dialogue type : s
D :  I thought this was gonna be fast .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Oh well .

dialogue type : s^j^nd
D :  Not after I " eight " though .

dialogue type : h
D :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
D :  Nein !

dialogue type : s^j
D :  You have to be German ,

dialogue type : b
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Oh !

dialogue type : s
D :  I think for something like that we 'd be better off doing like uh TIMIT .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt^t^tc
D :  OK , are we done with digits ?

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^t
D :  We have ASR results from Liz ,

dialogue type : s^t
D :  transcript status from Jane ,

dialogue type : s^t
D :  and disk space and storage formats from Don .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Does do we have any prefer preference on which way we wanna we wanna go ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qh
D :  Um , why don't you , if you have a hard copy , why don't you email it to the list .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  Oh it 's in the paper .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  OK then , it 's already been mailed .

dialogue type : qy^2^bu^d
D :  Horrible ?

dialogue type : s^2:s
D :  And someone said " oh " in the front in the middle .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  I noticed that Chuck was wearing the lapel a lot .

dialogue type : s^am
D :  Probably how you wear it wore it I would guess .

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  And he said , " Lots lots lots lots . "

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  Well that 's with the hand stuff .

dialogue type : qh^df
D :  But how would you do that automatically ?

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean that that 's the sort of thing that you would do .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I also wanted to say I have done all this chopping up of digits ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so I have some naming conventions that we should try to agree on .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So let 's do that off - line ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  we don't need to do it during the meeting .

dialogue type : s
D :  And and I have scripts that will extract it out from " key " files

dialogue type : s
D :  and and do all the naming automatically ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so you don't have to do it by hand .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Yeah , names names in the names to I Ds ,

dialogue type : %-
D :  so you

dialogue type : s
D :  and it does all sorts of matches

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because the way people filled out names is different on every single file

dialogue type : s
D :  so it does a very fuzzy sort of match .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  So th I now have a script that you can just say basically look up Morgan ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and it will give you his ID .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
D :  alright .

dialogue type : qy.%--
D : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt^t^tc
D :  Don , you had disk space and storage formats .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Is that something we need to talk about at the meeting ,

dialogue type : qrr
D :  or should you just talk with Chuck at some other time ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  Entropy coding .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  And I assume half of it is scratch and half of it is ?

dialogue type : s^am|s^bk
D :  Probably , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bd
D :  That doesn't matter .

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Slash N slash machine name , slash X A in all likelihood .

dialogue type : fg|qh.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  The distinction between scratch and non - scratch is whether it 's backed up or not .

dialogue type : s
D :  So what you wanna do is use the scratch for stuff that you can regenerate .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So ,

dialogue type : s
D :  the stuff that isn't backed up is not a big deal

dialogue type : s
D :  because disks don't crash very frequently ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  as long as you can regenerate it .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Then put it all on scratch

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because we 're ICSI is is bottlenecked by backup .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  It just depends on your tools .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I mean , because it 's not backed up and it 's just on scratch , if your sc tools can't take shortened format , I would leave them expanded ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so you don't have to unshorten them every single time you wanna do anything .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
D :  Yeah , as I said , since that 's it 's regeneratable , what I would do is take downsample it ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
D :  and compress it however you 're e the SRI recognizer wants to take it in .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
D :  And that 's the whole point about the naming conventions

dialogue type : s
D :  is that you could run all the English speaking ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  all the native speakers ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and all the non - native speakers ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and all the men , and all the women .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j^m
D :  " That 's just not right , man . "

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : qh^df
D :  So so s For example , what if you wanted to run run all the native speakers .

dialogue type : s^f|s
D :  Right , so if if you did it that way you would have to generate a program that looks in the database somewhere ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  extracts out the language ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  finds the time - marks for that particular one ,

dialogue type : s
D :  do it that way .

dialogue type : s
D :  The way they 're doing it , you have that already extracted

dialogue type : s
D :  and it 's embedded in the file name .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s:s
D :  y so you just say you know " asterisk E asterisk dot wave " , and you get what you want .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Rather than doing seeks through the file .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  This is all just temporary access ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  It 's fine .

dialogue type : s^f
D :  You know .

dialogue type : s
D :  Fine to do it however is convenient .

dialogue type : s^aa^t3|s^t3
D :  Yeah and they don't .

dialogue type : s^rt^t3
D :  Two gig ?

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  Yes you can .

dialogue type : %-
D :  I th

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  w The transcribers didn't have any problem with that

dialogue type : qy
D :  did they Jane ?

dialogue type : s
D :  They loaded they loaded the long long files into X Waves .

dialogue type : qr
D :  Are you talking about Transcriber or X Waves ?

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because because i we used X Waves to do the digits .

dialogue type : s
D :  And they were loading the full mixed files then ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and it didn't seem to be any problem .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba^nd
D :  Seemed really fast .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
D :  and , it 's no problem , right ?

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because it 's not backed up .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  If we don't have a spare disk sitting around we go out and we buy ourselves an eighty gigabyte drive

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and make it all scratch space .

dialogue type : s
D :  You know , it 's not a big deal .

dialogue type : s^co^t^tc
D :  So remind me afterward

dialogue type : s
D :  and I 'll and we 'll look at your disk and see where to put stuff .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Each partition .

dialogue type : s
D :  And you wanna use , either XA or scratch .

dialogue type : s^bsc
D :  Well X question mark ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  anything starting with X is scratch .

dialogue type : s^m|s^aa
D :  Two digits , right ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  XA , XB , XC .

dialogue type : qy^f^rt
D :  OK ?

dialogue type : qo^rt^t^tc
D :  Jane ?

dialogue type : s^j.%--
D : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  And then you gloss them ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  And so so your list here , are these ones that actually occurred in the meetings ?

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
D :  Whew !

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  We are acronym - loaded .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  Except right there .

dialogue type : %-
D :  Well ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but they have the gloss .

dialogue type : s^r
D :  You have the gloss form

dialogue type : s^e
D :  so you always replace it .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  If that 's how what you wanna do .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : %-
D :  Can ca

dialogue type : fg|qy
D :  So a are we done with acronyms ?

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Cuz I had a question on what what this meant .

dialogue type : s^fa
D :  Oh I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : s
D :  A comment , basically .

dialogue type : s
D :  They 're impulsive .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well the " QUAL " can be The " QUAL " is applying to the left .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  " While laughing " .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Oh good .

dialogue type : s
D :  So it 's a small list .

dialogue type : s^bu^j^rt
D :  That that 's known as " found data " .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba
D :  Yeah . It 's much easier .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^fe
D :  Ah !

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Yes , that 's right .

dialogue type : s
D :  We 're gonna have a big problem when we talk about that .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  In Monty Python you say " argh " a lot .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , or if you 're a C programmer .

dialogue type : s^e:s
D :  You say arg - C and arg - V all the time .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  It does .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
D :  Ah !

dialogue type : s^j
D :  Maybe he died while dictating .

dialogue type : s^rt:s^rt
D :  Eh ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
D :  You mean just the single letter " a " as in the particle ?

dialogue type : s^bsc
D :  Article .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  I 'm just these poor transcribers , they 're gonna hate this meeting .

dialogue type : s
D :  Them Canadians .

dialogue type : b
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh I see .

dialogue type : s
D :  I didn't get that ,

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Yeah , it 's good ,

dialogue type : b
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
D :  And just listen to them ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Performance art ,

dialogue type : s^cs^na
D :  just extract them all .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh I see .

dialogue type : %-
D :  o

dialogue type : qw
D :  How about question mark ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : s:qy^bu^d^rt
D :  So they so it 's " PLP ? "

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  That 's a good one .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  That 's correct .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  I know !

dialogue type : s
D :  I I was saying that I think a lot of them are the Networks meeting .

dialogue type : s
D :  I see a few .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Although I see I see plenty of uh

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Yeah , that 's pretty close .

dialogue type : s
D :  Count .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  Yeah , I wonder what it is .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  Oh I 'm sure we 've said XML more than five times .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba
D :  Yes , it 's very bad .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Yeah that 's right .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
D :  And that 's an underestimate

dialogue type : s^df.%-
D :  cuz they 're

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , we 'll have to look at it you know .

dialogue type : s^tc
D :  So I 'll just I was just looking at the bottom of page three there ,

dialogue type : qr^j
D :  is that " to be " or " not to be " .

dialogue type : fg|s^fa
D :  OK anyways , sorry .

dialogue type : s^t^t1
D :  " Try to stay on topic , Adam . "

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
D :  OK so , um , on some of these QUALs ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  are they really QUALs ,

dialogue type : qrr
D :  or are they glosses ?

dialogue type : s^e^rt:s^rt
D :  So like there 's a " QUAL TCL " .

dialogue type : h
D :  Uh

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh I see , I see .

dialogue type : s
D :  So it 's not gloss .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK , I see .

dialogue type : s
D :  It wasn't said " TCL " .

dialogue type : s
D :  Of course .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  We 'll probably add it to the language model .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  What did I say ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Well both .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  We can go on lan lan add it to both dictionary and language model .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  Well " tickle " was pronounced " tickle " .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df^e
D :  It 's pronounced the same it 's pronounced the same as the verb .

dialogue type : s
D :  So I think it 's the language model that makes it different .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh I see .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  And and you 'll ha you 'll have to do it sychronously .

dialogue type : s^f|s
D :  Right , so y so , whoever 's creating the new models , will have to also go through the transcripts and change them synchronously .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  You can correct it .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
