dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yeah , that 's true .

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
F :  I 've noticed that . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Which makes sense .

dialogue type : s
F :  Oh , on the email .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Well , and then the other possibility was e that we provide them with a a file that already has the beeps in it or something .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Wasn't that what you said ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
F :  Oh !

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

F :  Well you th

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  So just r r truly chron chromatically up all the way through the entire meeting .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Interesting .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  It 'd be impossible to r to misorder them .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's pretty simple ,

dialogue type : s^r
F :  pretty simple .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Hmm , interesting .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Well . Well ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  " high " , " low " is pretty straightforward ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
F :  You 'd have to they 'd have to have the acoustics of dogs t hear into the high high ranges .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba^cs
F :  It 's a shame we can't really give a number .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  So it would be a number and a beep .

dialogue type : %--
F :  e

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  It 's a shame we can't do that .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  That 'll work .

dialogue type : s^ba|s^ba
F :  Wow , that 'd also be shorter to type .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Interesting .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , that 's true .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Or maybe could it be a click and the number .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Or a beep and the number , and then and then you just do the the num th you do it as a d a digit .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F :  Well , if if it saves time ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  It might actually help them in terms of their place holding .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  And it might be helpful to them in terms of d act

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  Well , no no no no .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : %--
F :  I i

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  We could actually build the numbers into a template .

dialogue type : %--
F :  Well .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's a good idea .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Very simple .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's forty - five minutes .

dialogue type : s^r
F :  Forty - five minutes for that one .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's possible .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah . That 's right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yeah , it was forty - five minutes .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Hmm , interesting .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , with just one digit though ,

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : fg|s.%-

F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  I think it would save them time .

dialogue type : s
F :  I think it would help them keep the track track of it .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Interesting ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , someone 's gonna talk to Brian .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  I also looked thr over the text

dialogue type : s
F :  and I was impressed by the accuracy ,

dialogue type : s^ba^e
F :  it looks really good .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yeah , it 's there .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^bd
F :  Oh . Yes . But this is not important .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's systematic ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  And and Brian actually forwarded me in advance .

dialogue type : s
F :  He he wor he very nicely worked out a set of conventions which is intermediate between ours and the ones that they 're used to .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Which is which is really a good a good way to do it .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  No problem .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs
F :  Yeah . We can do it this week .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  I actually really like them though .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yeah , I do .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  The other thing , too , is th y you said that the acoustic pra q quality of the one that you 're wearing , the fancy one , is actually somewhat better than

dialogue type : s^no
F :  So I I don't know if it 's a noticeable difference ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , I p I personally really prefer that model ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so I think you know we 've got this problem of people having different different preferences .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  It 's I I understand ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  that 's fine with me .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I I g would say that um , I find this model easier to adjust ,

dialogue type : s
F :  that 's one of the reasons I don't like these ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz I keep m you know , bending it ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : qh^d^rt
F :  You do ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Huh .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  Then they have to be rewired though ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  don't they ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Specially .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  You you put it over the corner of your ear .

dialogue type : s
F :  I can't I 'm having competing microphone headphone problems here .

dialogue type : s
F :  This one .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  It 's an interesting idea .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  the acoustics on this are really s m better than when I talk into it directly .

dialogue type : s
F :  Works with this .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
F :  I had another thought .

dialogue type : qh^cs.%--
F :  Would w would it be possi

dialogue type : s
F :  There are scripts that uh , run ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  and and when it 's finished compressing , would it be possible for the script to change the permissions on the file to be more strict ?

dialogue type : s^e.%-
F : 

dialogue type : qy^df^rt
F :  But after the meeting 's done , would they want to ?

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's true .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yeah , that 's true .

dialogue type : s
F :  Also it seems like once it 's been stored that night , it 's it 's possible to recover from backups ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so that the main risk is avoiding it being accidentally deleted during the day that it was recorded .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  And I 'd prefer it to go through me .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %
F :  w w

dialogue type : %-
F :  Well

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  uh , uh , My my view on this is that once it 's in a final version and I 'm working toward all these being final versions , then it can go into this next ro this next realm .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  But it it 's sort of counter - productive to have changes made which I would be making if I 'd just gotten that far in the file .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  You know , it 's it 's , um .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  And then after that , then this would probably work .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Good , good .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  ke " key " file 's different .

dialogue type : %-
F :  " Key " fi

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , " key " file has the extra attributes that if you notice that there are lots of spikes on channel

dialogue type : s
F :  so - and - so , it 's useful as a repository for putting that there .

dialogue type : s
F :  And also if you notice that there was an extra speaker ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and didn't get mentioned in the " key " file ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but they were only there for a second ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but it 's t useful to mention that they were there .

dialogue type : s
F :  So I th I think that the " key " file is usefu for notations related to the meeting ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but it 's different from the transcript .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's interesting .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  I also think , um , that the type of change ch ch varies an I think it 's a very good point .

dialogue type : qh^df
F :  Because what if the uh , what if one set of changes one person was making was with reference to some typographical convention .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  And the other person n unkn n quite unknowingly , was changing it the other way around .

dialogue type : s
F :  Then you could end up with a real mess ,

dialogue type : s
F :  in terms of , like , consistency of conventions across a file , there is an argument to be made for having a single editor editing at that level .

dialogue type : s^ba.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s
F :  And I also like I l also like Liz 's uh , k um , phraseology of " at this level of " I don't remember how you put it , but this " at this level of transcription " or whatever .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean it 's like there are different layers of whatever

dialogue type : s
F :  and different types of conventions ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and if it were an acronym , then I would I think that it would make sense f for them to have input into that level of things ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
F :  Well ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  I agree .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , I see now , we 're k back into the same situation as when we were , uh , talking about a allowing people to edit the transcripts before they become public .

dialogue type : s
F :  So there 's a question of how easy or how hard to modify ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and how that impacts the amount of changing that 's done .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  And I I think that it 's , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I I have received some suggestions for change , which I 've made .

dialogue type : s
F :  And um , I think with an acronym , that 's a clear case where it would be an easy change to incorporate .

dialogue type : s
F :  But it would worry me to have people , um , having free reign to change these things , because of the need to have consistent conventions .

dialogue type : s
F :  And people who are only just visiting the data might not have a sense of the larger system .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  I agr I agree but I have to also add one other thing which i before I forget it ,

dialogue type : s
F :  which is Adam 's point about when you were reviewing the IBM transcripts .

dialogue type : s
F :  u This was mentioned at the beginning of the meeting .

dialogue type : s
F :  You said that there were some places where it wasn't what y was written already , but you could see how they might have thought that 's what it said .

dialogue type : s
F :  So there it 's not just a right and wrong thing .

dialogue type : s
F :  Sometimes there tru there are absolutely stretches where there is no no k if you were at the meeting and you could ask the person ,

dialogue type : s
F :  maybe , m you know , they could they could 've told you ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but five minutes later they might not have been able to tell you ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  even if they were listening to it .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , sometimes it isn't right and wrong ,

dialogue type : s
F :  sometimes it 's multiple interpretations ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Now But of course , this does raise the possibility of allowing , um , an extra annotation for , you know , alternative interpretations of a stretch .

dialogue type : s
F :  But I just wanted to say it isn't simply right or wrong .

dialogue type : s
F :  Or overlooked or not overlooked .

dialogue type : s
F :  Sometimes they 're truly ambiguous ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  and um , uh , um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  nice to have a notation for that ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  And als it also

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^fe
F :  Ooo !
