dialogue type : s^cs
H :  Please give me one .

dialogue type : s
H :  It 's worse .

dialogue type : h|s
H :  Well , I only say that the this is , a summary of the of all the VTS experiments

dialogue type : s
H :  and say that the result in the last um , for Italian the last experiment for Italian , are bad .

dialogue type : s
H :  I make a mistake when I write .

dialogue type : s
H :  Up at D I copy one of the bad result .

dialogue type : fh
H : 

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  There . You know , this .

dialogue type : fh
H :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
H :  well .

dialogue type : s
H :  If we put everything , we improve a lot u the spectral use of the VTS

dialogue type : s
H :  but the final result are not still mmm , good like the Wiener filter for example .

dialogue type : s^no
H :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
H :  Maybe it 's @ @ it 's possible to to have the same result .

dialogue type : s^no
H :  I don't know exactly .

dialogue type : fh
H :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
H :  Because I have , mmm , worse result in medium mismatch and high mismatch .

dialogue type : fh
H :  And Yeah .

dialogue type : s
H :  I someti are more or less similar but but are worse .

dialogue type : fh
H :  And

dialogue type : s^rt
H :  still I don't have the result for TI - digits .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  The program is training .

dialogue type : s^am
H :  Maybe for this weekend I will have result TI - digits

dialogue type : s
H :  and I can complete that s like this .

dialogue type : fh
H :  Well .

dialogue type : s
H :  One thing that I note are not here in this result but are speak are spoken before with Sunil I I improve my result using clean LDA filter .

dialogue type : s
H :  If I use , eh , the LDA filter that are training with the noisy speech , that hurts the res my results .

dialogue type : s
H :  This is with the clean .

dialogue type : s
H :  With the noise I have worse result , that if I doesn't use it .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  But m that may be because with this technique we are using really really clean speech .

dialogue type : s
H :  The speech the representation that go to the HTK is really clean speech

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because it 's from the dictionary ,

dialogue type : s^e
H :  the code book

dialogue type : s^am
H :  and maybe from that .

dialogue type : s^no
H :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
H :  Because I think that you did some experiments using the two the two LDA filter , clean and noi and noise ,

dialogue type : s
H :  and it doesn't matter too much .

dialogue type : s^bu
H :  It 's better to use clean .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  Maybe you can do d also this .

dialogue type : s^e
H :  To use clean speech .

dialogue type : s
H :  Yeah , with the clean LDA .

dialogue type : qy
H :  Is that the reason ?

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  And this is everything .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
H :  And prepare at the s

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
H :  I was thinking to do that next week .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^cc
H :  I wi I I will do that next week .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  I can send

dialogue type : s
H :  yet .

dialogue type : z
H :  This is date and time .

dialogue type : z
H :  No .

dialogue type : z
H :  On the channel , channel .
