dialogue type : h|s^am
F :  Uh . I think we use a pre - emphasis .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s^bk
F :  Uh , yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , at first I had a remark

dialogue type : s
F :  why I am wondering why the PDA is always so far .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean we are always meeting at the beginning of the table and the PDA 's there .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Well , anyway .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : fg|%--
F :  Yeah , so .

dialogue type : h|s^rt
F :  Uh . Since the last meeting we 've we 've tried to put together um the clean low - pass um downsampling , upsampling , I mean ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  Uh the new filter that 's replacing the LDA filters ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and also the um delay issue

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  We considered th the the delay issue on the for the on - line normalization .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  So we 've put together all this

dialogue type : sj^ba^rt
F :  and then we have results that are not um very impressive .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , there is no real improvement .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  Well . Actually it 's better .

dialogue type : s
F :  It seems better when we look at the mismatched case

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  but I think we are like like cheated here by the th this problem

dialogue type : s
F :  that uh in some cases when you modify slight slightly modify the initial condition you end up completely somewhere air somewhere else in the in the space , the parameters .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  Well . The other system are for instance .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  For Italian is at seventy - eight percent recognition rate on the mismatch ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and this new system has eighty - nine .

dialogue type : s
F :  But I don't think it indicates something , really .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  I don't I don't think it means that the new system is more robust

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : %-
F :  Well .

dialogue type : %--
F :  Y

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's similar for other test sets

dialogue type : s
F :  but I mean from this se seventy - eight um percent recognition rate system , I could change the transition probabilities for the the first HMM and it will end up to eighty - nine also .

dialogue type : s
F :  By using point five instead of point six , point four as in the the HTK script .

dialogue type : fh|%--
F : 

dialogue type : %-
F :  Well .

dialogue type : fh.%
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa^m
F :  This really happens .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  Even tenth of a percent ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , we tried we tried point one ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm , yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^aap^df
F :  Yeah , but even if you use point five , I 'm not sure it will always give you the better results

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  on other test set or it

dialogue type : s
F :  on the other training set , I mean .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  But . I think ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  I think the reason is ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  it was in my mail I think also , is the fact that the mismatch is trained only on the far microphone .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , in for the mismatched case everything is um using the far microphone training and testing ,

dialogue type : s
F :  whereas for the highly mismatched , training is done on the close microphone

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  so it 's it 's clean speech basically

dialogue type : s
F :  so you don't have this problem of local minima probably

dialogue type : s
F :  and for the well - match , it 's a mix of close microphone and distant microphone

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Well .

dialogue type : s
F :  So th I think the mismatch is the more difficult for the training part .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fg.%
F :  Um .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  But actually um actually it seems to do a little bit worse for the well - matched case

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  Yeah , actually the way the final score is computed is quite funny .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  It 's not a mean of word error rate .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's not a weighted mean of word error rate ,

dialogue type : s
F :  it 's a weighted mean of improvements .

dialogue type : %--
F :  So .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Well I well what what What happened is that if you have a small improvement or a small if on the well - matched case it will have uh huge influence on the improvement compared to the reference

dialogue type : s
F :  because the reference system is is is quite good for for the well - ma well - matched case also .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
F :  No , but it 's the weighting of the of the improvement

dialogue type : s
F :  not of the error rate .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^aap^rt
F :  Yeah but what I mean is that you can have a huge improvement on the H HMK 's ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  uh like five percent uh absolute ,

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s^df^rt
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^m.%--
F :  Uh improvement ?

dialogue type : s^ar|s
F :  No , it 's compared to the word er it 's improvement on the word error rate ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^fa
F :  Sorry .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^arp^df
F :  Sure , but when we think about the weighting , which is point five , point three , point two , it 's on absolute on on relative figures ,

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
F :  So when we look at this error rate

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm , yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm , yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Well anyway

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
F :  Yeah . So it hurts a little bit on the well - match

dialogue type : fh
F :  and

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  Like , it 's difficult to say

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  because again

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
F :  um I 'm not sure I have the

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^tc
F :  So it 's around , like , point five .

dialogue type : s^rt
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk^m
F :  Worse , yep .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  Uh well we start from ninety - four point sixty - four ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and we go to ninety - four point O four .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^rt
F :  Oh , no , I 've ninety - four .

dialogue type : s
F :  Oh , the baseline , you mean .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well I don't I 'm not talking about the baseline here .

dialogue type : %--
F :  I

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  My baseline is the submitted system .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  For Finnish , we start to ninety - three point eight - four

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and we go to ninety - three point seventy - four .

dialogue type : s
F :  And for Spanish we are we were at ninety - five point O five

dialogue type : s
F :  and we go to ninety - three - s point sixty one .

dialogue type : %-
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  I guess I guess it 's it 's the filter .

dialogue type : s^df^rt
F :  Because nnn , well uh we don't have complete result ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  but the filter So the filter with the shorter delay hurts on Italian well - matched ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : %--
F :  And ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  And the other things , like um downsampling , upsampling , don't seem to hurt

dialogue type : s
F :  and the new on - line normalization , neither .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|%--
F :  Yeah that 's th

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  I think we can be completely fooled by this thing ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bd^no
F :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  So . There is first this thing ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
F :  yeah , I computed the um like , the confidence level on the different test sets .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  And for the well - matched they are around um point six uh percent .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  For the mismatched they are around like let 's say one point five percent .

dialogue type : s
F :  And for the well - m uh HM they are also around one point five .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
F :  But .

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh . About the same .

dialogue type : s
F :  It doesn't hurt .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , we are exchanging mail as soon as we we have significant results .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  For the moment , they are working on integrating the um spectral subtraction apparently from Ericsson .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
F :  And so .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  We are working on our side on other things like uh also trying a sup spectral subtraction

dialogue type : s
F :  but of of our own , I mean , another spectral substraction .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  So I think it 's it 's OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  uh everybody 's quite

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  There is this Eurospeech deadline ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um . And .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  But yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  As soon as we have something that 's significant and that 's better than than what was submitted ,

dialogue type : s
F :  we will fix fix the system

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  But we 've not discussed it it it this yet ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
F :  S

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na^rt
F :  Yeah we are We are trying to to do something with the Meeting Recorder digits ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  But yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  And the good thing is that there is this first deadline ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and , well , some people from OGI are working on a paper for this ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  but there is also the um special session about th Aurora

dialogue type : s
F :  which is uh which has an extended deadline .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  The deadline is in May .

dialogue type : %-
F :  For th

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  So f only for the experiments on Aurora .

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  So it it 's good ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's in Denmark .

dialogue type : qw^br
F :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s
F :  I think it 's the thirteenth of May .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  So it would be for the first deadline .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Nnn .

dialogue type : fg|s^bk^tc
F :  Uh , yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  I brought some I don't know if some figures here .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well . I start we started to work on spectral subtraction .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  And um the preliminary results were very bad .

dialogue type : s
F :  So the thing that we did is just to add spectral subtraction before this , the Wall uh process , which contains LDA on - line normalization .

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  And it hurts uh a lot .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  And so we started to look at at um things like this ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  which is ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  So you have the C - zero parameters for one uh Italian utterance .

dialogue type : s
F :  And I plotted this for two channels .

dialogue type : s
F :  Channel zero is the close mic microphone ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and channel one is the distant microphone .

dialogue type : s
F :  And it 's perfectly synchronized ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so .

dialogue type : s
F :  And the sentence contain only one word , which is " Due "

dialogue type : s
F :  And it can't clearly be seen .

dialogue type : qw
F :  Where where is it ?

dialogue type : qw
F :  Where is the word ?

dialogue type : %-
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  This is a plot of C - zero , uh when we don't use spectral substraction ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and when there is no on - line normalization .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  There is just some filtering with the LDA

dialogue type : s
F :  and and some downsampling , upsampling .

dialogue type : %-
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  So C - zero is very clean , actually .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  Uh then when we apply mean normalization it looks like the second figure ,

dialogue type : s
F :  though it is not .

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  Which is good .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , the noise part is around zero

dialogue type : s
F :  and And then the third figure is what happens when we apply mean normalization and variance normalization .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  What we can clearly see is that on the speech portion the two channel come becomes very close ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yeah . This is still C - zero .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa.%
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  It normalized th the standard deviation .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  You you get an estimate of the standard deviation .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  That 's

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : %-
F :  Yeah but .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah . Sure .

dialogue type : s^am
F :  If they are good .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  Well what it it shows is that , yeah , perhaps a good voice activity detector is is good before on - line normalization

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and that 's what uh we 've already observed .

dialogue type : %--
F :  But uh ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  voice activity detection is not an easy thing neither .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  So . What I notice is that , while I prefer to look at the second figure than at the third one ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  well , because you clearly see where speech is .

dialogue type : s
F :  But the problem is that on the speech portion , channel zero and channel one are more different than when you use variance normalization where channel zero and channel one become closer .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj.%--
F :  So I think ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  For I th I think that it perhaps it shows that uh the parameters that the voice activity detector should use uh have to use should be different than the parameter that have to be used for speech recognition .

dialogue type : %-
F :  Well , y

dialogue type : s^aap|s^arp
F :  Yeah , but it 's not clear ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : %--
F :  We

dialogue type : fg
F :  So .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  Well . It 's just to

dialogue type : s
F :  the the number that at that are here are recognition experiments on Italian HM and MM with these two kinds of parameters .

dialogue type : s
F :  And , well , it 's better with variance normalization .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s
F :  But the fact is that the voice activity detector doesn't work on channel one .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw^br
F :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's applied before variance normalization .

dialogue type : s
F :  So it 's a good thing ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because I guess voice activity detection on this should could be worse .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  It 's applied the

dialogue type : fh|%--
F :  um on ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  something like this ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^am
F :  Perhaps , yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So we could perhaps do just mean normalization before VAD .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw^br^d^m^rt
F :  About ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  Spectral subtraction ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  They are trying to u to use the um the Ericsson

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and we 're trying to use something something else .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
F :  Yeah , and also to understand what happens because

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh fff

dialogue type : s
F :  Well . When we do spectral subtraction , actually , I think that this is the the two last figures .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Um . It seems that after spectral subtraction , speech is more emerging now uh than than before .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , the difference between the energy of the speech and the energy of the n spectral subtrac subtracted noise portion is is larger .

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Actually the scale is not the same ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but if you look at the the numbers um you clearly see that the difference between the C - zero of the speech and C - zero of the noise portion is larger .

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh but what happens is that after spectral subtraction , you also increase the variance of this of C - zero .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so if you apply variance normalization on this , it completely sc screw everything .

dialogue type : %--
F :  Well .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um . Uh . Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  And what they did at OGI is just uh they don't use on - line normalization , for the moment , on spectral subtraction

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  I think as soon as they will try on - line normalization there will be a problem .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So yeah , we 're working on the same thing but I think

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  with different different system

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|%--
F :  Yeah , well ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^aa^rt|s.%--
F :  Yeah . But I think they '

dialogue type : s^df^rt
F :  I think we want to work on this .

dialogue type : s^df^rt
F :  They also want to work on this ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh . yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  We we will try MSG ,

dialogue type : %--
F :  but um ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  And they are t

dialogue type : s
F :  I think they want to work on the second stream also ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but more with some kind of multi - band

dialogue type : s
F :  or , well , what they call TRAP or generalized TRAP .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um . So .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  It 's uh in June .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  Yeah but I don't know which VAD they use .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
F :  Uh . If the use the small VAD

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I think it 's easy to do better

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because it doesn't work at all .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I I don't know which which one .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's Pratibha that that did this experiment .

dialogue type : s
F :  Um . We should ask which VAD she used .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah but I it 's uh I think you were talking about the other mail that used VAD on the reference features .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , so we should find out if it 's really better .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  the compared to the small or the big network .

dialogue type : s
F :  And perhaps we can easily improve if if we put like mean normalization before the before the VAD .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  Because as as you 've mentioned .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , my feeling is that um actually when we look at all the proposals , ev everybody is still using some kind of spectral envelope

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah , well , not pitch ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but to look at the um fine at the at the high re high resolution spectrum .

dialogue type : s
F :  So . We don't necessarily want to find the the pitch of the of the sound

dialogue type : %--
F :  but

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  Cuz I have a feeling that when we look when we look at the just at the envelope there is no way you can tell if it 's voiced and unvoiced ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's it 's easy in clean speech because voiced sound are more low frequency

dialogue type : fh
F :  and .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So there would be more ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  uh there is the first formant , which is the larger

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and then voiced sound are more high frequencies

dialogue type : s
F :  cuz it 's frication

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : %--
F :  But ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  When you have noise there is no

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  um if if you have a low frequency noise it could be taken for for voiced speech

dialogue type : fh
F :  and .

dialogue type : fg
F :  So .

dialogue type : %-
F :  S

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^co
F :  well , go go on .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : %-
F :  So .

dialogue type : h|s^cs.%--
F :  Um yeah , so yeah , I think if we try to develop a second stream

dialogue type : s
F :  well , there would be one stream that is the envelope and the second , it could be interesting to have

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  that 's something that 's more related to the fine structure of the spectrum .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And .

dialogue type : fh|s^no
F :  Yeah , so I don't know .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  We were thinking about like using ideas from from Larry Saul ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
F :  have a good voice detector ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
F :  have a good ,

dialogue type : fh|s^cs^rt
F :  well , voiced - speech detector , that 's working on on the FFT

dialogue type : fh
F :  and uh

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
F :  Larry Saul could be an idea .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
F :  We were are thinking about just kind of uh taking the spectrum

dialogue type : s
F :  and computing the variance of of the high resolution spectrum and things like this .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  They didn't .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
F :  yeah , this could be an

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  So you mean have some kind of probability for the v the voicing

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and then use a tandem system

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  I see , yeah . Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  Because , yeah , well , spectral subtraction is good

dialogue type : s
F :  and we could u we could use the fine structure to to have a better estimate of the noise

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  but still there is this issue with spectral subtraction that it seems to increase the variance of of of

dialogue type : fh
F :  um

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  Well it 's this musical noise which is annoying if you d you do some kind of on - line normalization after .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|sj^ba
F :  Well . Spectral subtraction and on - line normalization don't seem to to go together very well .

dialogue type : %-
F :  I

dialogue type : b
F :  Ah , yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %--
F :  It it i

dialogue type : s^bk^m
F :  has not ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Was it nois noisy condition ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  the example that you you just

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  But we were thinking , we discussed with Barry about this ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and perhaps thinking we were thinking about some kind of sheet cheating experiment where we would use TIMIT

dialogue type : s
F :  and see if giving the d uh , this voicing bit would help in in terms of uh frame classification .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah , but but B but we cannot do the cheating , this cheating thing .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , for Italian perhaps we have ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but we don't have this labeling for Aurora .

dialogue type : s
F :  We just have a labeling with word models

dialogue type : s
F :  but not for phonemes .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  noise , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah , that 's right , yep .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba^rt
F :  Well , I guess I guess we can we can say that it will help ,

dialogue type : s^bd^no
F :  but I don't know .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  If this voicing bit doesn't help , uh , I think we don't have to to work more about this

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh . It 's just to know if it how much i it will help

dialogue type : s
F :  and to have an idea of how much we can gain .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw^d^rt
F :  And the all the the SpeechCorders ?

dialogue type : qw^rt.%--
F :  what 's the idea behind ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  Oh , they don't even have to detect voiced spe speech ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  They just work on the code book

dialogue type : s
F :  and find out the best excitation .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Alright .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  So it would not help .
