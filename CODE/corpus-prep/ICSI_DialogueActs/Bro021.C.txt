dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Alright .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  Well , the first thing maybe is that the p Eurospeech paper is , uh , accepted .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  So it 's the paper that describe basically the , um , system that were proposed for the Aurora .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right , yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  So and the , fff comments seems from the reviewer are good .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  It 's , uh , Aalborg in Denmark .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And it 's ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  September .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  Then , uh , whhh

dialogue type : s
C :  well , I 've been working on on t mainly on on - line normalization this week .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh , I 've been trying different slightly slightly different approaches .

dialogue type : fh|s^e^rt
C :  Um , the first thing is trying to play a little bit again with the , um , time constant .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Uh , second thing is , uh , the training of , uh , on - line normalization with two different means ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  one mean for the silence and one for the speech .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and so I have two recursions which are controlled by the , um , probability of the voice activity detector .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  This actually don't s doesn't seem to help ,

dialogue type : s
C :  although it doesn't hurt .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : s
C :  But well , both on - line normalization approach seems equivalent .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  They can be very different .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah . Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I didn't look , uh , more closely .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Um . It might be , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , eh , there is one thing that we can observe , is that the mean are more different for for C - zero and C - one than for the other coefficients .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  There are strange strange thing happening with C - one , is that when you have different kind of noises , the mean for the the silence portion is can be different .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  So when you look at the trajectory of C - one , it 's has a strange shape

dialogue type : fh
C :  and

dialogue type : s
C :  I was expecting th the s that these two mean helps ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  especially because of the the strange C - ze C - one shape ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
C :  uh , which can like , yo you can have , um , a trajectory for the speech

dialogue type : s^e^rt
C :  and then when you are in the silence it goes somewhere ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  but if the noise is different it goes somewhere else .

dialogue type : s
C :  So which would mean that if we estimate the mean based on all the signal , even though we have frame dropping , but we don't frame ev uh , drop everything ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but uh , this can hurts the estimation of the mean for speech ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  Mmm . But I still have to investigate further , I think .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
C :  Um , a third thing is , um , that instead of t having a fixed time constant , I try to have a time constant that 's smaller at the beginning of the utterances

dialogue type : s^e
C :  to adapt more quickly to the r something that 's closer to the right mean .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then this time constant increases

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  well , if it 's higher than a certain threshold , I keep it to this threshold to still , uh , adapt , um , the mean when if the utterance is , uh , long enough to to continue to adapt after , like , one second

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh , well , this doesn't help neither ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  but this doesn't hurt .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , well .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : s
C :  u Maybe it 's this this idea of having different on - line normalization ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  uh , actually , yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  S um , it 's very important to normalize C - zero

dialogue type : s
C :  and much less to normalize the other coefficients .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And , um ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  actu

dialogue type : s^e
C :  uh , well , at least with the current on - line normalization scheme .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And

dialogue type : s
C :  we I think , we kind of know that normalizing C - one doesn't help with the current scheme .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  and Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  In my idea , I I was thinking that the the the reason is maybe because of these funny things that happen between speech and silence which have different means .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Alright .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  W um ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  So that 's it , I think , for the on - line normalization .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  Yeah . I 've been playing a little bit with some kind of thresholding ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  and ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  mmm ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  as a first experiment , I think I

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bsc^rt
C :  no , the maximum energy of s each utterance

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , this for each mel band .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  well , uh , a couple of DB below this maximum ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Actually it was not a threshold ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  it was just adding noise .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  So I was adding a white noise energy ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  uh , that 's fifteen DB below the maximum energy of the utterance .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  When we look at at the , um , MFCC that result from this , they are a lot more smoother .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh|s^e
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  well , there is almost no difference between the cepstral coefficients of the two .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  And Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  And the result that we have in term of speech recognition , actually it 's not it 's not worse ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  it 's not better neither ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but it 's , um , kind of surprising that it 's not worse

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because basically you add noise that 's fifteen DB just fifteen DB below the maximum energy .

dialogue type : %-
C :  And

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's I think , it 's whitening This the portion that are more silent ,

dialogue type : s
C :  as you add a white noise that are has a very high energy , it whitens everything

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  and the high - energy portion of the speech don't get much affected anyway by the other noise .

dialogue type : s
C :  And as the noise you add is the same is the shape , it 's also the same .

dialogue type : s
C :  So they have the trajectory are very , very similar .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  I think it 's I think it 's different .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  It 's it 's something that yeah , that affects more or less the silence portions

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , anyway , the sp the portion of speech that ha have high energy are not ch a lot affected by the noises in the Aurora database .

dialogue type : s
C :  If if you compare th the two shut channels of SpeechDat - Car during speech portion , it 's n n n the MFCC are not very different .

dialogue type : s
C :  They are very different when energy 's lower ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  like during fricatives or during speech pauses .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C :  Ye

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
C :  Yeah . So it distort the speech .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  It didn't .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  So , but in this case I I really expect that maybe the the two these two stream of features , they are very different .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  I mean , and maybe we could gain something by combining them

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah . Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  I systematically add the noise ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but the , um , noise level is just some kind of threshold below the peak .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Which is not really noise , actually .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  It 's just adding a constant to each of the mel , uh , energy .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  To each of the mel filter bank .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , yeah , it 's really , uh , white noise .

dialogue type : %--
C :  I th

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Um .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
C :  Yeah . So may

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , the this threshold is still a factor that we have to look at .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  And I don't know , maybe a constant noise addition would would be fine also ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : h
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah . It was it was , uh , the same system .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^r
C :  It was the same system .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^tc.%--
C :  A third thing is that , um , I play a little bit with the , um finding what was different between , um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  And there were a couple of differences ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
C :  like the LDA filters were not the same .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  he had the France Telecom blind equalization in the system .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  the number o of MFCC that was were used was different .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  You used thirteen

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and we used fifteen .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , a bunch of differences .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And , um , actually the result that he he got were much better on TI - digits especially .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I 'm kind of investigated to see what was the main factor for this difference .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it seems that the LDA filter is is was hurting .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
C :  Um , so when we put s some noise compensation the , um , LDA filter that that 's derived from noisy speech is not more anymore optimal .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  And it makes a big difference , um , on TI - digits

dialogue type : s^e^rt
C :  trained on clean .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , if we use the the old LDA filter , I mean the LDA filter that was in the proposal , we have , like , eighty - two point seven percent recognition rate ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  um ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
C :  on noisy speech when the system is trained on clean speech .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s^e
C :  so from eighty - two point seven to eighty - five point one ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which is a huge leap .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  So now the results are more similar ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  and

dialogue type : s
C :  I don't I will not , I think , investigate on the other differences ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which is like the number of MFCC that we keep and other small things

dialogue type : s^e
C :  that we can I think optimize later on anyway .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah . I think th th uh , the new system that I tested is , I guess , closer

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because it doesn't have it have less of of France Telecom stuff ,

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : %
C :  Mmm ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I think we were gonna work with with this or this new system ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  But we will use the the LDA filters f derived from clean speech .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , yeah , actually it 's it 's not the the LDA filter .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's something that 's also short enough in in latency .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  And there is there is also this log energy versus C - zero .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Well .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  Uh , that 's it , I think .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : qy
C :  Are you still using only the ten first frame for noise estimation

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  or ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  Or i ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Maybe you have to standardize this thing also ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  noise estimation ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^df
C :  They all need some some noise noise spectra

dialogue type : s^df
C :  but they use every all use a different one .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %
C : 

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Yeah . I guess it 's the power spectrum of noisy speech .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^2
C :  Is it the first - order expansion ?

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah , I guess .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^nd.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qw^t3
C :  What is that ?

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's log o of capital Y .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah , right .

dialogue type : s^t1
C :  Capital Y .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah . Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah , sure .

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
C :  And the the model of clean speech is a codebook . Right ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
C :  It 's one mixture of the model . Right ?
