dialogue type : z
G :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt^t
G :  OK . Does anybody have an agenda ?

dialogue type : s
G :  I thought somebody had .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : s^j
G :  Yeah , we only want th useless things .

dialogue type : fg
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qh^t
G :  No , why don't we talk about practical things ?

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Great .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^t.%--
G :  OK , transcription , uh , microphone issues

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa.%--
G :  Yeah , well .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
G :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
G :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|qy^bu^d^rt
G :  Uh , bigram ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
G :  IRAM .

dialogue type : s^am
G :  Well , m maybe .

dialogue type : s^co^rt
G :  Yeah , let 's let 's see where we are at three - thirty .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^co
G :  Yeah . Th - now you get to tell us what 's the interesting part .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
G :  Um , and , um , the other thing , uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  which I 'll just say very briefly that maybe relates to that a little bit ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  which is that , um ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  uh , one of the suggestions that came up in a brief meeting I had the other day when I was in Spain

dialogue type : s^e
G :  with , uh , Manolo Pardo and Javier , uh , Ferreiros , who was here before ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  was , um , why not start with what they had before but add in the non - silence boundaries .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  h he was looking for , uh , speaker change points .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um .

dialogue type : s
G :  As a simplification , he originally did this only using silence as , uh , a putative , uh , speaker change point .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  And , uh , he did not , say , look at points where you were changing broad sp uh , phonetic class , for instance .

dialogue type : s
G :  And for Broadcast News , that was fine .

dialogue type : s
G :  Here obviously it 's not .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
G :  And , um , so one of the things that they were pushing in d in discussing with me is , um ,

dialogue type : s:qw
G :  w why are you spending so much time , uh , on the , uh , feature issue ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  uh , when perhaps if you sort of deal with what you were using before

dialogue type : s
G :  and then just broadened it a bit , instead of just ta using silence as putative change point also ?

dialogue type : s
G :  So then you 've got you already have the super - structure with Gaussians and H - you know , simple H M Ms and so forth .

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So there was a there was a little bit of a a a a difference of opinion

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because I I thought that it was it 's interesting to look at what features are useful .

dialogue type : s
G :  But , uh , on the other hand I saw that the they had a good point

dialogue type : s^cs
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Because ultimately we 're gonna end up with some s su kind of structure like that ,

dialogue type : s
G :  where you have some kind of simple HMM

dialogue type : s
G :  and you 're testing the hypothesis that , uh , there is a change .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  so anyway , I just reporting that .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : qh^t^tc
G :  So . Yeah , why don't we do the speech - nonspeech discussion ?

dialogue type : b^rt
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  That 's great .

dialogue type : fg|s^t
G :  Um , just qu one quickly , uh , still on the features .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  So you have these twenty - four features .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  Uh , a lot of them are spectral features .

dialogue type : qy
G :  Is there a a transformation , uh , like principal components transformation or something ?

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
G :  OK . No , I was j curious .

dialogue type : s
G :  Yeah , I don't think it 's a big deal for this application ,

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^fa^t3.%
G :  Excuse me .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^tc.%--
G :  The other thing , uh , to keep in mind ,

dialogue type : fh|%--
G :  uh I mean ,

dialogue type : s
G :  we 've been very concerned to get all this rolling

dialogue type : s
G :  so that we would actually have data ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but , um , I think our outside sponsor is actually gonna kick in

dialogue type : s
G :  and ultimately that path will be smoothed out .

dialogue type : s
G :  So I don't know if we have a long - term need to do lots and lots of transcribing .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  I think we had a very quick need to get something out

dialogue type : s
G :  and we 'd like to be able to do some later

dialogue type : sj^ba^df
G :  because just it 's inter it 's interesting .

dialogue type : s
G :  But as far a you know , uh , with with any luck we 'll be able to wind down the larger project .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  That 's great .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  That 's great .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , basically it 's it 's all the difference in the world .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , basically he 's he 's on it now .

dialogue type : s
G :  So so so this is so i it 'll happen .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  Yeah . I mean , basically it 's just saying that one of our one of our best people is on it ,

dialogue type : s
G :  you know , who just doesn't happen to be here anymore .

dialogue type : s
G :  Someone else pays him .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  So . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|sj^ba
G :  S OK . That 's that 's a good point .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy
G :  Have , uh , folks from NIST been in contact with you ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
G :  OK . Well , holidays may have interrupted things ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  They seem to want to get absolutely clear on standards for transcription standards and so forth with with us .

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Right . Because they 're they 're presumably going to start recording next month .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : h|s^na
G :  Um . Yeah , I don't think I mailed anybody .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  if , uh that that , uh , as the point person on it .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  So , yeah . Maybe I 'll , uh , ping them a little bit about it to get that straight .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  Yeah . So is it cuz with any luck there 'll actually be a a there 'll be collections at Columbia ,

dialogue type : s^rt
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean Dan Dan is very interested in doing some other things ,

dialogue type : s^2
G :  and collections at NIST .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^m
G :  Yeah , cross - correlation .

dialogue type : s
G :  I had mentioned this a couple times before , the c the commercial devices that do , uh , uh , voice , uh you know , active miking ,

dialogue type : s
G :  basically look at the amp at the energy at each of the mikes .

dialogue type : s
G :  And and you basically compare the energy here to some function of all of the mikes .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So ,

dialogue type : s
G :  by doing that , you know , rather than setting any , uh , absolute threshold , you actually can do pretty good , uh , selection of who who 's talking .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  And those those systems work very well , by the way ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  I mean , so people use them in panel discussions and so forth with sound reinforcement differing in in sort of ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Boy , the guy I knew who built them , built them like twenty twenty years ago ,

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  so they 're it 's the the techniques work pretty well .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Yeah . So I think , you know , basically you can look at some p you have to play around a little bit , uh , to figure out what the right statistic is ,

dialogue type : s
G : 

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  Uh , and we also have these we have the advantage of having distant mikes too .

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  So that , you cou yo

dialogue type : fh|s^no
G :  Um . I I don't know .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  If I was actually working on it , I 'd sit there and and play around with it ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and and get a feeling for it .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  I mean , the the the ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G :  But ,

dialogue type : s
G :  uh , you certainly wanna use the close - talking , as a at least .

dialogue type : s
G :  I don't know if the other would would add some other helpful dimension or not .

dialogue type : fg|s^co
G :  Well , uh , my suggestion now is is on all of these things to , uh , contact Brian .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , just talk to him about it .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , you know , basically he 's he just studies , he 's a colleague ,

dialogue type : s
G :  a friend ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  and ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  uh , they and and , you know , the the organization always did wanna help us .

dialogue type : s
G :  It was just a question of getting , you know , the right people connected in , who had the time .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%--
G :  No , I , eh , eh , p

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s^na
G :  Yeah , something happened .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I don't know what .

dialogue type : s
G :  But he 's on it now .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
G :  So , uh ,

dialogue type : qw^t^tc
G :  where are we ?

dialogue type : s^cs^rt.%--
G : 

dialogue type : qo^cs
G :  Well , let 's why don't we talk about microphone issues ?

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^na
G :  Oh , I probably would .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , my knowledge is twenty years out of date

dialogue type : s
G :  but some of it 's still the same .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
G :  Uh , so maybe we c we can take a look at that .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Well , let 's look at it together

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
G :  Who who are we buying these from ?

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  That 'd be

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Yeah . We we can try and look at that together .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , I think that that 's that 's a good back - off position .

dialogue type : s
G :  That 's what I was saying earlier ,

dialogue type : s
G :  th that , you know , we are gonna get some recordings that are imperfect

dialogue type : s:s
G :  and , hey , that 's life .

dialogue type : s
G :  But I I think that it it doesn't hurt , uh , the naturalness of the situation to try to have people wear the microphones properly , if possible ,

dialogue type : s
G :  because , um , the natural situation is really what we have with the microphones on the table .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , I think , you know , in the target applications that we 're talking about , people aren't gonna be wearing head - mounted mikes anyway .

dialogue type : s
G :  So this is just for u these head - mounted mikes are just for use with research .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  You know , if if An - Andreas plays around with language modeling , he 's not gonna be m wanna be messed up by people breathing into the microphone .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  But it does happen .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  I remember when I was when I I I I used , uh , um , a prominent laboratory 's , uh , uh , speech recognizer

dialogue type : s
G :  about , uh This was , boy , this was a while ago ,

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  this was about twelve twelve years ago or something .

dialogue type : fh
G :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
G :  they were they were perturbed with me

dialogue type : s
G :  because I was breathing in instead of breathing out .

dialogue type : s
G :  And they had models for they they had Markov models for br breathing out

dialogue type : s
G :  but they didn't have them for breathing in .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
G :  I

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  It it 's going to be imperfect .

dialogue type : s
G :  You 're not gonna get it perfect .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  And you can do some , uh , you know , first - order thing about it ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
G :  which is to have people move it , uh , uh , a away from being just directly in front of the middle

dialogue type : s^e
G :  but not too far away .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  Because you can't al you know , interfere w

dialogue type : s
G :  you can't fine tune the meeting that much , I think .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
G :  And then there 's mass .

dialogue type : s
G :  Anyway .

dialogue type : qw^rt
G :  About what ?

dialogue type : fg|%--
G : 

dialogue type : qh^cs^t
G :  why don't we do that ?

dialogue type : b^rt
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  Same thing .

dialogue type : s^ar
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , it 's it 's it 's always the same thing .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  we now think that laughter should have three sub sub sub - units in the the three states , uh different states .

dialogue type : s.%--

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^co^rt

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I 'm sure it 's very individual .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  one thing that c that we 're not doing , of course , is we 're not claiming to , uh , get be getting a representation of mankind

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Uh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  And Yeah , r right .

dialogue type : fh|qh
G :  So , uh , who knows .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : qh^cs^tc
G :  Yeah . Why don why don't we just since we 're on this vein , why don't we just continue with , uh , what you were gonna say about the transcriptions

dialogue type : fh
G :  and ?

dialogue type : b
G :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Right . Well Well , you know , it might be something we 'd wanna do with some , uh , s small subset of the whole thing .

dialogue type : s
G :  We certainly wouldn't wanna do it with everything .

dialogue type : b
G :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
G :  The other thing we could do , actually , uh , is , uh , use them for a more detailed analysis of the overlaps .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^aap
G :  Well , that 's one way to do it .

dialogue type : s^cs^ng
G :  But I 've been saying the other thing is just go through it for the overlaps .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  Given that y and and do so instead of doing phonetic , uh , uh , transcription for the whole thing ,

dialogue type : s
G :  which we know from the Steve 's experience with the Switchboard transcription is , you know , very , very time - consuming .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  And and you know , it took them I don't know how many months to do to get four hours .

dialogue type : s
G :  And so that hasn't been really our focus .

dialogue type : s
G :  Uh , we can consider it .

dialogue type : s
G :  But , I mean , the other thing is since we 've been spending so much time thinking about overlaps is is maybe get a much more detailed analysis of the overlaps .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
G :  But anyway , I 'm I 'm open to c our consideration .

dialogue type : s
G :  I I don't wanna say that by fiat .

dialogue type : s
G :  I 'm open to every consideration of what are some other kinds of detailed analysis that would be most useful .

dialogue type : fh
G :  And , uh , uh ,

dialogue type : s
G :  I I I think this year we we actually , uh , can do it .

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's a we have we have due to @ @ variations in funding we have we seem to be doing , uh , very well on m money for this this year ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and next year we may have have much less .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  Uh , I mean , calendar year two thousand one .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  Yeah . So it 's uh , it 's we don't wanna hire a bunch of people , a long - term staff ,

dialogue type : s
G :  because the the funding that we 've gotten is sort of a big chunk for this year .

dialogue type : s
G :  But having temporary people doing some specific thing that we need is actually a perfect match to that kind of , uh , funding .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I remember when we were transcribing BeRP , uh , uh , uh , Ron Kay , uh , volunteered to to do some of that .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  And , he was the first first stuff he did was transcribing Chuck .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  And he 's saying " You you know , I always thought Chuck spoke really well . "

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  It could be that they will uh theirs will end up being a kind of fir first pass or something .

dialogue type : s
G :  Maybe an elaborate one ,

dialogue type : s
G :  cuz again they probably are gonna do these alignments ,

dialogue type : s
G :  which will also clear things up .

dialogue type : s^am
G :  Well , tha that 's that 's debatable .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , so the so the argument is that if your statistical system is good it will in fact , uh , clean things up .

dialogue type : qy^d^f
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
G :  So it it 's got its own objective criterion .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  I mean , to give an example of , um , something we used to do , uh , at one point , uh , back back when Chuck was here

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  in early times ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  is we would take ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  um , da take a word and , uh , have a canonical pronunciation

dialogue type : s
G :  and , uh , if there was five phones in a word , you 'd break up the word , uh , into five equal - length pieces

dialogue type : s
G :  which is completely gross .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , th the timing is off all over the place in just about any word .

dialogue type : sj^ba^df^rt
G :  But it 's O K .

dialogue type : s
G :  You start off with that and the statistical system

dialogue type : s
G :  then aligns things ,

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  and eventually you get something that doesn't really look too bad .

dialogue type : s^bs
G :  So so I think using a a good aligner , um , actually can can help a lot .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um . But , uh ,

dialogue type : s
G :  you know , they both help each other .

dialogue type : s
G :  If you have a if you have a better starting point , then it helps the aligner .

dialogue type : s
G :  If you have a good alignment , it helps the , uh , th the human in in taking less time to correct things .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%

dialogue type : s
G :  Meaning really isn't my thing .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  We 're running a little short here .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  eh , was p Well , you know , the thing I 'm concerned about is we wanted to do these digits

dialogue type : s
G :  and and I haven't heard , uh , from Jose yet .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : h
G : 

dialogue type : s^ng.%--
G :  I I I think it you know , another another bunch of digits .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  More data is good .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  So so I 'd like to do that .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  But I think , do you , maybe ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  eh ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Did you prepare some whole thing you wanted us just to see ?

dialogue type : qrr
G :  Or what was that ?

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s
G :  But the bottom line is it 's still not , uh , separating out very well .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^co^tc
G :  that 's that 's enough then .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  No , I mean , that there 's no point in going through all of that if that 's the bottom line , really .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  Uh , I mean , there there 's two suggestions , really ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  which is , uh what we said before is that ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  it looks like ,

dialogue type : s
G :  at least that you haven't found an obvious way to normalize

dialogue type : s
G :  so that the energy is anything like a reliable , uh , indicator of the overlap .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  Um , I I 'm I 'm still a little f think that 's a little funny . These things l @ @ seems like there should be ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but but you don't want to keep , uh keep knocking at it if it 's if you 're not getting any any result with that .

dialogue type : s
G :  But , I mean , the other things that we talked about is , uh , pitch - related things and harmonicity - related things ,

dialogue type : s
G :  so which we thought also should be some kind of a reasonable indicator .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fh
G :  But , uh ,

dialogue type : s
G :  a completely different tack on it wou is the one that was suggested , uh , by your colleagues in Spain ,

dialogue type : s
G :  which is to say , don't worry so much about the , uh , features .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  That is to say , use , you know , as as you 're doing with the speech , uh , nonspeech , use some very general features .

dialogue type : s^cs^e
G :  And , uh , then , uh , look at it more from the aspect of modeling .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  You know , have a have a couple Markov models

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  and , uh , try to indi try to determine , you know , w when is th when are you in an overlap , when are you not in an overlap .

dialogue type : s
G :  And let the , uh , uh , statistical system determine what 's the right way to look at the data .

dialogue type : %--
G :  I I , um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  I think it would be interesting to find individual features and put them together .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  I think that you 'd end up with a better system overall .

dialogue type : s
G :  But given the limitation in time and given the fact that Javier 's system already exists doing this sort of thing ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  uh , but , uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  maybe that 's a better place to go .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^am
G :  Maybe .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  I see .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Ha - h have you ever looked at the , uh , uh Javier 's , uh , speech segmenter ?

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Oh . Maybe m you could , you kn uh show Thilo that .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Cuz again the idea is there the limitation there again was that he was he was only using it to look at silence as a as a as a as a p putative split point between speakers .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  But if you included , uh , broadened classes then in principle maybe you can cover the overlap cases .

dialogue type : b
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G :  N n

dialogue type : s^arp
G :  Well , it 's sort of has a simple one .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : qy
G :  it 's just it 's just a isn't it just a Gaussian

dialogue type : qy^e.%--
G :  for each ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d.%-
G :  Oh , it doesn't have it doesn't have any temporal , uh ?

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I gues I guess I don't remember either .

dialogue type : fh|s^df
G :  Uh . It 's been a while .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh , I see . I see .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^co^t
G :  O - k OK . So let me go back to what you had , though .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , it 's So you have two categories

dialogue type : s
G :  and you have Markov models for each .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Couldn't you have a third category ?

dialogue type : qy^d^e^rt
G :  So you have , uh you have , uh , nonspeech , single - person speech , and multiple - person speech ?

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
G :  And then you have a Markov model for each ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  I see .

dialogue type : s^bk^r
G :  I see .

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  This is all pretty gross .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , the th the reason why , uh , I was suggesting originally that we look at features is because I thought , well , we 're doing something we haven't done before ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  It seems like if two people two or more people talk at once , it should get louder ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  uh , and , uh , uh , there should be some discontinuity in pitch contours ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  and , uh , there should overall be a , um , smaller proportion of the total energy that is explained by any particular harmonic sequence in the spectrum .

dialogue type : s
G :  So those are all things that should be there .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^t3
G :  By the way , I was told I should be calling you Pepe ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^e
G :  by your friends ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  but

dialogue type : s^tc
G :  Anyway ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  um ,

dialogue type : s
G :  uh , the has has , uh , been exploring , uh , e largely the energy issue

dialogue type : fh
G :  and ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  um ,

dialogue type : s
G :  as with a lot of things , it is not uh , like this , it 's not as simple as it sounds .

dialogue type : s:qy
G :  And then there 's , you know Is it energy ? Is it log energy ? Is it LPC residual energy ? Is it is it is it , uh , delta of those things ?

dialogue type : s.%--:qw.%--
G :  Uh , what is it no

dialogue type : s
G :  Obviously , just a simple number absolute number isn't gonna work .

dialogue type : s:qw
G :  So it should be with compared to what ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Should there be a long window for the normalizing factor and a short window for what you 're looking at ?

dialogue type : s:qw
G :  Or , you know , how b short should they be ?

dialogue type : fh
G :  So ,

dialogue type : s
G :  th he 's been playing around with a lot of these different things

dialogue type : s
G :  and and so far at least has not come up with any combination that really gave you an indicator .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So

dialogue type : s
G :  I I still have a hunch that there 's it 's in there some place ,

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  but it may be given that you have a limited time here , it it just may not be the best thing to to to focus on for the remaining of it .

dialogue type : s
G :  So pitch - related and harmonic - related , I 'm I 'm somewhat more hopeful for it .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  But it seems like if we just wanna get something to work ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  Th - they were suggesting going to Markov models ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  uh , but in addition there 's an expansion of what Javier did .

dialogue type : s
G :  And one of those things , looking at the statistical component ,

dialogue type : s
G :  even if the features that you give it are maybe not ideal for it , it 's just sort of this general filter bank

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  Eee it 's in there somewhere probably .

dialogue type : b
G :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
G :  Let 's read some digits .
