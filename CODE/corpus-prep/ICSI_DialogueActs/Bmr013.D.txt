dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  So we 'll have a corpus that 's the size of TI - digits ?

dialogue type : s^m|s^bk
D :  Test set , OK .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  Oh ! Great .

dialogue type : sj^ba^r
D :  Great .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Good .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt
D :  So are these two separate tasks that can happen ?

dialogue type : qrr.%-
D :  Or do they have to happen at the same time before

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  Although the models weren't , that good ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  right ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
D :  I mean , the models are pretty crappy ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qw^tc
D :  How did we do on the TI - digits ?

dialogue type : qw.%-
D : 

dialogue type : %-
D :  H How

dialogue type : qw
D :  do we do on TI - digits ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^2^j
D :  Pre - prehistory .

dialogue type : s
D :  Sort of less predictability ,

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : fg
D :  Hey .

dialogue type : s
D :  Hafta think about , the particular acoustic features to mark , too , because , I mean , some things , they wouldn't be able to mark , like , uh , you know , uh , tense lax .

dialogue type : s
D :  Some things are really difficult .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
D :  You know ,

dialogue type : s
D :  just listening .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw^bu^m^rt
D :  Points of articulation ?

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  What do you mean ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Place of ar place of articulation .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK , I see .

dialogue type : s
D :  There was no name for that .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So it would be it would be great if we had , either these kind of , labelings on , the same portion of Switchboard that Steve marked , or , Steve 's type markings on this data , with these .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  And it 's more accurate than , phone labels .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bs
D :  So it 's like a continuum .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's you 're going all the way down ,

dialogue type : b
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's basically just having , multiple levels of of , information and marking , on the signal .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|sj.%--
D :  Well , you know , um I mean if we 're talking about , having the , annotators annotate these kinds of features , it seems like ,

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  The the question is , do they do that on , meeting data ?

dialogue type : qrr
D :  Or do they do that on , Switchboard ?

dialogue type : s^df^na
D :  Well cuz the yeah , and then also , if you did it on Switchboard , you would have , the full continuum of transcriptions .

dialogue type : s
D :  You 'd have it , from the lowest level , the ac acoustic features , then you 'd have the , you know , the phonetic level that Steve did ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  and ,

dialogue type : b
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 'd be a complete , set then .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  But it it might be good to do what Jane was saying uh , you know , seed it , with , guesses about what we think the features are , based on , you know , the phone or Steve 's transcriptions or something . to make it quicker .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Adjusting ?

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah , exactly .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Or you could start from the if we were gonna , do the same set , of sentences that Steve had , done , we could start with those transcriptions .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qr^rt.%--
D :  Are they busy for the next couple years , or ?

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  It 'd be very interesting though , to have that data .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  Of the f acoustic features ?

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
D :  Well won't you have that from their transcriptions ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So , current This week .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  You ordered them already ?

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Great .

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  So it 's a replacement for this headset mike ?

dialogue type : qw
D :  What 's the , um , style of the headset ?

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : z
D :  Oh , god .
