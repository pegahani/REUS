dialogue type : s
B :  I think for two years we were two months , uh , away from being done .

dialogue type : h|s^rt
B :  Uh , the , uh , TORRENT chip .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  We were two

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , uh , we went through it Jim and I went through old emails at one point

dialogue type : s
B :  and and for two years there was this thing saying , yeah , we 're we 're two months away from being done .

dialogue type : s
B :  It was very very believable schedules , too .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  It was very true .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  So we probably should wait for him to come before we do his .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  All in favor

dialogue type : h|s^j^nd
B :  Uh , I don't do anything .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  No , I mean , I I 'm involved in discussions with with people about what they 're doing ,

dialogue type : s^co
B :  but I think they 're since they 're here , they can talk about it themselves .

dialogue type : s
B :  I had another thought just now ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which is , uh , remember we were talking before about we were talking in our meeting about , uh , this stuff that some of the other stuff that Avendano did ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  where they were , um , getting rid of low - energy sections ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  if you did a high - pass filtering , as Hirsch did in late eighties to reduce some of the effects of reverberation , uh , uh , Avendano and Hermansky were arguing that , uh , perhaps one of the reasons for that working was ma may not have even been the filtering so much but the fact that when you filter a an all - positive power spectrum you get some negative values ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and you gotta figure out what to do with them if you 're gonna continue treating this as a power spectrum .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s^e
B :  set the negative values to zero .

dialogue type : s
B :  So if you imagine a a waveform that 's all positive ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which is the time trajectory of energy ,

dialogue type : s
B :  um , and , uh , shifting it downwards , and then getting rid of the negative parts , that 's essentially throwing away the low - energy things .

dialogue type : s
B :  And it 's the low - energy parts of the speech where the reverberation is most audible .

dialogue type : s^e.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So in this case you have some artificially imposed reverberation - like thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , you 're getting rid of some of the other effects of reverberation ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but because you have these non - causal windows , you 're getting these funny things coming in ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B :  uh , at n

dialogue type : fh
B :  And ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : qw.%--
B :  what if you did ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , there 's nothing to say that the the processing for this re - synthesis has to be restricted to trying to get it back to the original , according to some equation .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I mean , you also could , uh , just try to make it nicer .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  And one of the things you could do is , you could do some sort of VAD - like thing

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and you actually could take very low - energy sections and set them to some some , uh , very low or or near zero value .

dialogue type : fh
B :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bsc
B :  or pre - echoes ,

dialogue type : s^bsc
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  are are , uh , part of what 's causing the problem , you actually could get rid of them .

dialogue type : s
B :  Be pretty simple .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I mean , you do it in a pretty conservative way

dialogue type : s^e
B :  so that if you made a mistake you were more likely to keep in an echo than to throw out speech .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , it 's this room .

dialogue type : s^r
B :  It 's it 's this room .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  this micro close microphone and a distant microphone , he 's doing these different tests on .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
B :  Uh , we should do a measurement in here .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I g think we never have .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  I think it 's I would guess , uh , point seven , point eight seconds f uh , R T

dialogue type : s
B :  something like that ?

dialogue type : s
B :  But it 's you know , it 's this room .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  But the other thing is , he 's putting in w

dialogue type : s
B :  I was using the word " reverberation " in two ways .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  he 's taking out some reverberation ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but he 's putting in something ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because he has averages over multiple windows stretching out to twelve seconds ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which are then being subtracted from the speech .

dialogue type : s
B :  And since , you know , what you subtract , sometimes you 'll be you 'll be subtracting from some larger number

dialogue type : s
B :  and sometimes you won't .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So you can end up with some components in it that are affected by things that are seconds away .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , and if it 's a low energy compo portion , you might actually hear some funny things .

dialogue type : s
B :  I don't think just multiplying the signal by two would have any effect .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , I think if you really have louder signals , what you mean is that you have better signal - to - noise ratio .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  So if what you 're doing is improving the signal - to - noise ratio , then it would be better .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Well , yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  But it 's trained and tested on the same thing .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  So if the if the if you change in both training and test , the absolute level by a factor of two , it will n have no effect .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  Well , I don't understand then .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^ar
B :  Uh , no .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I mean , uh , there 's there 's nothing inherent about removing if you 're really removing ,

dialogue type : fh|s^nd
B :  uh , r uh , then I don't see how that would make it louder .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh , yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Well , you know , there is this .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Wait a minute .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : %--
B :  i

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Subtracting the the mean log spectrum is is is like dividing by the spectrum .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , depending what you divide by , if your if s your estimate is off and sometimes you 're you 're you 're getting a small number , you could make it bigger .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  there 's It it could be that there 's some normalization that 's missing ,

dialogue type : s
B :  or something

dialogue type : s^e.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , y you 'd think it shouldn't be larger ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but maybe in practice it is .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's something to think about .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : fg
B :  I 'm sorry ,

dialogue type : qr
B :  was his point eight percent , er , a a result on testing on Macrophone or or training ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that was done already .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  Uh , and it 's point eight ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  Oh , that 's a lot better .

dialogue type : qw.%-
B :  So , what w ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  uh , uh , uh , no .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because , uh , there 's a sample and hold in the A - toD.

dialogue type : s^df
B :  And these period these typically do have a DC offset .

dialogue type : s
B :  And and they can be surprisingly large .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  It depends on the electronics .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^na
B :  Yeah . The microphone isn't gonna pass any DC .

dialogue type : %--
B :  But but ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  typi

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Actually , there are instrumentation mikes that that do pass go down to DC .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But but ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^ar|s
B :  no , it 's the electronics .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  then there 's amplification afterwards .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And you can get ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^r.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I can't remember , one of the DARPA things .

dialogue type : s
B :  There was this big DC - DC offset

dialogue type : s
B :  we didn't we didn't know about for a while , while we were messing with it .

dialogue type : s
B :  And we were getting these terrible results .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then we were talking to somebody and they said , " Oh , yeah . Didn't you know ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Everybody knows that .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  There 's all this DC offset in th "

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  So , yes .

dialogue type : s
B :  You can have DC offset in the data .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  See , we have a different interpretation of this .

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  He says it doesn't work .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  I said , I think it works magnificently ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but just not for the task we intended .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Uh , it gets rid of the speech .

dialogue type : h|s
B :  Uh , it leaves you know , it leaves the junk .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  I mean , I I think it 's it 's tremendous .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  You see , all he has to do is go back and reverse what he did before ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  and he 's really got something .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Ex - exactly .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Yeah , you got it .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  So , it 's it 's a general rule .

dialogue type : s^co^j
B :  Just listen very carefully to what I say

dialogue type : s^co^j
B :  and do the opposite .

dialogue type : s^co^j
B :  Including what I just said .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  he he 's saying they have all these , uh , uh , different kinds of adaptation .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  You know , they have channel adaptation .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  They have speaker adaptation .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think it 's probably more than that .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I mean , so they they have I I thin think they use these , uh , uh , genone things .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  So there 's there 's these kind of , uh , uh , pooled models

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and and they can go out to all sorts of dependencies .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  They have tied states

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I I I don't real I 'm talk I 'm just guessing here .

dialogue type : s
B :  But I think I think they they don't just have triphones .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think they have a range of of , uh , dependencies .

dialogue type : qy
B :  So is that ? Uh , are are these results comparable ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So you you were getting with the , uh , Aurora baseline something like two point four percent on clean TI - digits , when , uh , training the SRI system with clean TR digits TI - digits .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  And , so , is your two point seven comparable ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  where you 're , uh , uh , using , uh , the submitted system ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's about the same ,

dialogue type : s
B :  maybe a little worse .

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : s
B :  You you were HTK .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  That 's right .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  so the comparable number then , uh for what you were talking about then , since it was HTK , would be the um , two point f

dialogue type : s^bk|s^aa
B :  Oh , right , right , right , right .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right . Right , right , right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  He 's doing some different things .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  good .

dialogue type : s
B :  So they are helping .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's good to hear .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  You 'd have to train the SRI system with with all the different languages .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 'd be a lot of work .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's the only thing .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  That 's true ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but I think that also when we 've had these meetings week after week , oftentimes people have not done the full arrange of things

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because on on whatever it is they 're trying , because it 's a lot of work , even just with the HTK .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  So , it 's it 's a good idea ,

dialogue type : s^arp^cs
B :  but it seems like it makes sense to do some pruning

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  first with a a test or two that makes sense for you ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  and then take the likely candidates and go further .

dialogue type : s
B :  I i Just to clarify something for me .

dialogue type : %--
B :  I

dialogue type : s
B :  They were supp Supposedly , in the next evaluation , they 're going to be supplying us with boundaries .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  So does any of this matter ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , other than our interest in it .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Do we ? I mean , is there some reason that we think that 's the case ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  But maybe we 'll get some insight on that when when , uh , the gang gets back from Crete .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because there 's lots of interesting problems , of course .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then the thing is if if they really are going to have some means of giving us fairly tight , uh , boundaries , then that won't be so much the issue .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um

dialogue type : fh
B :  But I don't know .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  although that 'd be hard .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Cuz I would have thought that having some kind of spectral information ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  you know , in the old days people would use energy

dialogue type : s
B :  and zero crossings , for instance uh , would give you some better performance .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Cuz you might have low - energy fricatives or or , uh stop consonants , or something like that .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bs
B :  Oh , that if you d if you use purely energy and don't look at anything spectral , then you don't have a good way of distinguishing between low - energy speech components and nonspeech .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  just as a gross generalization , most nonsp many nonspeech noises have a low - pass kind of characteristic ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  some sort of slope .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s^e
B :  an upward slope .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  uh , you know , at the beginning of a of a of an S sound for instance , just starting in , it might be pretty low - energy ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but it will tend to have this high - frequency component .

dialogue type : s
B :  Whereas , a a lot of rumble , and background noises , and so forth will be predominantly low - frequency .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Uh , you know , by itself it 's not enough to tell you ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , if you look up in Rabiner and Schafer from like twenty - five years ago or something , that 's sort of what they were using then .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s
B :  one could imagine combining them in different ways .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But but ,

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  I guess what you 're saying is that the the MLP - based one has the spectral information .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qy.%--
B :  Is ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  And that might not be optimal ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  but I mean , I guess in principle what you 'd want to do is have a uh , a probability estimated by each one

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and and put them together .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  This is cubic root of power spectra ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So , if you have this band - pass filter , you probably get n you get negative values .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : h
B :  Uh ,

dialogue type : qo^bu^d^rt
B :  last week you were also talking about building up the subspace stuff ?

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So so , in i i

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So you could do a different normalization for C - zero than for other things anyway .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I mean , the other thing I was gonna suggest is that you could have two kinds of normalization with with , uh , different time constants .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  you could do some normalization s uh , before the VTS ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and then do some other normalization after .

dialogue type : fh
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
B :  But but C - zero certainly acts differently than the others do ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Yeah . Well , you 're I think you 're the first one here to work with VTS ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  uh , maybe we could call someone else up who has ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  ask them their opinion .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't I don't have a good feeling for it .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  You you wouldn't even need to switch to cepstra .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then you have one number which is very dependent on the level cuz it is the level ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and the other which isn't .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Sure .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , one of the things we 've talked about maybe it might be star time to start thinking about pretty soon , is as we look at the pros and cons of these different methods , how do they fit in with one another ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because we 've talked about potentially doing some combination of a couple of them .

dialogue type : s
B :  Maybe maybe pretty soon we 'll have some sense of what their characteristics are ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  so we can see what should be combined .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^co
B :  Why don't we read some digits ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Sure .

dialogue type : z
B :  O K .
