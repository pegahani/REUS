dialogue type : s
C :  We m We may wind up with ver We we may need versions of all this garbage .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , we have one more coming .

dialogue type : z
C :  OK .

dialogue type : z
C :  Well , we can start doing it .

dialogue type : h|s^aa
C :  Um , yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
C :  No . There was there was Let 's see .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s^na
C :  She got an emai she was notified .

dialogue type : s
C :  Whether she knows is another question .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  So are the people going to be identified by name ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , then in terms of people worrying about , uh , excising things from the transcript , it 's unlikely .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Since it it does isn't attributed .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , I see ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Sure .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  No , I I wasn't complaining ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I just wanted to understand .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|qh^cs^tc.%--
C :  Um , OK . So why don't you tell us briefly

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  your give give your e normal schpiel .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
C :  By the way , Adam , we will be using the , uh , screen as well .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , you know .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
C :  Wow !

dialogue type : s^t^tc
C :  Organization .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So you guys who got email about this oh f uh , Friday or something about what we 're up to .

dialogue type : s
C :  Oh , this was about um , inferring intentions from features in context , and the words ,

dialogue type : s^e.%-
C :  like " s go to see " , or " visit " , or some

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
C :  You didn't get it ?

dialogue type : s
C :  I guess these g have got better filters .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Cuz I sent it to everybody .

dialogue type : s
C :  You just blew it off .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^co
C :  No , OK come in , sit down .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  If you grab yourself a microphone .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , you can sign afterwards .

dialogue type : s
C :  Afterwards .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it it it it it also has to be switched on , Nance .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  It 's on ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
C :  OK , good .

dialogue type : qw^br
C :  What ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba^bd
C :  Not important .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , what is important is that we understand what the proposed task is .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , the the i uh , Robert and I talked about this some on Friday .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And we think it 's well - formed .

dialogue type : s
C :  So we think it 's a well - formed , uh , starter task for this , uh , deeper understanding in the tourist domain .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , it 's the it 's it 's always all of it .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , in general it 's always going to be , the answer is , everywhere .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , so the notion is that , uh , this isn't real deep .

dialogue type : s
C :  But it 's deep enough that you can distinguish between these th three quite different kinds of , uh , going to see some tourist thing .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , so that 's that 's the quote " deep " that we 're trying to get at .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Not only doesn't it do it , but it also doesn't give you enough information to do it .

dialogue type : s
C :  It isn't like , if you just took what the front - end gives you , and used some clever inference algorithm on it , you would be able to figure out which of these is going on .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and this is Bu - I in general it 's gonna be true of any kind of deep understanding ,

dialogue type : s
C :  there 's gonna be contextual things ,

dialogue type : s
C :  there 're gonna be linguistic things ,

dialogue type : s
C :  there 're gonna be discourse things ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and they gotta be combined .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , my idea on how to combine them is with a belief - net ,

dialogue type : s^bd^df
C :  although it may turn out that t some totally different thing is gonna work better .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  You 're editing your slide ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^fa
C :  Oh . I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  OK . So . This is minutes taking minutes as we go ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  in his in his own way .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Anyway . So the thing is , i uh , d naively speaking , you 've you 've got a for this little task , a belief - net ,

dialogue type : s
C :  which is going to have as output , the conditional pr probability of one of three things ,

dialogue type : s:s
C :  that the person wants to uh , to View it , to Enter it , or to Tango with it .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s
C :  So that the the output of the belief - net is pretty well formed .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , then the inputs are going to be these kinds of things .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : qh
C :  is , uh , one , where do you get this i information from ,

dialogue type : qh
C :  and two , what 's the structure of the belief - net ?

dialogue type : qh^e
C :  So what are the conditional probabilities of this , that , and the other , given these things ?

dialogue type : s
C :  And you probably need intermediate nodes .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I we don't know what they are yet .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Oh , another thing you want is some information abou I think , about the time of day .

dialogue type : s
C :  Now , they may wanna call that part of context .

dialogue type : s
C :  But the time of day matters a lot .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
C :  Pe - people don't wanna enter them .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , if it 's not obvious , you may want to actually uh , point out to people that it 's closed you know , what they 're g going to is closed and they don't have the option of entering it .

dialogue type : s
C :  So another thing that can come up , and will come up as soon as you get serious about this is , that another option of course is to have a more of a dialogue .

dialogue type : s
C :  So if someone says something you could ask them .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  And Now , one thing you could do is always ask them ,

dialogue type : s^bd^df
C :  but that 's boring .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it also w it also be a pain for the person using it .

dialogue type : s
C :  So one thing you could do is build a little system that , said , " whenever you got a question like that I 've got one of three answers .

dialogue type : s
C :  Ask them which one you want . "

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  But that 's , um , not what we 're gonna do .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  You want the you want the ability to a You want the ability to ask ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but what you don't wanna do is onl build a system that always asks every time ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  and i

dialogue type : s^df
C :  That 's not getting at the scientific problem ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  In general you 're you know , it 's gonna be much more complex than that .

dialogue type : s
C :  a This is purposely a really simple case .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|qh
C :  Yeah . S so so the way that might come up , if you wanna Suppose you wanted to do that , you might say , " Um , as an intermediate step in your belief - net , is there a Source - Path - Goal schema involved ? "

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : qh
C :  And if so , uh , is there a focus on the goal ?

dialogue type : qh
C :  Or is there a focus on the path ?

dialogue type : s
C :  or something .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And that could be , uh , one of the conditiona

dialogue type : s
C :  you know , th the In some piece of the belief - net , that could be the the appropriate thing to enter .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : s^ar^r|s^df.%--
C :  No . See , the M - three - L is not gonna give th

dialogue type : s
C :  What he was saying is , the M - three - L does not have any of that .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  All it has is some really crude stuff saying , " A person wants to go to a place . "

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  M - three well , M - three - L itself refers to Multimedia Mark - up Language .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^am
C :  Well , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Is - i but they c they call it intention lattice ,

dialogue type : %-
C :  but tha

dialogue type : fg
C :  Anyway .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , th they 're gonna give us some cr uh or We can assume that y you get this crude information .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  About intention ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and that 's all they 're going to provide .

dialogue type : s
C :  And they don't give you the kind of object ,

dialogue type : s
C :  they don't give you any discourse history ,

dialogue type : s
C :  if you want to keep that you have to keep it somewhere else .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , they they kee they keep it by their lights .

dialogue type : s
C :  It may it may or may not be what what we want .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
C :  If i if Yeah , if it got as simple as that , yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  But it wouldn't .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  i Go go back to the the uh , th

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C :  Yeah , that slide .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , well I think we ought to d a As we have all along , d We we 've been distu distinguishing between situational context ,

dialogue type : s
C :  which is what you have as context ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and discourse context ,

dialogue type : s
C :  which you have as DH ,

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't know what the H means .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bd
C :  Whatever .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  So we can work out terminology later .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , they 're they 're quite distinct .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I mean , you need them both ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but they 're quite distinct .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , so what we were talking about doing , a a as a first shot , is not doing any of the linguistics .

dialogue type : s
C :  Except to find out what seems to be useful .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bd^df
C :  Uh , this may be a bad dis bad idea ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  but the idea is to take as a first goal , see if we could actually build a belief - net that would make this three way distinction uh , in a plausible way ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  given

dialogue type : s
C :  these We have all these transcripts

dialogue type : s
C :  and we 're able to , by hand , extract the features to put in the belief - net .

dialogue type : s:s^bk
C :  Saying , " Aha !

dialogue type : s^e:s
C :  here 're the things which , if you get them out of out of the language and discourse , and put them into the belief - net , it would tell you which of these three uh , intentions is most likely . "

dialogue type : s
C :  And if to actually do that , build it , um you know , run it y y run it on the data where you hand - transcribe the parameters .

dialogue type : s
C :  And see how that goes .

dialogue type : s
C :  If that goes well , then we can start worrying about how we would extract them .

dialogue type : qh
C :  So where would you get this information ?

dialogue type : s
C :  And , expand it to to other things like this .

dialogue type : s
C :  But if we can't do that , then we 're in trouble .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  I mean th th i i if you can't do this task ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C :  Uh , uh , yeah , or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well it i I if it if it 's the belief - nets , we we 'll switch to you know , logic or some terrible thing ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but I don't think that 's gonna be the case .

dialogue type : s
C :  I think that , uh , if we can get the information , a belief - net is a perfectly good way of doing the inferential combination of it .

dialogue type : qh
C :  The real issue is , do what are the factors involved in determining this ?

dialogue type : s^no^rt
C :  And I don't know .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  Hold on a s Hold on a second .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , I know .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Uh , uh , is it clear what 's going on here ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Take them into account .

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  But but you don't worry about h

dialogue type : s^m^na
C :  how to extract them .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , f let 's find out which ones we need first ,

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Let 's go back to th Let 's go back to the the the slide of data .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2|s^aa
C :  From that task , yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  So , uh , I think you all know this , but we are going to actually use this little room

dialogue type : s
C :  and start recording subjects probably within a month or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , this is not any lo any of you guys ' worry ,

dialogue type : s
C :  except that we may want to push that effort to get information we need .

dialogue type : s
C :  So our job is to figure out how to solve these problems .

dialogue type : s
C :  If it turns out that we need data of a certain sort , then the sort of data collection branch can be , uh , asked to do that .

dialogue type : s
C :  And one of the reasons why we 're recording the meeting for these guys is cuz we want their help when we d we start doing uh , recording of subjects .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  So , yeah y you 're absolutely right , though .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  No , you you will not have ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and there it is ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  But you know , y y

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Oh yeah , but to some extent this is a different discussion .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
C :  So . Uh , we we have to have this discussion of th the experiment , and the data collection , and all that sorta stuff

dialogue type : s
C :  and we do have , um , a student who is a candidate for wizard .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , she 's gonna get in touch with me .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's a student of Eve 's .

dialogue type : s
C :  FEY ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  Fey ?

dialogue type : s^e^rt
C :  Spelled FEY .

dialogue type : qy.%-
C : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
C :  You know her ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : qy.%-
C :  Sh - Is sh

dialogue type : s
C :  She 's graduated .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  So , anyway , she 's looking for some more part time work w while she 's waiting actually for graduate school .

dialogue type : s
C :  And she 'll be in touch .

dialogue type : s
C :  So we may have someone , uh , to do this ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and she 's got you know , some background in in all this stuff .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And is a linguist st

dialogue type : fh
C :  and , so

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  So . That 's So , Nancy , we 'll have an At some point we 'll have another discussion on exactly wha t t you know , how that 's gonna go .

dialogue type : s
C :  And um , Jane , but also , uh , Liz have offered to help us do this , uh , data collection and design and stuff .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , when we get to that we 'll have some people doing it that know what they 're doing .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , we that 's part of what we 'll have to figure out .

dialogue type : fh
C :  But , uh ,

dialogue type : s^t^tc
C :  the The problem that I was tr gonna try to focus on today was , let 's suppose by magic you could collect dialogues in which , one way or the other , you were able to , uh , figure out both the intention ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and set the context ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and know what language was used .

dialogue type : s
C :  So let 's suppose that we can get that kind of data .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : qh
C :  The issue is , can we find a way to , basically , featurize it

dialogue type : s
C :  so that we get some discrete number of features so that , uh , when we know the values to all those features , or as many as possible , we can w come up with the best estimate of which of the , in this case three little intentions , are most likely .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^co
C :  Go back .

dialogue type : %-
C :  To v

dialogue type : s
C :  to View it .

dialogue type : s^f
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
C :  To Enter it .

dialogue type : s
C :  Now those It seems to me those are cl you c you have no trouble with those being distinct .

dialogue type : s
C :  " Take a picture of it "

dialogue type : s
C :  you you might well want to be a really rather different place than entering it .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , for an object that 's at all big , uh , sort of getting to the nearest part of it uh , could be quite different than either of those .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C :  Well .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Well , anyway .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : qh
C :  Is there a construction , or the kind of object ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  or w uh , anything else that 's in the si It 's either in the in the s the discourse itself or in the context .

dialogue type : s
C :  So if it turns out that , whatever it is , you want to know whether the person 's uh , a tourist or not , OK ? that becomes a feature .

dialogue type : s
C :  Now , how you determine that is another issue .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  But fo for the current problem , it would just be , " OK , if you can be sure that it 's a tourist , versus a businessman , versus a native , " or something , uh , that would give you a lot of discriminatory power

dialogue type : s:s^fe
C :  and then just have a little section in your belief - net that said , " pppt ! "

dialogue type : s
C :  Though sin f in the short run , you 'd set them ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and see ho how it worked ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and then in the longer run , you would figure out how you could derive them . From previous discourse or w any anything else you knew .

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
C :  OK . So , first of all is ,

dialogue type : fh|qy
C :  uh , do e either of you guys , you got a favorite belief - net that you 've , you know , played with ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  JavaBayes or something ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s^co
C :  Well , anyway . f Get one .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  OK ? So y so one of th one of the things we wanna do is actually , uh , pick a package ,

dialogue type : s
C :  doesn't matter which one ,

dialogue type : s
C :  uh , presumably one that 's got good interactive abilities ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
C :  cuz a lot of what we 're gonna be d

dialogue type : s
C :  You know , we don't need the one that 'll solve massive , uh , belief - nets quickly .

dialogue type : %--
C :  d w

dialogue type : s
C :  These are not gonna get big in in the foreseeable future .

dialogue type : s
C :  But we do want one in which it 's easy to interact with and , uh , modify .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Because i that 's A lot of what it 's gonna be , is , um , playing with this .

dialogue type : s
C :  And probably one in which it 's easy to have , um , what amounts to transcript files .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^f
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
C :  So we make up cases that have these features ,

dialogue type : s.%--:s
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  There 're even ones tha that you can do learning

dialogue type : s
C :  OK ? So you have all their cases and and their results

dialogue type : s
C :  and you have a algorithms to go through and run around trying to set the the probabilities for you .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  probably that 's not worth it .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I mean , my guess is we aren't gonna have enough data that 's good enough to make the these data fitting ones worth it ,

dialogue type : s^df^no
C :  but I don't know .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I would say you guy the first task for you two guys is to um , pick a package .

dialogue type : s
C :  OK , and you wanna it s You know , the standard things

dialogue type : s^e.%--
C : 

dialogue type : %
C :  yeah , @ @ .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , as soon as we have one , we can start trying to , uh , make a first cut at what 's going on .

dialogue type : s
C :  But it what I like about it is it 's very concrete .

dialogue type : s
C :  OK ? We we have a we know what the outcomes are gonna be ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and we have some some data that 's loose ,

dialogue type : s
C :  we can use our own intuition ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and see how hard it is ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and , importantly , what intermediate nodes we think we need .

dialogue type : s
C :  So it if it turns out that just , thinking about the problem , you come up with things you really need to You know , this is the kind of thing that is , you know , an intermediate little piece in your belief - net . That 'd be really interesting .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
C :  No , th It turns out that there is a , uh The new end of Java libraries .

dialogue type : s
C :  OK , and it turns out one called

dialogue type : s
C :  Which is one that fair people around here use a fair amount .

dialogue type : s^no.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  The obvious advantage of that is that you can then , relatively easily , get all the other Java packages for GUIs or whatever else you might want to do .

dialogue type : s
C :  So that i that 's I think why a lot of people doing research use that .

dialogue type : s^bd
C : 

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I have no idea whether that 's the best choice

dialogue type : s
C :  an and there 're plenty of people around , students in the department who , you know , live and breathe Bayes - nets .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , uh ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  It 's OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , yeah , Kevin would be a good person to start with .

dialogue type : s
C :  Nancy knows him well .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't know I don't know whether you guys have met Kevin yet or not ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  So , yeah , we 're sort of committed to XML as the kind of , uh , interchange .

dialogue type : s
C :  But that 's , you know , not a big deal .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , in terms of of interchanging in and out of any module we build , It 'll be XML .

dialogue type : s
C :  And if you 're going off to queries to the ontology , for example , you 'll have to deal with its interface .

dialogue type : s
C :  But that 's that 's fine

dialogue type : fh
C :  an and um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  all of these things have been built with much bigger projects than this in mind .

dialogue type : s
C :  So they they have worked very hard .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  It 's kind of blackboards and multi - wave blackboards

dialogue type : s^e.%--
C :  and ways of interchanging and registering your

dialogue type : s^e
C :  a And so forth .

dialogue type : %--
C :  So ,

dialogue type : s
C :  that I don't think is even worth us worrying about just yet .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean if we can get the core of the thing to work , in a way that we 're comfortable with , then we ca we can get in and out of it with , uh , XML , um , little descriptors .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  I believe .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
C :  Uh , you could have an X yeah , you could make and XML format for that . Sure .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  you know , feature value XML format is probably as good a way as any .

dialogue type : s
C :  So it 's als Yeah , I guess it 's also worth , um , while you 're poking around , poke around for XML packages that um , do things you 'd like .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Sure .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And the question is , d you c you you 'll have to l We 'll have to l

dialogue type : s^rt
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na|s^nd
C :  It 'd be nice , but but I I I do I don't wanna count on it .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I mean , you can't you can't run your project based on the speculation that that the data will come ,

dialogue type : s^df^e
C :  and you don't have to actually design the nets .

dialogue type : s^am
C :  Could happen .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah . So in terms of of the , um the what the SmartKom gives us for M - three - L packages , it could be that they 're fine , or it could be eeh .

dialogue type : s
C :  You don't You know , you don't really like it .

dialogue type : s
C :  So we 're not we 're not abs we 're not required to use their packages .

dialogue type : s.x
C :  We are required at the end to give them stuff in their format ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but hey .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  It doesn't control what you do in you know , internally .

dialogue type : qw^br
C :  Huh ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C :  Yeah bu w I 'd like that this y yeah , this week , to ha to n to have y guys , uh , you know , pick the y you know , belief - net package

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and tell us what it is , and give us a pointer so we can play with it or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , then as soon as we have it , I think we should start trying to populate it for this problem .

dialogue type : s
C :  Make a first cut at , you know , what 's going on ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and probably the ea easiest way to do that is some on - line way .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , you can f figure out whether you wanna make it a web site

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  or You know , how

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  OK , I wasn't .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aap^cs.x
C :  Well , y Well , or both of them speak .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  We don't care .

dialogue type : s^aap^cs
C :  Well , I 'd like to also , though , uh , ha have a first cut at what the belief - net looks like .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Even if it 's really crude .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right . Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And , as I said , what I 'd like to do is ,

dialogue type : s:s
C :  I mean , what would be really great is you bring it in If if if we could , uh , in the meeting , say , you know , " Here 's the package ,

dialogue type : s:s
C :  here 's the current one we have , "

dialogue type : s:qw
C :  uh , you know , " What other ideas do you have ? "

dialogue type : s
C :  and then we can think about this idea of making up the data file .

dialogue type : %--
C :  Of ,

dialogue type : s
C :  uh , you know , get a t a p tentative format for it ,

dialogue type : s
C :  let 's say XML , that says , l you know , " These are the various scenarios we 've experienced . "

dialogue type : s.x
C :  We can just add to that

dialogue type : s.x
C :  and there 'll be this this file of them

dialogue type : s
C :  and when you think you 've got a better belief - net , You just run it against this , um this data file .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C :  Oh , yeah , unt until we know more .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah . So the answer , Johno , is that these are , at the moment , separate .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , what one hopes is that when we understand how the analyzer works , we can both worry about converting it to English and worry about how it could ex extract the parameters we need for the belief - net .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^no
C :  Oh , yeah . I don't know .

dialogue type : s
C :  n None of this is i n Neither of these projects has got a real tight time - line ,

dialogue type : s
C :  in the sense that over the next month there 's a there 's a deliverable .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  S so uh , it 's opportu in that sense it 's opportunistic .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  You know , just pppt !

dialogue type : s
C :  go on and do other things .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
C :  Probably not then ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  cuz y you probably can't drop the mail there anyway .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  Clear ?

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Of course they use the sample data .

dialogue type : fg|s^t^tc
C :  OK . We can end the meeting

dialogue type : s
C :  and call Adam ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and then we wanna s look at some filthy pictures of Heidelberg .

dialogue type : s
C :  We can do that as well .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Uh , is that OK ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Alright .

dialogue type : b
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : %-
C :  Ni
