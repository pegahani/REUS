dialogue type : qw^cs:qw
E :  How about You could say , if you 're giving a talk , how likely are you to be challenged ?

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  Well , sounds like you really need to know something kind of like that .

dialogue type : sj:qw
E :  You need to know sort of Bas - in in this meeting , sort of what is your social status ?

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
E :  right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qh
E :  I guess I 'm wondering how can you make a conclusion based on that , if you don't know about the meeting ?

dialogue type : s^no
E :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  I 'm just That 's why I was wondering about if you can put something about the d

dialogue type : s^rt
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
E :  No , I like the idea of putting down the the status information

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because I think you probably can get a lot of interest there can be a lot of interesting research on that .

dialogue type : qy^d.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^d^f
E :  Well I guess I was thinking maybe , you know how you were taking information off of the digits and putting it onto that ?

dialogue type : qy
E :  Could we put one more thing on here maybe ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw.%-
E : 

dialogue type : qw:s
E :  How about " optional but highly desirable " ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s:s
E :  Yeah , If not given we will estimate .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
E :  They 're very strong - willed .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
E :  You know ?

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  People He

dialogue type : sj^cs
E :  I think I think you can put " optional "

dialogue type : fg|sj^ba
E :  Yeah , I think it 's OK .

dialogue type : s^2.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2:s
E :  Which is more objective . than somebody evalu saying , I think I speak this or that .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
E :  Yeah , I was just gonna ask the same thing .

E : 

dialogue type : qy.%-
E : 

dialogue type : qr.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : qr^rt
E :  Do you mean state , or do you mean more broad than the state level ?

dialogue type : qr^bu^d.%-
E :  You mean like you know southern US , or northeastern or

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  If you wanted to get regions for American English you could copy what they did in TIMIT .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  They had divided things up into regions .

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No , no .

dialogue type : s
E :  It would only be f if you said American English

dialogue type : s
E :  then you 'd put the regions .

dialogue type : s
E :  For the others , you would just leave it .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bs
E :  We wouldn't have enough to really make them difference on those .

dialogue type : s
E :  Oh , it 's like six regions of the country or something .

dialogue type : s
E :  Very just a limited number

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : sj^ba
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  You 'd just leave them .

dialogue type : s
E :  You don't even ask .

dialogue type : s.%--:s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
E :  And that would apply to everybody then ?

dialogue type : fh
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  And then you could map those to the TIMIT regions later , if people wanted to .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  That 's more general .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  That 's true .

dialogue type : qy^2^bu^d^rt
E :  A lot of post - processing .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Yeah , y there is actu you made me think about another wrinkle in this whole thing , which is that just asking them where they grew up between certain ages isn't enough ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because somebody could grow up in Germany but live on an army base speaking English .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs.%--:qw.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh that 's nice , OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
E :  Sort of like as soon as you get to the cases on the edge , the complexity just shoots up .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Well , you know the other thing , too , is that it seems like th one of the reasons you would gather real detailed information about their native language is if you were gonna do fine - grained phonetic analysis or something .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  Well that 's what I was gonna ask ,

dialogue type : qy.%-
E : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  Were they putting down where they lived at the moment they m recordings were made ?

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
E :  Is that why ?

dialogue type : qy^d^e^g^rt
E :  Rather than where they grew up ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu^cs
E :  So , then we probably don't need the fine - grained information .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  It can't be relied on only .

dialogue type : s^aa^rt|sj^ba
E :  Yeah , I think those are good .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
E :  I don't think you really have to do all that much .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  N Right . Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
E :  N detec

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  And then there will be people who live in an English speaking country , but all their meetings are held in another language .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So ,

dialogue type : s^t3
E :  Yochai 's company is like that .

dialogue type : s^t3
E :  Everybody speaks Hebrew .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
E :  PIN .

dialogue type : qw
E :  what about all of the meetings that have been recorded so far that without this ?

dialogue type : qo.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bs.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw.%-
E :  What about that error that that uh the the supposed lub

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  We were guessing you had a bug before

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Ah .

dialogue type : qr.%-
E : 

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  hmm , I 'm just trying to remember where we were ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  but uh , were you were interested in finding out if you can tell the difference between overlap and single speakers by looking at the e energy ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
E :  like say , for example , the mean of the energy .

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
E :  Was that the idea ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , if you look at on this page that has uh frame energy ,

dialogue type : s
E :  you look at the mean for the overlap , that 's forty - four point sixty - two versus the mean for the speakers , thirty - nine point sixty - two ,

dialogue type : s
E :  so there seems to be more energy when there 's overlapping which makes sense ,

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
E :  different than standard deviation .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
E : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
E :  On the overlap category , is that overlapping of speakers only ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
E :  It doesn't include some of the other sounds ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : qw
E :  Just out of curiosity , what was the bug ?

dialogue type : qw^r
E :  What was the bug that you found ?

dialogue type : s
E :  The bug from last uh meeting ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm !

dialogue type : qy^d
E :  So it was positioning randomly ?
