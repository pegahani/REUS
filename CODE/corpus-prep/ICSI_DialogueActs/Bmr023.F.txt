F :  Channel five ?

dialogue type : z
F :  Channel five .

dialogue type : z
F :  I 'm on channel five .

dialogue type : z
F :  Little low ?

dialogue type : z
F :  Channel five .

dialogue type : z
F :  Channel five .

dialogue type : z
F :  OK .

dialogue type : z
F :  Is it ?

dialogue type : z
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : z
F :  Maybe it should be a little higher .

dialogue type : z
F :  It 's not showing much .

dialogue type : z
F :  Test , test , test , test , test , test , test , test , test , test .

dialogue type : z
F :  OK , that that seems better ?

dialogue type : z
F :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : z
F :  OK , good .

dialogue type : z
F :  Ah , that 's good , that 's good .

dialogue type : z
F :  That 's

dialogue type : z
F :  Ahh . Mmm .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
F :  So I I had a question for Adam .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Have we started already ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy
F :  Is Jane around

dialogue type : qrr.%--
F :  or ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Yeah . Great idea .

dialogue type : s^t
F :  I was gonna ask Adam to , uh , say if he thought anymore about the demo stuff

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because it occurred to me that this is late May and the DARPA meeting is in mid July .

dialogue type : fh|s^no.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I know that we were gonna do something with the transcriber interface is one thing ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but I thought there was a second thing .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  Anybody remember ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
F :  Alright . So anyway , you have to sort out that out

dialogue type : s^co
F :  and get somebody going on it

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz we 're got a got a month left basically .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um

dialogue type : qw^t^tc
F :  OK . So , what are we g else we got ?

dialogue type : s
F :  You got you just wrote a bunch of stuff .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  oh .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's cool .

dialogue type : qr.%-
F :  So , the choice is , uh , which which do we want more , the the the comparison , uh , of everybody saying them at the same time or the comparison of people saying the same digits at different times that ?

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  I know that .

dialogue type : qw.%-
F :  But , you know , which opportunity should we

dialogue type : s^aa^m
F :  exploit ? Unison .

dialogue type : s^am
F :  I guess we 'll see

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  i I guess it 's dependent on

dialogue type : s^e^m
F :  how long we go and how good the snack is out there .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Yeah . Hmm . Get some advance intelligence .

dialogue type : s^co^na
F :  Yeah . We 'd have to train .

dialogue type : s^co
F :  Yeah . We 'd have to get s get some experience .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba^j
F :  Really boring chorus .

dialogue type : fh|qy^t^tc
F :  Um . Do we have an agenda ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Adam usually tries to put those together , but he 's ill .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw
F :  Uh ju what what might those be ?

dialogue type : s^m
F :  Meeting info organized .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : qy
F :  Is there stuff that 's happened about , um , uh , the SRI recognizer et cetera ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
F :  tho those things that were

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Is is that still sort of where it was , uh , the other day ?

dialogue type : s^bu^m
F :  We 're improving .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  Just with with age , kind of .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^j
F :  That 's pretty funny .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^fe
F :  Ah !

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
F :  Yeah . Well , that 's always good to do .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  Y think you think we should increase the error rate .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Good .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Good .

dialogue type : qh^rt^t^tc
F :  So , uh , why don't we , uh , do the IBM stuff ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  You had some thing about that ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2^j
F :  The , uh , Chuck chunks .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
F :  Uh , maybe we should have you record A , B , C for those or something .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^rt
F :  OK . Do w do what Do you have any idea of the turn - around on on those steps you just said ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
F :  Including IBM 's .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , I meant the overall thing .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  e e u u The reason I 'm asking is because , uh , Jane and I have just been talking , and she 's just been doing . Uh , e a , you know , further hiring of transcribers .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so we don't sort of really know exactly what they 'll be doing , how long they 'll be doing it , and so forth ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because right now she has no choice but to operate in the mode that we already have working .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And , uh ,

dialogue type : s^co
F :  so it 'd be It 'd be good to sort of get that resolved , uh , soon as we could ,

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  You know , that we we actually have a stream going and we know how how well it does and how and how it operates .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  I think that would that would certainly be a a very good thing to know .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^cs^t^tc
F :  Maybe before we do the meeting info organize thing , maybe you could say relevant stuff about where we are in transcriptions .

dialogue type : s^j
F :  They die off after they do this for a while .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
F :  No backs .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  in the unlikely event that we actually find that we have , uh , transcribers on staff who are twiddling their thumbs

dialogue type : s
F :  because , you know , there 's , you know , all the stuff that that was sitting there has been transcribed and they 're and they 're faster the the pipeline is faster than uh , than the generation ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  eh , i in in the day e event that that day actually dawns , uh , I I bet we could find some other stuff for them to do .

dialogue type : s
F :  So I I think that , eh , eh , a as we were talking , if we if we hire twelve , then we could , you know , run into a problem later .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , we also just couldn't sustain that forever .

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  but if we hire f you know , f we have five on staff five or six on staff at any given time , then it 's a small enough number so we can be flexible either way .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Good .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|qy^bu^rt^t^tc
F :  So , uh , u you were saying something about organizing the meeting info ?

dialogue type : qy^j^rt
F :  Did you record it ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  Now would the ones that , um , are already transcribed we h we have enough there that c

dialogue type : s
F :  you know , we 've already done some studies and so forth

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fh|qy^cs
F :  um , shouldn't we go through and do the business - es u of of having the , um , uh , participants approve it , uh , for approve the transcriptions for distribution and so forth ?

dialogue type : s^co
F :  Well , le let me put in another sort of a milestone kind of as as I did with the , uh , uh the the pipeline .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Um , we are gonna have this DARPA meeting in the middle of July ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  given that we 've been we 've given a couple public talks about it already , spaced by months and months , I think it 'd be pretty bad if we continued to say none of this is available .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs:s
F :  Right . So we can s we we wanna be able to say " here is a subset that is available right now "

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and that 's has been through the legal issues and so forth .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  OK ?

dialogue type : fh|s^e
F :  So , by before July .

dialogue type : s^aap.%-
F :  Well , in principle , yes . But , I mean , i if if if somebody actually did get into some legal issue with it then we

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  I it you know , there there is a point at which I agree it becomes ridiculous

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because , you know , you could do this final thing and then a year from now somebody could say , you know , that should be a period and not a question mark .

dialogue type : qh^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s:qy
F :  And you don't you there 's no way that we 're gonna go back and ask everybody " do you approve this , uh , you know this document now ? "

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s:s^co
F :  So I think what it is is that the the the the thing that they sign I I haven't looked at it in a while , but it has to be open enough that it sort of says " OK , from now on you know , now that I 've read this , you can use do anything you want with these data . "

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  Well , I forget how we end

dialogue type : s
F :  Right . I forget how we ended up on this ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but I remember my taking the position of not making it so so easy for everybody to observe everything

dialogue type : s
F :  and Adam was taking the position of of having it be really straightforward for people to check every aspect of it including the audio .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  And I don't remember who won , Adam or me ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Uh , that that 's why I 'm bringing this up again , because I can't remember how we ended up .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  That it was the transcrip

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^e
F :  that would give you access to the transcript and the audio .

dialogue type : s^bd
F :  That 's what Adam wanted .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  And I don't remember how we ended up .

dialogue type : s^j.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^2^j
F :  They disappeared from view .

dialogue type : h
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
F :  W

dialogue type : fg|s^df
F :  anyway , haven't we we 've gone down this path a number of times . I know this can lead to extended conversations and and not really get anywhere ,

dialogue type : s^co
F :  so let let me just suggest that uh , off - line that , uh , the people involved figure it out and take care of it before it 's July .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df:s
F :  OK . So so that in July we can tell people " yes , we have this and you can use it " .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^co^t^tc
F :  So , let 's see .

dialogue type : qo^t^tc
F :  What else we got ?

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
F :  Uh . Don did did a report about his project in class

dialogue type : fh|s^e
F :  and , uh an oral and written written version .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  So that was stuff he was doing with you .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  So the dominant features , including everything , were those those quasi - cheating things .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^e.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  On the average .

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : qh^cs.%-
F :  How about time position normalized by speak

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Great .

dialogue type : qy.%--
F :  Has has , uh ? We just I think , just talked about this the other day , but h has has anybody had a chance to try changing , uh , insertion penalty sort of things with the with the , uh uh , using the tandem system input for the ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^2
F :  So that 's So that 's not the problem .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah . We get twelve of those ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  huh ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Great .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Good .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  OK . So then then we 'll have our baseline to to compare the currently hideous , uh , uh , new thing with .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df
F :  Right . But all of these effects were j like a couple percent .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^m^t1.%--
F :  Add all of them .

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  I thought one was one point five percent and one was point eight .

dialogue type : s
F :  That 's three point three .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah . But the part that 's actually adjustment of the front - end per se as opposed to doing putting VTLN in or something is it was a couple percent .

dialogue type : s
F :  Right ? It was it was there was there was one thing that was one and a half percent and one that was point eight .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  let me see if I remember what they were .

dialogue type : s
F :  One of them was , uh , the change to , uh because it did it all at once , to uh , from bark scale to mel scale ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which I really feel like saying in quotes ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because @ @ they 're essentially the same scale

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but the but but but any i individual particular implementation of those things puts things in a particular place .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I still haven't looked at it yet .

dialogue type : s
F :  I I wanna look at exactly where the filters were in the two ,

dialogue type : s^am
F :  and it it 's probably something like there 's one fewer or one more filter in the sub one kilohertz band

dialogue type : s
F :  and for whatever reason with this particular experiment it was better

dialogue type : s
F :  one way or the other .

dialogue type : s^am^bd^cs
F :  Um , it could be there 's something more fundamental

dialogue type : s^bd^df^no
F :  but it you know , I I don't know it yet .

dialogue type : s
F :  And the other and the other that was like one and a half or something ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and then there was point eight percent ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qw^t1
F :  what was the other thing ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  Yeah . Those those two were together .

dialogue type : s
F :  We d weren't able to separate them out

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz it was just done in one thing .

dialogue type : s
F :  But then there was a point eight percent which was something else .

dialogue type : qy.%-
F :  Do you remember the ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Oh , yeah . So that was that was , uh that one I can claim credit for , uh , i in terms of screwing it up in the first place .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  So that someone e until someone else fixed it ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : %--
F :  when I u

dialogue type : s
F :  We had some problems before with offsets .

dialogue type : s
F :  This inf this went back to , uh , I think Wall Street Journal .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  ea everybody else who was doing Wall Street Journal knew that there were big DC offsets in th in these data in those data

dialogue type : s
F :  and and and nobody happened to mention it to us ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and we were getting these , like , really terrible results ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  like two , three times the error everybody else was getting .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  And then in casual conversation someone ment mentioned " uh , well , I guess , you know , of course you 're taking care of the offsets . "

dialogue type : s:qw
F :  I said " what offsets ? "

dialogue type : s
F :  And at that point , you know , we were pretty new to the data

dialogue type : s
F :  and we 'd never really , like , looked at it on a screen

dialogue type : s^fe
F :  and then when we just put it on the screen and wroop !

dialogue type : s
F :  there 's this big DC offset .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  So , um , in PLP

dialogue type : s^ar|s
F :  No . It 's just , it it 's it 's not at all uncommon for for recorded electronics to have different , um , DC offsets .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  It 's it 's , you know , no big deal .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's you know , you could have ten , twenty , maybe thirty millivolts , whatever ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and it 's consistently in there .

dialogue type : s
F :  The thing is , most people 's front - ends have pre - emphasis with it , with zero at zero frequency ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so that it 's irrelevant .

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh , but with P L P , we didn't actually have that .

dialogue type : s
F :  We had we had the equivalent of pre - emphasis in a a , uh , Fletcher - Munson style weighting that occurs in the middle of P L

dialogue type : s
F :  but it doesn't actually have a zero at zero frequency ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  like , eh , uh , typical simple fr pre - emphasis does .

dialogue type : s
F :  We had something more fancy .

dialogue type : s
F :  It was later on

dialogue type : s
F :  it didn't have that .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  So at that point I reali " oh sh we better have a have a high - pass filter "

dialogue type : s
F :  just , you know just take care of the problem .

dialogue type : s
F :  So I put in a high - pass filter at , uh , I think ninety ninety hertz or so uh , for a sixteen kilohertz sampling rate .

dialogue type : s
F :  And I never put anything in to adjust it for different different sampling rates .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so well , so , you know , the code doesn't know anything about that

dialogue type : s
F :  and so this is all at eight kilohertz

dialogue type : s
F :  and so it was at forty - five hertz instead of at instead of at ninety .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
F :  He made it a parameter .

dialogue type : s
F :  So . Yeah , I guess if he did it right , he did fix it

dialogue type : s
F :  and then and then it 's taking care of sampling rate ,

dialogue type : s
F :  which is great .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  Yeah . Does HPF on on his feat feature .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , frankly , we never did that with the RASTA filter either ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so the RASTA filter is actually doing a different thing in the modulation spectral domain depending on what sampling rate you 're doing ,

dialogue type : s
F :  which is another old old bug of mine .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Um . So that that was the problem there was th we we we had always intended to cut off below a hundred hertz

dialogue type : s
F :  and it just wasn't doing it ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so now it is .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , that hep that helped us by , like , eight tenths of a percent .

dialogue type : s
F :  It still wasn't a big deal .

dialogue type : s^aap
F :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  But but , I guess my my point was that that , um , the hybrid system thing that we did was , uh , primitive in many ways .

dialogue type : s
F :  And I think I agree with you that if we fixed lots of different things and they would all add up , we would probably have a a a competitive system .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
F :  But I think not that much of it is due to the front - end per se .

dialogue type : s
F :  I think maybe a couple percent of it is , as far as I can see from this .

dialogue type : s^bd
F :  Uh , unless you call well , if you call VTL the front - en front - end , that 's , uh , a little more .

dialogue type : s^bd
F :  But that 's sort of more both , kind of .

dialogue type : s^f
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  But .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
F :  Well , that 's what we 're seeing in other areas . Yes .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : %--
F :  So , it 's so ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , the reason to think it should is because you 're putting in the same information and you 're transforming it to be more discriminative .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So . Um .

dialogue type : s
F :  Now the thing is , in some databases I wouldn't expect it to necessarily give you much

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and and part of what I view as the real power of it is that it gives you a transformational capability for taking all sorts of different wild things that we do ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  not just th the standard front - end ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  but other things , like with multiple streams and so forth ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and allows you to feed them to the other system with this through this funnel .

dialogue type : s
F :  Um , so I think I think that 's the real power of it .

dialogue type : s
F :  I wouldn't expect huge in huge improvements .

dialogue type : s
F :  Um , but it should at least be roughly the same and maybe a little better .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  Let let me let me just ask you something .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
F :  When you say take the fifty - six outputs , these are the pre final nonlinearity outputs

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^e
F :  through the KLT .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
F :  And so so then you u Do you use all fifty - six of the KLT

dialogue type : qrr.%--
F :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
F :  Uh . Talk with Stephane .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  He did some things like that .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
F :  It was either him or Carmen .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I forget .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean these were all different databases and different you know , in HTK and all that ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so i it it may not apply .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  But my recollection of it was that it didn't make it better but it didn't make it worse .

dialogue type : s
F :  But , again , given all these differences , maybe it 's more important in your case that you not take a lot of these low - variance , uh , components .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  Which could be good or not .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
F :  Yeah . Worth trying .

dialogue type : s^am
F :  There might be ,

dialogue type : s^ba^df
F :  cuz that 's a pretty big difference .

dialogue type : fh
F :  But

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : %-
F :  What if ?

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  well , and another one is the normalization of the inputs to the net .

dialogue type : s
F :  These nets are trained with particular normalization

dialogue type : s
F :  and when that gets screwed up it it can really hurt it .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  Well , you might e e

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
F :  Yeah . I I would actually double check with Stephane at this point ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , he and Dan are the ones who are at this point most experienced with the tandem

dialogue type : s
F :  thing and there may there may be some little bit here and there that is not not being handled right .

dialogue type : s^arp^j
F :  Not unless you had a lot of time

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : fg|%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  Well , you actually are .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  But but it but in an indirect way .

dialogue type : s
F :  So wha w what an and you may not be in this case ,

dialogue type : s
F :  come to think of it ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because , uh , you 're just taking something that 's trained up elsewhere .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , what what you what you do in the full procedure is you , um , uh , have an embedded training .

dialogue type : s
F :  So in fact you the the net is trained on , uh , uh , a , uh , Viterbi alignment of the training data that comes from your full system .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so that 's where the feedback comes all around , so that it is actually discriminant .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  You can prove that it 's it 's a ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  If you believe in the Viterbi assumption that , uh , getting the best path , uh , is almost equivalent to getting the best , uh , total probability , um , then you actually do improve that by , uh by training up on local local , uh local frames .

dialogue type : s
F :  But , um , we aren't actually doing that here ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because we did we did that for a hybrid system ,

dialogue type : s^df^e
F :  and now we 're plugging it into another system

dialogue type : s
F :  and so it isn't i i i it wouldn't quite apply here .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah . Another thing is since you 're not using the net for recognition per se but just for this transformation , it 's probably bigger than it needs to be .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that would save a lot of time .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^am
F :  Yeah . Actually all those things could could could could , uh could affect it as well .

dialogue type : s
F :  The other thing , uh , just to mention that Stephane this was an innovation of Stephane 's , which was a pretty neat one ,

dialogue type : s
F :  uh , and might particularly apply here , given all these things we 're mentioning .

dialogue type : s
F :  Um , Stephane 's idea was that , um , discriminant , uh , approaches are great .

dialogue type : s
F :  Even the local ones , given , you know , these potential outer loops which , you know , you can convince yourself turn into the global ones .

dialogue type : s
F :  Um , however , there 's times when it is not good .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Uh , when something about the test set is different enough from the training set that that , uh , the discrimination that you 're learning is is is not a good one .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , uh , his idea was to take as the input feature vector to the , uh , Gaussian mixture system , uh , a concatenation of the neural net outputs and the regular features .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^bd
F :  Yeah . I mean , I 'm sure that Stephane wasn't the first to think of it ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but actually Stephane did it

dialogue type : s
F :  and and and it helped a lot .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that 's that that 's our current best best system in the , uh uh , in the Aurora thing .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^br
F :  I I , uh , missed what you said .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bd
F :  Well , actually , I , uh you should check with him ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because he tried several different combinations .

dialogue type : s^bk|%-
F :  Yeah . I , uh , th

dialogue type : s^no
F :  what I don't remember is which came out best .

dialogue type : s
F :  So he did one where he put o put e the whole thing into one KLT ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and another one , since the the PLP things are already orthogonalized , he left them alone and and just did a KLT on the on the on the net outputs

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and then concatenated that .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  And I don't remember which was better .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^no
F :  No . I don't know , i I I don't know .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  You have to check with him .

dialogue type : s
F :  I 'm into big ideas these days .

dialogue type : s
F :  Not to mention the fact that we 're missing snacks .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
F :  Uh

dialogue type : h
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  I I g I think , given that we 're in a hurry for snacks , maybe we should do them together .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  Well , it 's it 's it 's not You know , it 's not gonna work out

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  but we could we could just , uh , uh , see if we find a rhythm ,

dialogue type : s^f
F :  you know ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : qr
F :  Uh , O 's or zeroes ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  we wanna agree on that ?

dialogue type : s^cs^ng
F :  Oh , but if we were a singing group , we would wanna decide .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : %-
F :  We might wa

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  So these are excellent .

dialogue type : qh^cs.%-
F :  Why don't we do zer

dialogue type : qo^rt
F :  i Anyone have a problem with saying zero ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Is zero OK ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  One and a two and three .

dialogue type : z
F :  Once more with feeling .

dialogue type : z
F :  No , just k just kidding .

dialogue type : z
F :  Oh , yeah . It was .
