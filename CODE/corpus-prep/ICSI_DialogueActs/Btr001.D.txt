dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  One thing that I remember being really difficult at the beginning and it got easier as we went along was , um , acronyms and technical terms .

dialogue type : fh|s^df^rt
D :  Um , because there are so many

dialogue type : s^df.%--
D :  and

dialogue type : fh
D :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s^no
D : 

dialogue type : s^e
D :  computers and speech recognition .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I 've never taken classes on it or anything ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so . I found that really hard .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  You know , every five words there 'd be something I 'd put in parentheses cuz I didn't know what it was .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but it 's definitely gotten easier because the same things keep getting repeated ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  once you learn what it is , and you can say , " OK I know what they meant by that "

dialogue type : s
D :  or " I know how to spell that now "

dialogue type : s
D :  or something like that .

dialogue type : s
D :  And the Cast of Characters that you put up on the Web was helpful

dialogue type : s^e
D :  also .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Especially when describing like the set - up in this room , also , and the different types of mikes .

dialogue type : fh
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
D :  And it 's hard to tell when people are talking relatively quickly .

dialogue type : s^df^rt
D :  They just glide over some of the letters .

dialogue type : s^df^rt
D :  They don't fully pronounce them .

dialogue type : s
D :  So you can't really tell even if you listen to it ten times @ @ what it is .

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Even though I still don't know what they are .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I mean , I assume they 're microphones of some sort ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but that 's all .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  About the microphone ?

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I can't remember .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  I mean he 's e

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  he he said that they were designed for a specific sized head ?

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  And so if if your head happened to be that size , then you were fine

dialogue type : s
D :  and if it w was bigger , then it was like torture ,

dialogue type : s^no
D :  o or I don't know .

dialogue type : fh
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Oh , it doesn't look so bad ,

dialogue type : s^bd
D :  but , I guess it depends really .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  That 's interesting .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  For me I found the Spanish speakers to be the hardest .

dialogue type : s
D :  And the German speakers I found a little bit easier ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  and I thought maybe that was because I had I took German for a semester and I 've had exposure to German ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  um , because I had a lot of friends who were really into Germany and German language

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s:s
D :  if they were pronouncing something in a certain way I could say , " Oh well that 's just the German way of pronouncing this "

dialogue type : s
D :  and then I figured out what they were saying .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I 've never taken Spanish ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  and even though I 've taken French , and I speak French fairly well , um , I found the Spanish to be much harder

dialogue type : s^df^rt
D :  and maybe also because the level of fluency for the Spanish speakers was a little bit less than the level of fluency of the German speakers that are here ?

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  I think

dialogue type : s
D :  There was a couple of different Spanish speakers .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Huh , that 's really interesting .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  I think so ,

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Yeah , he was hard .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  And you got to know his pronunciation of them .

dialogue type : s|s^bk
D :  I remember , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  Yeah , I remember that .

dialogue type : s
D :  And and m eh the way he said " mixed " was really strange , too .

dialogue type : s^e.%--
D :  " Miss - ed " or somethi

dialogue type : fh
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  Especially because also in the beginning meetings , I mean , he 'd say something and no one in the meeting would understand ,

dialogue type : s:qw^rt
D :  and then everyone would say , " What was that again ? "

dialogue type : s
D :  and then they 'd pronounce it in English

dialogue type : s
D :  and so I could figure out what it was

dialogue type : s^e
D :  that way .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  Like his English fluency got better ?

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Oh , I went crazy .

dialogue type : s
D :  I I would skip doing that portion for as long as I could

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because i I just couldn't deal with it ,

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  And they won't know .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I have no idea about Spain ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  but I know that in France for example Parisian French is much easier for me to understand

dialogue type : s^df
D :  cuz I learned it

dialogue type : s^e
D :  versus France in like Marseilles or in the south or in like the provin like the villages in the south ,

dialogue type : s
D :  it 's really hard to understand .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Much different .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : qy

D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  That 's really good .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  cuz that 's definitely something that I wouldn't have be able to do .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  There were problems even with , um , Am - English speakers though .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I mean , not in their level of fluency , obviously ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^e^rt
D :  Some people tend to mumble ,

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  and it 's hard to catch what it is

dialogue type : s^df
D :  is , cuz it goes by really quickly

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^na

dialogue type : s^na^r
D :  That too .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^no

dialogue type : s
D :  And some people tend to get interrupted more ,

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  Especially when they 're when you were using the l the mikes that weren't m headmounted mikes .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  And there was input from other people on the same channel as the person who was talking .

dialogue type : s
D :  And that was really hard to deal with .

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s.%--

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : %--
D :  And f

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  And it was very hard to be precise about it ,

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  I had so much trouble at the very beginning trying to figure out who was who .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Cuz there 's m so many men and so few women .

dialogue type : s
D :  The women were easy to f figure out who was who ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and then the men all their voices sounded the same

dialogue type : s^e
D :  except I think there was one British English speaker

dialogue type : s
D :  and that was easy

dialogue type : fh
D :  but

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Eh . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  An easier time ?

dialogue type : s^na
D :  That 's possible .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  It 's interesting .

dialogue type : fh
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , but it definitely got much better when that change happened .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  That took a l

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  E No . It just took time . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Me too ,

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Yeah , that happens a lot .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Then to have it be cut off .

dialogue type : s.%-

dialogue type : s^2

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : qr^bu^d
D :  Of breath or of uh nothing ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  With fricatives a lot .

dialogue type : s
D :  Although I found one in actually I was just working right before this meeting , one where someone said , " great "

dialogue type : fh
D :  and

dialogue type : s
D :  the the G it was pronounced as a K

dialogue type : s^e
D :  so it was unvoiced

dialogue type : s
D :  and then part of the R was cut off in the beginning .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  And then

dialogue type : s
D :  you It sounded like " great "

dialogue type : s^e
D :  if you just listened to that time bin it still sounded like " great " .

dialogue type : s
D :  But if you listened to right before it you could hear a little the the K or whatever and a little bit of the R .

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : fh
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  usually that doesn't happen

dialogue type : s
D :  but this time it did .

dialogue type : s
D :  Or " sss " .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  But it 's not completely blocking the airflow .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s^aa
D :  Mmm , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Oh it does .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Completely .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I I don't remember the words exactly .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  It 's a shame .

dialogue type : s
D :  There was one that was a whole sentence was broken up in the middle , and there was a little like millisecond of break in the middle .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And

dialogue type : s
D :  if you connected it all together , it completely changed what was right before it and what was right after it .

dialogue type : s
D :  It was written as something else ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and then it became a word together from what was before and after

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and then with this little tiny millisecond pause .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So I guess I don't know . I mean , I guess when we talk in between different segments of the word maybe , there 's pauses somehow ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
D :  or something like that .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's probably like inaudible for us

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  And maybe the pause was just so short that it made up a pause .

dialogue type : s
D :  I don't is it That doesn't make any sense ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  but .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  On purpose , though .

dialogue type : s
D :  Or not .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah , that is true .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  How it was really pronounced ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  I always get confused with the pronunciation convention .

dialogue type : s^r
D :  I get confused with pronunciation , like when there 's a strange pronunciation that I wanna mark .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  Because I think w

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
D :  m may di in the beginning did we do the strange pronunciation and then write PRN and what it really was meant to be ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
D :  And now we 're doing the normal word and then inside the brackets what it sounded like ?

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
D :  We did a switch , right ?

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Or not .

dialogue type : s^no.%-
D :  I don't know if it 's just me that 's confused or if it was swi

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bs
D :  So the convention as it stands now is write the word as it is normally conventionally spelled in English with the little apostrophe , or whatever you call it ,

dialogue type : s^bs
D :  and then " PRN " ,

dialogue type : s
D :  how it 's pronounced .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  He does it a lot .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : b

D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  There 's a study done on when people say " uh " and when people say " um " .

dialogue type : s
D :  Also , there 's contec in concet contextual variation ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and it 's predictable apparently ,

dialogue type : s^df.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  It 's really interesting .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  You know , what 's On that sort of similar topic , I just thought of something that 's been hard for me sometimes , is you can have a pronunciation of of the word " a " as " a " .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then you can have " uh " like a pause or whatever as " uh " ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and sometimes it 's hard to tell what the person meant .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Are did they mean " uh " like they 're pausing

dialogue type : qrr
D :  or did they mean " a " like " a person " ?

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
D :  And

dialogue type : s
D :  you can kind of tell from the context

dialogue type : s^df

D :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^na
D :  relatively rare .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean I can only think of like two or three occasions where I sat and thought about it for a while .

dialogue type : s
D :  Other times just you figure you look at it and what 's the context .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's OK ,

dialogue type : s^no

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : qy^rt

dialogue type : s^cs

dialogue type : s^df^rt
D :  and they don't tend to say as much ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
D :  um , m backchannels or whatever .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I remember transcribing one person ,

dialogue type : s
D :  all they did was clear their throat and breathe .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then read digits

dialogue type : s
D :  and then it was like the end of the meeting .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  But then there are some people who are Even if they 're not actually speaking , you can tell they 're more involved or interested or something ,

dialogue type : s^df:s^bk
D :  cuz they 're always , " Mm - hmm , oh yeah , really , mm - hmm " Um , reacting . Yeah .

D :  Nn - mm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  She always tends to get interrupted .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's really makes it a lot nicer to transcribe

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because there can be a lot of heated discussions about these very technical issues

dialogue type : s^df
D :  and people will have their opinions

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's really nice to have a little bit of humor ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  a little bit of break away from that

dialogue type : s^df:qy
D :  because it 's hard to sit there and li see like , " But , don't you see h you 're being rude to this person , you 're cutting off this person

dialogue type : s:s
D :  and it 's not nice ? "

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

D : 

dialogue type : b

D :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh .

D :  That 's OK .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  It 's OK .

dialogue type : s^cs^tc
D :  I had something that I could bring up .

dialogue type : h
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  as far as ideas about looking at the data and getting ideas about whatever you said hypotheses about how to figure it out .

dialogue type : s
D :  One thing that I I 'm you probably don't remember this that I was really interested in is the use of " so " and the use of " or " .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know if it was it if it 's different than other people .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know if it 's a computer speech thing .

dialogue type : s^bsc
D :  I mean , computer people speech thing ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  but um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  people tend to end utterances quite often with " so " or " or " and trailing off .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I found that really interesting ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I was curious to to figure out when that happened ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  if it happened in certain occasions and whatever ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I never really got around to it ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  but .

dialogue type : s^ng.%--
D :  It didn't sound stran

dialogue type : s^ng^rt
D :  I mean , it doesn't sound like bizarre enough that I don't understand .

dialogue type : s
D :  But I don't think it 's something that happens in just everyday speech really .

dialogue type : qy^bh
D :  Really ?

dialogue type : qy^bh
D :  Really ?

dialogue type : qy^bh
D :  Huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  Like that you 're flexible ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , " so " tends to happen when the person brings up a new idea that kind of goes against what the other people is saying .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Or at least that 's what I found .

dialogue type : s
D :  Like if someone in a meeting is talking about a certain thing and someone kind of interrupts or doesn't necessarily interrupt and says something either a new topic or a different take on the same topic will tend to use will trail off with " so " .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  kind of ,

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  And " or " tends to be used with questions more than So .

dialogue type : %
D :  But .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  I thought that was really interesting .

dialogue type : s
D :  When you end the utterance .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'd definitely like to look more at that if I can ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  but .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  " But I 'm not really sure

dialogue type : s:s^cs
D :  so you can you could finish my thought . "

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  It 's a different kind of shrug though .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think it shows less of confident like less confidence in what they just said

dialogue type : s^e
D :  in a way .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  More similar than to " so " I think .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd^rt
D :  Or maybe it 's just a link to get back to the conversation or something ?

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Like to connect it with what is going on elsewhere ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
D :  Oh , like kind of kind of laughing with it

dialogue type : s^bu^e
D :  in a way ?

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^am
D :  Maybe it means that .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
D :  Maybe if maybe it 's when people don't laugh enough or something .

dialogue type : fh
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  I don't know about permission .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  To keep going with the meeting .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Cuz sometimes you can get on digressions that just last for like minutes at a time .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  And people are just hysterical

dialogue type : s^e:qw
D :  and they 're like , " What were we talking about ?

dialogue type : s^e:s^no
D :  I don't know " .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  It 's hard when people get really really in like into their laughing and start talking at the same time .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  It 's hard to figure out what they 're doi what they 're talking about ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
D :  and also they don't tend to talk very f

dialogue type : s^df
D :  there 's a lot of disfluencies when they 're laughing and talking .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  " Oh , but I don't mean the transcribers we have here of course . "

dialogue type : s^na
D :  That 's what I thought too .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  But in the transcriptions I mean , we don't have to deal with that

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because when the other interface deals with it then they break it up or whatever .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
D :  Are we gonna do them together then ?

dialogue type : qrr
D :  Or no ?

dialogue type : s^na
