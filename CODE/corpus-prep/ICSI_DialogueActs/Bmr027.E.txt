dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  I 'm not as diligent as Chuck ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but I had the feeling I should probably respond

dialogue type : s:s
E :  and tell Adam , like , " I got this and I will do it by this date ,

dialogue type : s^cs:s
E :  and if you don't hear from me by then " You know , in other words responding to your email once , right away , saying " as soon as you get this could you please respond . "

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
E :  And then if you if the person thinks they 'll need more time because they 're out of town or whatever , they can tell you at that point ?

E :  Or they they might never have gotten the email ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because although they signed this , they don't know by which date to expect your email .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  in internally we know that people are there ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but we have no confirmation that they got the mail .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  It we 're hoping that doesn't happen ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but that 's why there 's such a thing as registered mail

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  You 'll either wonder at the beginning or you 'll wonder at the end .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  I It 's pretty much the same am amount of work

dialogue type : s
E :  except for an additional email just saying they got the email .

dialogue type : s^am^cs.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^2
E :  Or the date at which they would be receiving the email from you .

dialogue type : s
E :  They probably forgot all about it .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
E :  That 's why you never open these things that come in the mail .

dialogue type : s
E :  The other thing that there 's a psychological effect that at least for most people , that if they 've responded to your email saying " yes , I will do it " or " yes , I got your email " , they 're more likely to actually do it later than to just ignore it .

dialogue type : s
E :  And of course we don't want them to bleep things out ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but it it 's a little bit better if we 're getting the their , uh , final response , once they 've answered you once than if they never answer you 'd at al at all .

dialogue type : s
E :  That 's how these mailing houses work .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , I mean , it 's not completely lost work

dialogue type : s
E :  because it might benefit us in terms of getting responses .

dialogue type : s
E :  You know , an official OK from somebody is better than no answer , even if they responded that they got your email .

dialogue type : s
E :  And they 're probably more likely to do that once they 've responded that they got the email .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  Then they just come back .

dialogue type : s
E :  Same as us .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
E :  Right . That would that would definitely work on me .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  You know , it makes you feel m like ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  if you were gonna p if you 're predicting that you might not answer , you have a chance now to say that .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  Whereas , I I mean , I would be much more likely myself ,

dialogue type : s:s
E :  given all my email , t to respond at that point , saying " you know what , I 'm probably not gonna get to it " or whatever ,

dialogue type : s
E :  rather than just having seen the email , thinking I might get to it ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and never really , uh , pushing myself to actually do it until it 's too late .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right . R Right . That 's true .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah . That 's true .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
E :  Yeah . You have to do all of them ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  as well as all of these .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  You have to do all You could just do it in that time period , though ,

dialogue type : s^bd
E :  but I guess it 's a pain .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
E :  Yeah . You 're right .

dialogue type : s^cs^j^t3
E :  Then someday we can sell the unedited versions .

dialogue type : s^aa^j^t3
E :  Right . Exactly . I see .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  See , this is good .

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  I wanted to create some side conversations in these meetings .

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba^df
E :  Cuz we don't have enough asides .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--

dialogue type : s^ba^j
E :  H - good old HMM .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
E :  No , it 's backward - forward .

dialogue type : %-

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs

dialogue type : s^r^tc
E :  Anyway , quick question .

dialogue type : qw.%-
E :  How m

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  Like , there were three meetings this time , or so

dialogue type : qw
E :  or how many ?

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
E :  Six ?

dialogue type : s
E :  But , no of different people .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  So I guess if you 're in both these types of meetings , you 'd have a lot .

dialogue type : qw.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Like , if we release this time it 's a fairly small number of meetings ,

dialogue type : qh^cs
E :  but what if we release , like , twenty - five meetings to people ?

dialogue type : %-
E :  In th

dialogue type : s^bd^no
E :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh . Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s|s^bk
E :  So this time was just the first chunk . OK .

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt.%--
E :  Wait . So you put the reference files ?

dialogue type : qrr.%-

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  Well , we can talk about it off - line .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  I think they 're doing w

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
E :  didn't they want to do language modeling on , you know , recognition - compatible transcripts

dialogue type : qrr.%--
E :  or ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  We should order a cou uh , t two or three or four , actually .

E : 

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  Sh - Just get the model number

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : qw^rt

E :  Like ?

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  You just b go and b

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 'd be a good idea .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 's a great ambiguity .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  it 's it 's social

dialogue type : s^e
E :  and , uh , discourse level

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s^fa
E :  Sorry .

dialogue type : s:s
E :  See , if I had that little scratch - pad , I would have made an X there .

dialogue type : s
E :  It was while I was out of town .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
E :  I think we need , like , another eighteen gig disk to be safe .

dialogue type : %-
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : %-
E :  Uh , i

dialogue type : qw
E :  Do when when is this planned for roughly ?

E :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Good .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , each meeting is like a gig or something ,

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : qw
E :  How long does it take you to save the data ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  Guess we should stop , like , twenty of at the latest .

dialogue type : s
E :  We we have another meeting coming in that they wanna record .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  It 's up to you .

E :  Wait . Why is everybody looking at me ?

dialogue type : h|s^no
E :  Uh . I 'm not sure what you were referring to .

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
E : 

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  You know , before we were working with these segments that were all synchronous

dialogue type : s
E :  and that caused a lot of problems

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because you have timed sp at on either side .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  And so that 's sort of a

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  stage - two of trying the same kinds of alignments with the tighter boundaries with them is really the next step .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  I guess , good news .

dialogue type : s
E :  We got our abstract accepted for this conference ,

dialogue type : fh|s^bsc
E :  um workshop ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  ISCA workshop , in , um , uh , New Jersey .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  And we sent in a very poor abstract ,

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  very poor ,

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  very quick .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but we 're hoping to have a paper for that as well ,

dialogue type : s^ba.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  The t paper isn't due until August .

dialogue type : s
E :  The abstracts were already due .

dialogue type : s
E :  So it 's that kind of workshop .

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  sort of a different crowd ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  and I think we 're the only people working on prosody in meetings so far ,

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  so that should be interesting .

dialogue type : h|s
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  Uh , so it 's focused on using prosody in automatic systems

dialogue type : s
E :  and there 's a um , a web page for it .
