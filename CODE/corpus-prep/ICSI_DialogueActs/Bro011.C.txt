dialogue type : z
C :  Uh - oh .

dialogue type : z
C :  Radio four .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Alright .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
C :  Well . Uh first we discussed about some of the points that I was addressing in the mail I sent last week .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  About the um , well the downsampling problem .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh and about the f the length of the filters

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  So the fact that there there is no uh low - pass filtering before the downsampling .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Well .

dialogue type : s
C :  There is because there is LDA filtering but that 's perhaps not uh the best

dialogue type : %--
C :  w m

dialogue type : fh
C :  Well .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : h|s^co^na^rt
C :  Uh " try it " .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I guess .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  We don't have yet

dialogue type : fh
C :  um So , yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
C :  We should have a look first at , perhaps , the modulation spectrum .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C :  Um . So there is this ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  there is the um length of the filters .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um . So the i this idea of trying to find filters with shorter delays .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
C :  Um . We started to work with this .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^t.%--
C :  And the third point um was the um ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C :  yeah , the on - line normalization where ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  well , the recursion f recursion for the mean estimation is a filter with some kind of delay

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  and that 's not taken into account right now .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um . Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  And there again , yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  For this , the conclusion of Hynek was , well , " we can try it but "

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : h|s
C :  So try to um um take into account the delay of the recursion for the mean estimation .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  And this we 've not uh worked on this yet .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um , yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And so while discussing about these these LDA filters , some i issues appeared , like

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  well , the fact that if we look at the frequency response of these filters it 's

dialogue type : s
C :  uh , well , we don't know really what 's the important part in the frequency response

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  and there is the fact that in the very low frequency , these filters don't don't really remove a lot . compared to the to the uh standard RASTA filter .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C :  Uh and that 's probably a reason why , yeah , on - line normalization helps because it it ,

dialogue type : s
C :  yeah , it removed this mean .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
C :  Um . Yeah , but perhaps everything could should be could be in the filter ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s^tc
C :  So basically that was that 's all we discussed about .

dialogue type : s^t
C :  We discussed about good things to do

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  also uh well , generally good stuff to do for the research .

dialogue type : s
C :  And this was this LDA uh tuning perhaps and Hynek proposed again to his uh TRAPS ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b
C :  um .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Well , but .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah

dialogue type : s^no.%--
C :  I don't know what happened really , but

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  I guess it 's it 's also so uh the time constraints .

dialogue type : s
C :  Because , well , we discussed about that about this problem

dialogue type : fh|s.x
C :  and they told us " well , we will do all that 's possible to have enough space for a network "

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  but then , yeah , perhaps they were too short with the time and

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  uh yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  But there was also problem perhaps a problem of communication .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , yeah .

dialogue type : s^cc.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs.x
C :  Yeah , slikes and send mails .

dialogue type : fh
C :  u s

dialogue type : b
C :  o o Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Basically .

dialogue type : b
C :  Um .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  So yeah we 're will start to do this also .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
C :  Uh so Carmen is just looking at the Ericsson Ericsson code .

dialogue type : %-
C :  And

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Oh yeah ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^rt.%-
C : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Is it the guy that was using the pattern of pressure on the tongue

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  or ?

dialogue type : qw.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  I guess we can try to have some kind of new baseline for next week perhaps .

dialogue type : s^e^rt
C :  with all these minor things modified .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then do other things ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  play with the spectral subtraction ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  and retry the MSG and things like that .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  Big list ?

dialogue type : qw^rt.x
C :  What is Octave so ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  It 's a free software ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
C :  And it does the same syntax and everything

dialogue type : z
C :  eh

dialogue type : z
C :  like Matlab , or ?
