dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah , I think so too .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s
E :  The we got to the point where we can now speak into the SmartKom system , and it 'll go all the way through and then say something like " Roman numeral one , am Smarticus . "

dialogue type : s
E :  It actually says , " Roemisch einz , am Smarticus , "

dialogue type : s
E :  which means it 's just using a German sythesis module for English sentences .

dialogue type : %-
E :  So uh ,

dialogue type : fh|%-
E :  Um , the uh

dialogue type : sj
E :  The uh sythesis is just a question of um , hopefully it 's just a question of exchanging a couple of files , once we have them .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  And , um , it 's not going to be a problem because we decided to stick to the so - called concept to speech approach .

dialogue type : s
E :  So I 'm I 'm I 'm going backwards now ,

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  so " synthesis " is where you sort of make this uh , make these sounds ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and " concept to speech " is feeding into this synthesis module giving it what needs to be said , and the whole syntactic structure

dialogue type : s^df
E :  so it can pronounce things better , presumably . Then , just with text to speech .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  And , uh , Johno learned how to write XML tags .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Uh , and did write the tree adjoining grammar for some some sentences .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
E :  No ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  But I think that the point is that out of the twelve possible utterances that the German system can do , we 've already written the the syntax trees for three or four .

dialogue type : s
E :  And because we 're sticking to that structure , the synthesis module doesn't need to be changed . So all that f fancy stuff ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and the Texas speech version of it , which is actually the simpler version , is gonna be done in October which is much too late for us .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  This way we we worked around that .

dialogue type : s^cc
E :  The , uh the system , um I can show you the system .

dialogue type : s
E :  I actually want , at least , maybe , you should be able to start it on your own . If you wanna play around with it , in th in the future .

dialogue type : s
E :  Right now it 's brittle and you need to ch start it up and then make ts twenty changes on on on on seventeen modules before they actually can stomach it , anything .

dialogue type : s
E :  And send in a a a couple of side queries on some dummy center set - up program so that it actually works

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because it 's designed for this seevit thing , where

dialogue type : s
E :  And so we 're doing it via mouse ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but the whole system was designed to work with this thing

dialogue type : s
E :  and it was It was a lot of engineering stuff .

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  No science in there whatsoever ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but it 's working now ,

dialogue type : fh|sj
E :  and um , that 's the good news .

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  So everything else actually did prove to be language independent except for the parsing and the generation .

dialogue type : s^t3
E :  You have to switch it on .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  No .

dialogue type : b.x
E :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  It 's got .

dialogue type : s
E :  What I what I think is is a good idea that I can can show to anyone who 's interested ,

dialogue type : s
E :  we can even make a sort of an internal demo ,

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  and I I show you what I do ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I speak into it and you hear it talk ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and I can sort of walk f through the information .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , this is like in half hour or forty - five minutes .

dialogue type : s
E :  Just fun .

dialogue type : s
E :  And so you when somebody on the streets com comes up to you and asks you what is SmartKom so you can , sort of , give a sensible answer .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aap.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt^tc
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s
E :  Makes sense .

dialogue type : h|sj
E :  Um . Well it was just amazing to to see uh how how instable the whole thing is ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : sj
E :  And I g I got the feeling that we are the only ones right now who have a running system .

dialogue type : s^no
E :  I don't know what the guys in Kaiserslautern have running

dialogue type : %--
E :  because

dialogue type : s
E :  e the version that is , the full version that 's on the server d does not work .

dialogue type : s
E :  And you need to do a lot of stuff to make it work .

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  And even Tilman and Ralf sort of said " yeah there never was a really working version that uh did it without th all the shortcuts that they built in for the uh October @ @ version " .

dialogue type : sj
E :  So we 're actually maybe ahead of the System Gruppe by now ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  the system the integration group .

dialogue type : sj
E :  And it was , uh It was fun to some extent ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
E :  um , I know that they enjoyed it here ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and they r they they liked , uh , a lot of the stuff they saw here ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
E :  what what we have been thinking about ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and they 're more than willing to to um , cooperate , by all means .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  And um , part of my responsibility is uh to use our internal " group - ware " server at EML ,

dialogue type : s
E :  make that open to all of us and them ,

dialogue type : s
E :  so that whatever we discuss in terms of parsing and and generating and constructions w we we sort of uh put it in there

dialogue type : s
E :  and they put what they do in there

dialogue type : s.x
E :  and maybe we can even um , get some overlap , get some synergy out of that .

dialogue type : fh
E :  And um ,

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  If I find someone at in EML that is interested in that , um I I may even think that we could look take constructions and and generate from them

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because the tree adjoining grammars that that Tilman is using is as you said nothing but a mathematical formalism .

dialogue type : s
E :  And you can just do anything with it , whether it 's syntactic trees , H P S G - like stuff , or whether it 's construction .

dialogue type : s
E :  So if you ever get to the generation side of constructing things and there might be something of interest there ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but in the moment we 're of course definitely focused on the understanding , um , pipeline .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fh|s^bsc
E :  Um . Well , no , we didn't decide .

dialogue type : s
E :  We wanted to look into maybe getting it , the visualization , a bit clearer ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but I think if we do it , um , sort of a paper version of all the nodes and then the connections between them , that should suffice .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  I I also s would suggest not to d spend two weeks in in in changing the the JavaBayes code .

dialogue type : s^cc
E :  I I will send you a pointer to a Java applet that does that ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  it 's sort of a fish - eye .

dialogue type : s^e^rt
E :  You you have a node , and you click on it , and it shows you all the connections ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and then if you click on something else that moves away , that goes into the middle .

dialogue type : s^am
E :  And maybe there is an easy way of interfacing those two .

dialogue type : s
E :  If that doesn't work , it 's not a problem we we need to solve right now .

dialogue type : s^cc
E :  What I 'm what my job is , I will , um , give you the input in terms of of the internal structure .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
E :  Maybe node by node , or something like this ?

dialogue type : qrr
E :  Or should I collect it all

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk.%
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|qy^bu^d^rt
E :  And um you 're gonna be around ? t again , always Tuesdays and Thursdays afternoon - ish ? As usual ?

dialogue type : qr^rt
E :  Or will that change ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa|%--
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
E :  OK .

dialogue type : sj^ba
E :  No , that 's good .

dialogue type : s
E :  That means I have I h I can spend this week doing it .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  Fo - Hopefully as time passes we 'll get more and more data from Heidelberg and from people actually using it and stuff .

dialogue type : s
E :  So but this is the long run .

dialogue type : sj
E :  But to solve our problems ag uh a mediocre design will do I think in the beginning .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  The German .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  Oh yeah , of course , German .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : sj^ba
E :  That 's important , yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
E :  We probably will not get those to describe because they were trial runs .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um , but uh that 's th but we have data in English and German already .

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Transcribed .

dialogue type : s^cc
E :  I will send you that .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : qw^t
E :  Ho - how was your thingy .

dialogue type : h|s
E :  Um . The uh Well I wa I was on a uh on a on a different sidetrack .

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , the the Deep Map project which um is undergoing some renovation at at the moment ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but this is a a three language project : German , English , Japanese .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  And um , we have a uh , uh I have taken care that we have the the Japanese generation and stuff .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  And so I looked into uh spatial description .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  So we can generate spatial descriptions , how to get from A to B . And and information on objects , in German , English , and Japanese .

dialogue type : s
E :  And there is a huge uh project on spatial descriptions uh differences in spatial descriptions .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Well , if yo if you 're interested in that ,

dialogue type : qw.%--
E :  so how how ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean it does sort of go d all the way down to the conceptual level to some extent .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's KLEIST .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's the uh Bielefeld generation of uh spatial descriptions and whatever .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
E :  But um , I I think we should leave Japanese constructions maybe outside of the scope for for now ,

dialogue type : fh|sj^ba
E :  but um definitely it 's interesting to look at at cross the bordered there .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
E :  Intrinsic ,

dialogue type : b
E :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt
E :  Um . Did you ever get to look at the the rou paper that I sent you on the on that problem in English and German ?

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Carroll , ninety - three .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um . I There is a a study on the differences between English and German on exactly that problem .

dialogue type : s:s
E :  So it 's they actually say " the monkey in front of the car ,

dialogue type : qw^rt
E :  where 's the monkey ? "

dialogue type : s
E :  And , um , they found statistically very significant differences in English and German ,

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : sj
E :  It might be , since there are only a finite number of ways of doing it , that that German might be more like Hebrew in that respect .

dialogue type : s
E :  The solution they proposed was that it was due to syntactic factors .

dialogue type : s
E :  That syntactic facto factors do do play a role there , wh whether you 're more likely , you know , to develop uh , choices that lead you towards using uh intrinsic versus extrinsic reference frames .

dialogue type : s^cc
E :  I can also give you uh , a pointer to a paper of mine which is the the ultimate taxonomy of reference frames .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : s
E :  I 'm the only person in the world who actually knows how it works .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Not really .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's it 's spatial reference frames .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : h|s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  I should there should be an " L " , though .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well actually you have only have two choices .

dialogue type : s
E :  You can either do a two - point or a three - point

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  which is you You 're familiar with th with the " origo " ?

dialogue type : s
E :  where that 's the center " Origo " is the center of the f frame of reference .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then you have the reference object and the object to be localized .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
E :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
E :  In some cases the origo is the same as the reference object .

dialogue type : s
E :  " Origo " is a Terminus technikus . in that sense ,

dialogue type : s
E :  that 's even used in the English literature .

dialogue type : s
E :  " Origo . "

dialogue type : fh
E :  And um , so ,

dialogue type : s
E :  this video tape is in front of me .

dialogue type : s
E :  I 'm the origo and I 'm also the reference object .

dialogue type : s
E :  Those are two - point .

dialogue type : s
E :  And three - point relations is if something has an intrinsic front side like this chair then your f shoe is behind the chair .

dialogue type : s
E :  And , reference object and Um . No , from from my point of view your shoe is left of the chair .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
E :  So ,

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  On this scale , you have it either be ego or allocentric .

dialogue type : s
E :  And that 's that 's basically it .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  So . Egocentric two - point , egocentric three - point , or you can have allocentric .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  So , " as seen from the church , the town hall is right of that um , fire station " .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
E :  aa - huh It 's hardly ever used but it 's w

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Yeah

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's also all on my my home page at EML .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's called " An Anatomy of a Spatial Description " .

dialogue type : s^cc
E :  But I 'll send that link .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
E :  This is more proximal - distal .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  Well , Dan Montello sort of ,

dialogue type : s
E :  he he does the uh uh th the cognitive map world , down in Santa Barbara .

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  i probably most likely without knowing this this evidence uh is talking about these small scale spaces that you can manipulate versus large scale environmental spaces .

dialogue type : s^j
E :  The - th There there 's a drive - in thesis uh sh joint over in Saarbruecken .

dialogue type : s
E :  Document .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fh|sj
E :  Uh . I I think the one you you gave here a couple of weeks ago would be of interest there , too .

dialogue type : %-
E :  I I tho

dialogue type : sj
E :  It 's probably better if I come next week with the um version O point nine of the structure .

dialogue type : fh|qy^bu^d^rt
E :  And um , the the sem semester will be over next week but then you have projects for one more week to come ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
E :  Same with you ?

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mmm .
