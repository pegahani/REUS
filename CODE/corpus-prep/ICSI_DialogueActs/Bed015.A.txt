dialogue type : z
A :  OK , we 're recording .

dialogue type : qw
A :  Well , you know what ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  If you have an " if - then " phrase , do you know what the " then " phrase is called ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar|%-
A :  No , but

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No !

dialogue type : s
A :  Just , uh , as a sort of a mental bridge , I 'm not I 'm skipping fourth of July .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , uh , right afterwards I 'm back .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
A :  Uh , I 've had it often enough .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Do you want to do the same for space ?

dialogue type : s^r
A :  Space ?

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Here ?

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Now ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm ,

dialogue type : s:s
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  you know , where where it 's contextually dependent ,

dialogue type : qh
A :  " what is now ,

dialogue type : qh
A :  what was past ,

dialogue type : qh
A :  what is in the future ,

dialogue type : qh
A :  where is this ,

dialogue type : qh
A :  what is here ,

dialogue type : qh
A :  what is there ,

dialogue type : qh.%--
A :  what is "

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  I can say two things about the f

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Maybe you want to forget stress .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  This my f

dialogue type : s^ar|s^cs
A :  No , as as Just don't don't think about it .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  canonically speaking you can if you look at a a curve over sentence , you can find out where a certain stress is

dialogue type : s
A :  and say , " hey , that 's my focus exponent . "

dialogue type : s
A :  It doesn't tell you anything what the focus is .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  If it 's just that thing ,

dialogue type : s
A :  a little bit more or the whole phrase .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^na
A :  The form bit

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because , uh , as a form cue , um , not even trained experts can always well , they can tell you where the focus exponent is sometimes .

dialogue type : s
A :  And that 's also mostly true for read speech .

dialogue type : s
A :  In in real speech , um , people may put stress .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's so d context dependent on what was there before , phrase ba breaks , um , restarts .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  it 's absurd .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  It 's complicated .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  Or or map from the contour to to what the focus exponent is .

dialogue type : s
A :  But , uh , if you don't know what you 're what you 're focus is then you 're you 're hopeless - uh - ly lost anyways ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and the only way of figuring out what that is , is , um , by sort of generating all the possible alternatives to each focused element , decide which one in that context makes sense and which one doesn't .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then you 're left with a couple three .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , you know , again , that 's something that h humans can do ,

dialogue type : s
A :  um , but far outside the scope of of any anything .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : fh
A :  You know .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A :  u u

dialogue type : s
A :  But it 's it 's what it uh , it 's pretty easy to put it in the formalism , though .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
A :  I mean , because

dialogue type : s
A :  you can just say whatever stuff , " i is the container being focused or the the entire whatever , both , and so forth . "

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  So we talked about that a little bit this morning .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  " John is on the bus ,

dialogue type : s:s
A :  not Nancy . "

dialogue type : s
A :  So that 's focuses on John .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  " John is on the bus and not on the train . "

dialogue type : s:s
A :  " John is on the bus " versus " John is on the train . "

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  And " John is on the bus " versus " was " , and e

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  " it 's the bu " so e

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  All of these

dialogue type : qy.%--
A :  and will we have u

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  is it all the same constructions ?

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Just with a different foc focus constituent ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So

dialogue type : s^aa|s
A :  Yeah , well the once you know what the focus is the everything else is background .

dialogue type : qh
A :  How about " topic - comment "

dialogue type : s
A :  that 's the other side of information .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  Topic - comment .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Mm - hmm , hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  But to make it m precise at least in my mind , uh , it 's not precise .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  So " house " is gender neuter ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  In reality

dialogue type : qrr.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk^m
A :  semantically .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s
A :  No , just to make sure that we everybody that 's completely agreed that it it has nothing to do with , uh , form .

dialogue type : s
A :  Then " predications " makes sense to to have it open for something like , uh , accessibility or not .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy
A :  Uh , i i i is there any meaning to when you have sort of parameters behind it and when you don't ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , just just , uh , look read uh even sem semi formal Mats Rooth .

dialogue type : s
A :  If you haven't read it . It 's nice .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  And just pick any paper on alternative semantics .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that 's his that 's the best way of talking about focus , is I think his way .

dialogue type : s
A :  Mats .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  MATS .

dialogue type : s
A :  Rooth .

dialogue type : s
A :  I think two O 's ,

dialogue type : s^aa|s
A :  yes , TH .

dialogue type : s
A :  I never know how to pronounce his name

dialogue type : s^df.%-
A :  because he 's sort of ,

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , he is Dutch

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  and , um but very confused background I think .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So and , um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  And sadly enough he also just left the IMS in Stuttgart .

dialogue type : s
A :  So he 's not there anymore .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know where he is right now

dialogue type : s
A :  but alternative semantics is if you type that into an , uh , uh , browser or search engine you 'll get tons of stuff .

dialogue type : s^tc
A :  And what I 'm kind of confused about is is what the speaker and the hearer is is sort of doing there .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy
A :  Yeah , but you Don't we ultimately want to handle that analogously to the way we handle time and place ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because " you " , " me " , " he " , " they " ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  you know , " these guys " ,

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Ah !

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  That 's up at the reference part .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  And down there in the speaker - hearer part ?

dialogue type : s:s
A :  You know , uh , uh , it 's the speaker may in English is allowed to say " I . "

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Uh , among the twenty - five percent most used words .

dialogue type : qh
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  that happens to be the speaker this time

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and not " they , " whoever they are .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  much like the " you " could n

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  Well , not not always .

dialogue type : s.%-:s.%-
A :  I mean , so there 's " and then he said , I w " Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Twhhh - whhh .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  And I 'm sure gonna read the transcript of this one .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  But the , uh , But it 's too bad that we don't have a camera .

dialogue type : s^df^e
A :  You know , all the pointing is gonna be lost .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba|s^tc
A :  Mmm , isn't I mean , I 'm I was sort of dubious why why he even introduces this sort of reality , you know , as your basic mental space

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df:s
A :  d doesn't start with some because it 's so obvi it should be so obvious , at least it is to me , that whenever I say something I could preface that with " I think . "

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  Nuh ?

dialogue type : s
A :  So there should be no categorical difference between your base and all the others that ensue .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
A :  Yeah , it 's Absolutely .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah , but about linguistic hedges ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , those those tend to be , um , funky anyways

dialogue type : s^df.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^tc:s
A :  Uh great word in the English language is called " about " .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  " about . "

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  clever .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : qy
A :  i isn't that part easy though

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because in terms of the s simspec , it would just mean you put one more set of brack brackets around it ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and then just tell it to sort of negate whatever the content of that is in terms of irony

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Well , I also think the detailed discussion will hit you know , bring us to problems that are of a general nature

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  even suggest some solutions .

dialogue type : b.%
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  We have a little bit of news , uh , just minor stuff .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : qw^br
A :  Huh ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bd
A :  Oh , just small stuff .

dialogue type : fh|s^ft.%--
A :  Um , thanks to Eva on our web site we can now ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  if you want to run JavaBayes , uh , you could see get download these classes .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  she modified the GUI so it has now a m a m a button menu item for saving it into the embedded JavaBayes format .

dialogue type : s^ba^rt
A :  So that 's wonderful .

dialogue type : s
A :  And , um and she , a You tested it out .

dialogue type : qy
A :  Do you want to say something about that , that it works , right ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
A :  OK , that 's that 's a bit unfortunate

dialogue type : fh
A :  but

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Well that 's probably maybe in the long term that 's good news

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because it forces us to think a little bit more carefully how how we want to get an out output .

dialogue type : s
A :  Um , but that 's a different discussion for a different time .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
A :  We 're really running late ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so I had , uh , an idea yesterday

dialogue type : s^no
A :  but , uh , I don't know whether we should even start discussing .

dialogue type : h|s
A :  Um , the construal bit that , um , has been pointed to but hasn't been , um , made precise by any means , um , may w may work as follows .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  that the following thing would be in incredibly nice

dialogue type : s^df
A :  and I have no clue whether it will work at all or nothing .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that 's just a tangent , a couple of mental disclaimers here .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , imagine you you write a Bayes - net ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  Bayes - net ,

dialogue type : s
A :  um , completely from scratch every time you do construal .

dialogue type : s
A :  So you have nothing .

dialogue type : s
A :  Just a white piece of paper .

dialogue type : s
A :  You consult consult your ontology

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  which will tell you a bunch of stuff , and parts , and properties , uh - uh - uh

dialogue type : s
A :  then y you 'd simply write , uh , these into onto your your white piece of paper .

dialogue type : s
A :  And you will get a lot of notes and stuff out of there .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  You won't get you won't really get any C P

dialogue type : s
A :  T 's , therefore we need everything that that configures to what the situation is ,

dialogue type : s
A :  IE , the context dependent stuff .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  So you get whatever comes from discourse

dialogue type : s
A :  but also filtered .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  Uh , so only the ontology relevant stuff from the discourse

dialogue type : s
A :  plus the situation and the user model .

dialogue type : s
A :  And that fills in your CPT 's with which you can then query , um , the the net that you just wrote

dialogue type : s:s
A :  and find out how thing X is construed as an utterance U .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the embedded JavaBayes works exactly like that ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  we have , you know , precise format in which to write it ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so we write it down .

dialogue type : s
A :  You query it .

dialogue type : s
A :  You get the result ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and you throw it away .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the the nice thing about this idea is that you don't ever have to sit down and think about it or write about it .

dialogue type : s
A :  You may have some general rules as to how things can be can be construed as what , so that will allow you to craft the the the initial notes .

dialogue type : s
A :  But it 's in that respect it 's completely scalable .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Because it doesn't have any prior , um , configuration .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's just you need an ontology of the domain

dialogue type : s
A :  and you need the context dependent modules .

dialogue type : s
A :  And if this can be made to work at all , that 'd be kind of funky .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  P R Ms - uh , PRM

dialogue type : s^df
A : 

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Then you can .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm , yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^df
A :  No , I was m using it generic .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So , uh , probabilistic , whatever , relational models .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  Whatever you write it .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^2
A :  And then then instantiate them .

dialogue type : s^am
A :  That 's ma maybe the the way the only way it works .

dialogue type : %--
A :  But , uh ,

dialogue type : s^arp
A :  Except there 's no no theorem prover involved .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm , yeah .

dialogue type : %
A :  What 's it ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s^aap
A :  In the process thereof , or whatever .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  Fri - uh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  Thursday 's my last day here .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I would suggest as soon as possible .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Do you mean by we , the whole ben gang ?

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  We can do it Th - Thursday again .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Sure .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
A :  Thursday at one ?

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I can also maybe then sort of run through the , uh the talk I have to give at EML

dialogue type : s^cs^e
A :  which highlights all of our work .

dialogue type : s
A :  And we can make some last minute changes on that .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
A :  But we can do four .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  One or four .

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  I don't care .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  If it 's equal for all ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  What should we do ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  Four ?

dialogue type : s^df
A :  It 's equal to all of us ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so you can decide

dialogue type : s^e
A :  one or four .

dialogue type : s
A :  Liz actually said she likes four

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because it forces the Meeting Recorder people to cut , you know the discussions short .
