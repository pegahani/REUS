dialogue type : sj^ba

dialogue type : qy^rt

dialogue type : qrr.%--
A :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^na
A :  He generated , um , a channel - wise presegmented version of a meeting ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but it was Robustness rather than EDU so I guess depends on whether we 're willing to use Robustness ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Great .

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  I 'll I 'll I 'll , um , get make that available .

dialogue type : h
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah that 's right .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , we haven't done that .

dialogue type : s^cc

dialogue type : s^e
A :  And have them fix it over the entire meeting too ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Hmm , I gue hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^m^rt
A :  Individual channels .

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I guess there is this issue of , you know , if if the segmenter thought there was no speech on on a particular stretch , on a particular channel ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and there really was , then , if it didn't show up in a mixed signal to verify , then it might be overlooked ,

dialogue type : fh|qr
A :  so , I mean , the question is " should should a transcriber listen to the entire thing or can it g can it be based on the mixed signal ? "

dialogue type : s
A :  And I th eh so far as I 'm concerned it 's fine to base it on the mixed signal at this point ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  And that cuts down the time .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Yeah , that 's good .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Good , good , good .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  What what aspect ?

dialogue type : sj.x
A :  Should be pretty good ,

dialogue type : b
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah , but presumably , most of those they should be able to hear from the mixed signal unless they 're embedded in the heavil heavy overlap section

dialogue type : s
A :  when in which case they 'd be listening to the channels anyway .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  I am too .

dialogue type : s
A :  And I think it 's an empirical question .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah , that 's it .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^arp
A :  w Well , the other problem is the breaths

dialogue type : s^df
A :  cuz you also see the breaths on the waveform .

dialogue type : s
A :  I 've I 've looked at the int uh , s I 've tried to do that with a single channel ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and and you do see all sorts of other stuff besides just the voice .

dialogue type : sj^am
A :  Well that that I 'm not sure .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
A :  What you the digital what the digital task that you had your interface ?

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , I know for a fact that one of those sh she could really well she could judge what th what the number was based on the on the waveform .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , she could tell which one was seven .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Well , they have a choice .

dialogue type : s
A :  They could choose any signal to look at .

dialogue type : s
A :  I 've tried lookin but usually they look at the mixed .

dialogue type : s
A :  But I 've I 've tried looking at the single signal and and in order to judge when it when it was speech and when it wasn't ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but the problem is then you have breaths which which show up on the signal .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^fe
A :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s
A :  they show up on the separate ribbons .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  So you have a separate ribbon for each channel ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and and i i it 'll be because it 's being segmented as channel at a time with his with Thilo 's new procedure ,

dialogue type : s
A :  then you don't have the correspondence of the times across the bins uh across the ribbons

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^nd
A :  Oh , well not not " look " .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Not very quickly .

dialogue type : s
A :  You can but it takes time .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  That 's it .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , oh .

dialogue type : s
A :  Visually .

dialogue type : s
A :  You can you can switch quickly between the audio ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but you just can't get the visual display to show quickly .

dialogue type : s^co.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^r.%--
A :  It takes long enough cuz it has to reload the

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I I don't know exactly what it 's doing frankly

dialogue type : s
A :  cuz but it t it takes long enough that it 's just not a practical alternative .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Now you could set up multiple windows , each one with a different signal showing , and then look between the windows .

dialogue type : sj
A :  Maybe that 's the solution .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  You know , I am thinking if we have a meeting with only four speakers

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  and , you know , you could fire up a Transcriber interface for , y you know , in different windows , multiple ones , one for each channel .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  And it 's sort of a a hack but I mean it would be one way of seeing the visual form .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
A :  Well , I I do think that this this will be a doable procedure ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and have them starting with mixed

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  and , um , then when they get into overlaps , just have them systematically check all the channels to be sure that there isn't something hidden from from audio view .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa
A : 

dialogue type : s^fe
A :  oh , oh ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  get you can get the , uh you can get it to switch audio ?

dialogue type : h|s^nd
A :  Uh , not last I tried ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  but , um , maybe he 's changed it again .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  I disagree .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  There 's a reason I disagree , and that is that , uh , you it 's very good to have a dissociation between the visual and the audio .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  There 're times when I wanna hear the mixed signal ,

dialogue type : s
A :  bu but I want to transcribe on the single channel .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^fe

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  You did you have , uh , something in the report about , uh , about , uh , for f uh , forced alignment ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Have you have you started on that ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well it 's a merging problem .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I 've thought about this ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um , and I 've discussed I 've discussed it with Thilo ,

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
A :  um , the , I mean , I I in principle I could imagine writing a script which would approximate it to some degree ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but there is this problem of slippage ,

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well they they can be stretched .

dialogue type : sj^ng
A :  I wouldn't make that generalization

dialogue type : s^df
A :  cuz sometimes people will say , " And then I " and there 's a long pause

dialogue type : s
A :  and finish the sentence

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : sj
A :  I mean it 's it 's not a simple problem .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  And then it 's coupled with the problem that sometimes , you know , with with a fricative you might get the beginning of the word cut off

dialogue type : s
A :  and so it 's coupled with the problem that Thilo 's isn't perfect either .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  y i i if the speech - nonspeech were perfect to begin with , the detector , that would already be an improvement ,

dialogue type : sj
A :  but that 's impossible , you know , i that 's too much to ask .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : sj
A :  I think that there always th there would have to be some hand - tweaking ,

dialogue type : sj
A :  but it 's possible that a script could be written to merge those two types of things .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  in terms of not him doing it ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but we we discussed some of the parameters of that

dialogue type : s
A :  and how hard it would be to in principle to write something that would do that .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , it 's just , you know , a matter of we had the revolution we had the revolution of improved , uh , interface , um , one month too late ,

dialogue type : sj
A :  but it 's like , you know , it 's wonderful to have the revolution ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so it 's just a matter of of , you know , from now on we 'll be able to have things channelized to begin with .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  that 's right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  That 's right .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Good point .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
A :  Well the problem is I you know I I it 's a it 's a really good question ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and I really find it a pain in the neck to delete things

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because you have to get the mouse up there on the t on the text line

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I mean , i it depends on how lar

dialogue type : s
A :  th there 's so many extra things that would make it one of them harder than the other , or or vice versa .

dialogue type : sj
A :  It 's not a simple question .

dialogue type : s
A :  But , you know , I mean , in principle , like , you know , if one of them is easier then to bias it towards whichever one 's easier .

dialogue type : sj
A :  I think it 's easier to add than delete , frankly ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because you have to , uh , maneuver around on the on both windows then .

dialogue type : s
A :  To delete .

dialogue type : sj
A :  It 's possible .

dialogue type : fg|sj.%--
A :  Well , like , I think there 's a complication which is that that you can have speech and noise in s

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  uh , you know , on the same channel , the same speaker ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  so now sometimes you get a ni microphone pop

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  and , uh , I mean , there 're these fuzzy hybrid cases ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and then the problem with the boundaries that have to be shifted around .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's not a simple not a simple problem .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , and also , I mean , I still haven't I still haven't given up on forced alignment .

dialogue type : sj.%-
A :  I think that when Brian comes , this 'll be uh an interesting aspect to ask him as well b

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  when Brian Kingsbury comes .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , good question .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Well , Ryan could come .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's what my hope has been ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and that 's what that 's what you know , ever since the the February meeting that I transcribed from last year , forced alignment has been on the on the table as a way of cleaning them up later .

dialogue type : s
A :  And and so I 'm hopeful that that 's possible .

dialogue type : s
A :  I know that there 's complication in the overlap sections and with the lapel mikes ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  I agree .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
A :  I agree .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : sj^ba

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  You said , " Speaking about energy " , or something .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  That was very nice .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  That 's great .

dialogue type : s
A :  I did go through one of these meetings .

dialogue type : s
A :  I had , uh , one of the transcribers go through and tighten up the bins on one of the , uh , NSA meetings ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and then I went through afterwards and double - checked it

dialogue type : s
A :  so that one is really very very accurate .

dialogue type : s
A :  I men I mentioned the link .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  I sent You know that one ?

dialogue type : h|s
A : 

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't remember the number off hand .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^bsc
A :  Bef - What I mean is Wednesday , Thursday .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^df^e
A :  I 've been through it myself .

dialogue type : s
A :  I corrected it for a number of the words .

dialogue type : s
A :  I 'm sure that , um , they 're they 're accurate now .

dialogue type : fh

dialogue type : s
A :  and then they 'd make a comment , and one person said , well - known person said , um , you know , " Before you dismiss forty - five years including my work "
