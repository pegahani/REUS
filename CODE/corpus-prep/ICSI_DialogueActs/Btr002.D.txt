dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
D :  No , that 's not what I meant ,

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  No , what I meant was that I would hope that , for meetings in English you would have native speakers transcribing it

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
D :  Or they just tend to sp peak louder , maybe ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  For announcements and things ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  They should do that at BART , too ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because sometimes it 's hard to hear .

dialogue type : s^aa|s

dialogue type : s^e

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|qy^2^bu^d^rt
D :  Yeah . By filtering or something ?

D :  Good .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , that 's what it seems like .

dialogue type : s
D :  I have a question .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  In the some of the earlier meetings I guess , there was a lot of spikes ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  or what I called spikes .

dialogue type : s
D :  I was wondering what that is .

dialogue type : s^bd^no

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Loose .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba.%-
D :  Cuz those ones sometimes were extraordinarily bad and pai

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : fg|s.%
D :  and like not listen to them .

dialogue type : %-
D :  Or just uh s

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Y y yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yes . Absolutely .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2^bu
D :  And so you turn it down ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I think that 's really important .

dialogue type : fg|s^r
D :  Yeah , I think that 's really important

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because I generally have the volume turned up to above normal volume just so I can hear more clearly ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and if it 's like that for someone screeching into the microphone than it would be really painful .

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
D :  I think you could , yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Especially we have really good headphones ,

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^2.%-
D :  Or , turn up

dialogue type : s^aa|%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  But it would play it backwards too .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  But just to move back , but not necessarily a whole timebin ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Or otherwise , drag it , or like click on it .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think that would be useful .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , because I noticed I started feeling like I was getting some sort of carpal tunnel issues .

dialogue type : s
D :  Much better now that I have the keyboard st tray ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I think cuz I had my hand in one position using it all the time .

dialogue type : s
D :  And that I would it would crack a lot .

dialogue type : s
D :  It was very weird .

dialogue type : fh.%
D :  But .

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh . I see what you 're saying .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  Well , I would press " tab "

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and listen to where I wanted it to stop ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and then press " return " , create a new timebin ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : qw^t1
D :  " shift " , what is it ?

dialogue type : s|s^bk
D :  " Shift " , " backspace " to c collapse it , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy
D :  Oh . Do you drag do you drag the line ?

dialogue type : s
D :  See , I never I never do that for some reason .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^rt
D :  Um , one thing that 's gotten me into problems a little bit is having the " shift - backspace " as the collapser .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because I 'll tend to delete things ,

dialogue type : s^df^e
D :  or go too far , or something ,

dialogue type : s
D :  or I 'll be holding down " shift " because I wanna type something as a capital ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and then end up collapsing the timebins .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So , it might be better to use a different keys or something .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah . Yeah !

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  but , or just to change the keys used , you know , for for that option .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  I 'm used to it too ,

D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I don't think I 'm that bad ,

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's just th right above the backspace .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^am
D :  I think so .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  Amaretto has a different one .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^fe
D :  Ooh !

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s

D : 

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  The PC one is the Amaretto one ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  right ?

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^no

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  I I remember recognizing certain numbers .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  I don mmm , I don't remember which ones ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  well , I could recognize when there was a fricative at the beginning of a number for some reason .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  It was like , a little bit of energy , or some whatever you call it ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and then it grew really big .

dialogue type : s
D :  So like " four " and " five " and " three " all had this same characteristic ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and " six " and " seven " o both had the same characteristics to their in the beginnings .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  But " six " and " eight " ?

dialogue type : s
D :  " Eight " , um , I remember tended that people tended to not pronounce the last " T " .

dialogue type : s
D :  And when they did , it was slightly farther away from the rest of the word than you would have es expected .

dialogue type : s
D :  Same with " six " .

dialogue type : s
D :  The " X " , well the " KS " or whatever , at the end .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  That was a that was really interesting to notice that .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's a very different interface , though .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , it seems very strange .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , I only did it a little bit , too .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  If I remember correctly , it seemed to be very efficient in the key strokes that you used to do certain things .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I can't remember what they were , now ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I just remember that it was once you learned them , it was very neat and concise

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^e
D :  couple keys that you used .

dialogue type : b^rt
D :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
D :  I feel like I did a little checking or something on that .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^no
D :  Yeah . I don't know I don't remember actually transcribing it ,

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  One thing that I still can't figure out with the interface ,

dialogue type : s
D :  it does this sometimes

dialogue type : s
D :  but other times it doesn't ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  it has a little bar of where the meeting is ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  and it goes along as you 're listening to the meeting

dialogue type : s
D :  and then it ends up the end .

dialogue type : s
D :  And if you click on that bar to the right of that little marker then it moves forward ,

dialogue type : s
D :  if you click on the left it moves back .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  But sometimes it moves two frames or two screens ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and sometimes it doesn't .

dialogue type : qy^bh
D :  Really ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Cuz I noticed that a few times it would do it it would move twice

dialogue type : s
D :  and then in n sometimes i it wouldn't ,

dialogue type : s^ba^df
D :  and maybe i maybe I had resolution set differently

dialogue type : %-
D :  or I s

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah . That 's what I tend to do , is I use a soundwave ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but if I 'm trying to scan through a long period of what appears to be silence sometimes I 'll s ry and be sc try to scan it ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I can't

dialogue type : s^df.%-
D :  because

dialogue type : s^2|s^aa
D :  it skips . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So then I end up clicking on the arrow , they have the arrow at the far right ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and so I use that sometimes .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  At the far right and far left there 's a little arrow that allows you to go like second by second or something ,

dialogue type : s^bd^no
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
D :  Not second by second ,

dialogue type : s^bsc|s^bk
D :  but little bit by bit , yeah .

dialogue type : h|s
D :  Um , it 's not on the resolution part .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's where you have it 's where you have the marker of where you are in the meeting .

dialogue type : s
D :  So you have this bar , uh , and then you have a time marker that moves along .

dialogue type : s
D :  Say , you 're halfway through the meeting , it 's gonna be halfway along the line .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa^r
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah !

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s
D :  Maybe we have resolution set totally different .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Cuz I noticed when Jen and I have totally different resolutions ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  cuz hers moves so much quicker than mine ,

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
D :  which means it 's more stretched out , right ?

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah . I usually have it set to where it has , um , point five second intervals on the numbers .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^na
D :  I do too ,

dialogue type : s^df^rt
D :  but sometimes if it gets too too for me too stretched out , um , I 'll tend to think that there 's a break in between a pause inside of a word or something .

dialogue type : s^bd^no
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  So I prefer it to be a little bit tighter ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I 'll stretch I 'll stretch it in a particular place if I need to , or something .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  That 's kind of interesting , though .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well if there 's any left we can grab it .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Ooh , those were good .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  And also that we can I don't know , that we have this shared realm of knowledge , kind of ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and can laugh about things that other people would not understand whatsoever ,

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  You know ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba
D :  Yeah . Yeah . I mean , i it 's really cool .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , or even just about what we were talking about with the technical part , you know , the interface .

dialogue type : s^bd^no
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Yeah , in the very beginning .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I prefer ones that are somewhat linguistically related ,

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na.%-
D :  Exactly . And it 's f really hard t t

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : fg|s.%--

dialogue type : s^no^rt
D :  D d I don't know ,

dialogue type : s
D :  discourse stuff .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think it 's really fun too to listen to when you give reports on transcription .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df
D :  Yeah . Cuz there are always people like , you know , talking bad about the transcribers ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  and just making fun of u

dialogue type : s
D :  And so it 's really funny ,

dialogue type : s^bd^no

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s
D :  I think it 's funny when there 's little side conversations like that , that happen at the same time too .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think those are interesting .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I think it 's really cool when people

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  start getting really excited about something or angry about something

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because then they tend to interrupt each other a lot ,

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s.%-:s.%-
D :  and he was like , " I I I I I I I I I "

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^bsc

dialogue type : s
D :  Both .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  They 're like just trying really hard to get it out before they get interrupted or something ,

dialogue type : s^bd^no

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I tends I you know what I noticed , is it tends to have a still , a dominant group of speakers

dialogue type : s
D :  and then there are two or three people generally who don't talk at all

dialogue type : s
D :  except to say their digits or something ,

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^ba^m
D :  or to breathe and cough and sniff and whatever .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah . But I I think that still overall you 're gonna have probably three or four or five dominant speakers .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Exactly .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  So you 've this is like the tenth time for you , then .

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah . I noticed a lot of my speech i I don't know , I wouldn't call them errors , I guess disfluencies , a lot more once when I started transcribing .

dialogue type : s
D :  I just noticed and in ge people in general , that people break up their speech interestingly .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah !

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Actually .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think that shows a lot of I think that shows a lot of how , um , it 's not all acoustic .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  I mean , there 's other things involved ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  eye contact ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  body language ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  gesture ,

dialogue type : s
D :  whatever .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  I definitely think so .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I think there would be a lot more interesting data to analyze later on , personally .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  And you can really get a feel for the re interpersonal relationships ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  which kind of comes into play , maybe not for speech recognition ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but for other things , maybe ?

dialogue type : s^am
D :  Maybe .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , you just have to rely on your intonation ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and other things like that .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah . Mm - hmm . Maybe .

dialogue type : b
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  That 's pretty amazing .

dialogue type : s
D :  Enhanced other senses , I guess .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  Which is a very it 's that 's how I tended before studying linguistics anyways and , uh , definitely before doing transcription , how I tended to look all conversations ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and then coming here and doing this , you have to look at speech in a totally more intense way .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um .

dialogue type : s
D :  Including , I mean , every little aspect .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  I and when I tell people what I do here ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  and tell them , " Yeah , I 'm transcribing " .

dialogue type : s
D :  And they 're they think I 'm like a stenographer or something .

dialogue type : s:s^ar|s^rt
D :  I 'm like , " No , I don't correct the grammar .

dialogue type : s:s

dialogue type : fg|s

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^no^rt
D :  I don't know if it 's a really a question of me being more c changing my speech necessarily ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I 'm much more aware of interruptions in conversation in normal conversation .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So , uh , maybe I am more careful in the sense that I maybe don't interrupt as much ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  or j I 'm more aware of it when I am doing it ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  or something like that ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  but , um , I just pay attention more to the fact that every pretty much all the time in normal conversation there are interruptions .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^df.%--
D :  I mean , unless you have really aw

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , I think if there were no interruptions it would sound really awkward .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : fh

dialogue type : s^nd.%--

dialogue type : s^bd
D :  see now I 'm contradicting myself ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  but even when it is very turn - taking is very w like people follow the turn - taking rules , or whatever , and don't really blatantly interrupt people ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I I remember this actually from a meeting because Liz was complaining there wasn't enough o interruptions ,

dialogue type : s
D :  or e not enough overlaps , or something .

dialogue type : s
D :  It wasn't interruptions

dialogue type : s
D :  it was overlaps , that I was thinking about .

dialogue type : s
D :  Not enough overlaps .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so she wanted to there to be an argument or something so that there 'd d be more .

dialogue type : s
D :  And ch what she didn't realize was that throughout the meeting up until then there had been ,

dialogue type : s
D :  they were just very small ,

dialogue type : s^rt
