dialogue type : s
F :  So you think we 're going now ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  yes ?

dialogue type : s
F :  OK , good .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Alright

dialogue type : s
F :  Going again

dialogue type : fh|s^co^t
F :  Uh So we 're gonna go around as before , and uh do do our digits .

dialogue type : fh|s^t3
F :  Uh transcript one three one one dash one three three zero . three two three four seven six five five three one six two four one six seven seven eight nine zero nine four zero zero three zero one five eight one seven three five three two six eight zero three six two four three zero seven four five zero six nine four seven four eight five seven nine six one five O seven eight O two zero nine six zero four zero zero one two Uh Yeah , you don't actually n need to say the name .

dialogue type : s^t3
F :  That 'll probably be bleeped out .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  That 's if these are anonymized ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fh|s^j
F :  uh I mean not that there 's anything defamatory about uh eight five seven or or anything ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but

dialogue type : fh|s^tc
F :  Uh , anyway .

dialogue type : fh|s^t
F :  Uh so here 's what I have for I I was just jotting down things I think th w that we should do today .

dialogue type : fh|s^t
F :  Uh This is what I have for an agenda so far

dialogue type : fh|s^co^t
F :  Um , We should talk a little bit about the plans for the uh the field trip next week .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
F :  Uh a number of us are doing a field trip to uh Uh OGI

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  And uh mostly uh First though about the logistics for it .

dialogue type : s^co^t
F :  Then maybe later on in the meeting we should talk about what we actually you know , might accomplish .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fh|s^co^t
F :  Uh , in and kind of go around see what people have been doing talk about that , a r progress report . Um , Essentially .

dialogue type : fh|s^t
F :  Um And then uh Another topic I had was that uh uh Uh Dave here had uh said uh " Give me something to do . "

dialogue type : s
F :  And I I have I have uh failed so far in doing that .

dialogue type : s^co^t
F :  And so maybe we can discuss that a little bit .

dialogue type : s
F :  If we find some holes in some things that that someone could use some help with , he 's he 's volunteering to help .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  OK , always count on a serious comment from that corner .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So , um ,

dialogue type : fh|s^co^t
F :  uh , and uh , then uh , talk a little bit about about disks and resource resource issues that that 's starting to get worked out .

dialogue type : qo^d
F :  And then , anything else anybody has that isn't in that list ?

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : h|s^nd
F : 

dialogue type : %
F :  d do

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  It looks full of electrons .

dialogue type : fh
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  Plenty of electrons left there .

dialogue type : fh
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so , um ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh|s^t
F :  so , uh , I wanted to start this with this mundane thing .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh I I it was it was kind of my bright idea to have us take a plane that leaves at seven twenty in the morning .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : fh|s^df^e
F :  Uh this is uh The reason I did it uh was because otherwise for those of us who have to come back the same day it is really not much of a of a visit .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fh|qw
F :  So um the issue is how how how would we ever accomplish that ?

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
F :  what what what part of town do you live in ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|qy.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  those of you who are not , you know , used to this area , it can be very tricky to get to the airport at at uh , you know , six thirty .

dialogue type : fh|qw
F :  Um . So . Would it be easier for you if you came here and I drove you ?

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah , yeah , OK .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
F :  OK , so if if everybody can get here at six .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df
F :  Yeah , I 'm afraid we need to do that to get there on time .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah , so .

dialogue type : s^fe
F :  Oh boy .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Anyway ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cc
F :  Yeah , so I 'll just pull up in front at six and just be out front .

dialogue type : fh|s^na
F :  And , uh , and yeah , that 'll be plenty of time .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 'll take it it it won't be bad traffic that time of day

dialogue type : fh
F :  and and uh

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  Going to Oakland .

dialogue type : s
F :  Bridge

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  oh , the turnoff to the bridge

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  Won't even do that .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , just go down Martin Luther King .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then Martin Luther King to nine - eighty to eight - eighty ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and it 's it 'd take us , tops uh thirty minutes to get there .

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Great ,

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  so that 'll

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's I mean , it 's still not going to be really easy

dialogue type : s
F :  but well Particularly for for uh for Barry and me ,

dialogue type : s
F :  we 're not we 're not staying overnight

dialogue type : s
F :  so we don't need to bring anything particularly except for uh a pad of paper

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  and So , and , uh you , two have to bring a little bit

dialogue type : fh|s^co^j
F :  but uh you know , don't don't bring a footlocker and we 'll be OK

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  W you 're staying overnight .

dialogue type : s
F :  I figured you wouldn't need a great big suitcase ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  That 's sort of one night .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Anyway .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  Six AM in front .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Uh , I 'll be here .

dialogue type : fh|s^cc
F :  Uh I 'll I 'll I 'll I 'll give you my phone number ,

dialogue type : s^j.%-
F :  If I 'm not here for a few m after a few minutes then

dialogue type : s
F :  Nah , I 'll be fine .

dialogue type : s
F :  I just , uh it for me it just means getting up a half an hour earlier than I usually do .

dialogue type : s
F :  Not not not a lot ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
F :  that was the real real important stuff .

dialogue type : fh|s^co
F :  Um , I I I figured maybe wait on the potential goals for the meeting uh until we talk about wh what 's been going on .

dialogue type : fh|qw
F :  So , uh , what 's been going on ?

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Why don't we start start over here .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
F :  So the HTK base lines so this is using mel cepstra and so on ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  or ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah . OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
F :  What 's the plan again ?

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^co.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  y You just described what you 've been doing .

dialogue type : s^co
F :  So if you could remind me of what you 're going to be doing .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^aa
F :  Oh ! Cube . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s
F :  So - so we had talked I guess we had talked at one point about maybe , the language ID corpus ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Is that a possibility for that ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  That 's really funny

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
F :  isn't it ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean cuz th this whole thing is for developing new standards for the telephone .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah , I know ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh I see ,

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  so your point is that it 's it 's it 's uh the features are computed locally , and so they aren't necessarily telephone bandwidth , uh or telephone distortions .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah , that 's wh that 's wh that 's what I meant .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
F :  the CallFriend is a is a , uh , LDC w thing , right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  I mean , we ' r e e The bandwidth shouldn't be such an issue

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Because e e this is downsampled and and filtered ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s
F :  So it 's just the fact that it 's not telephone .

dialogue type : s
F :  And there are so many other differences between these different databases .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean some of this stuff 's recorded in the car ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean there 's there 's many different acoustic differences .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  So I 'm not sure if . I mean , unless we 're going to include a bunch of car recordings in the in the training database , I 'm not sure if it 's completely rules it out

dialogue type : qy
F :  if our if we if our major goal is to have phonetic context and you figure that there 's gonna be a mismatch in acoustic conditions does it make it much worse f to sort of add another mismatch , if you will .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Uh , i i I I guess the question is how important is it to for us to get multiple languages uh , in there .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^d
F :  So that 's what you 're thinking of using is sort of the multi the equivalent of the multiple ?

dialogue type : s
F :  And for the difference in phonetic context that you ? Provide that .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Well , we also have this Broadcast News that we were talking about taking off the disk , which is is microphone data for for English .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah , so there 's plenty of stuff around .

dialogue type : fg|s^bs
F :  OK , so anyway , th the basic plan is to , uh , test this cube .

dialogue type : %
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^m^na
F :  To fill i fill it in ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : fg|s^aap
F :  Uh , depen it depen it depends how you mean " using the net " .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  So , if you 're talking about for producing these discriminative features that we 're talking about you can't do that .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because because the what they 're asking for is is a feature set .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
F :  And so , uh , we 're the ones who have been weird by by doing this training .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  But if we say , " No , you have to have a different feature set for each language , " I think this is ver gonna be very bad .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  Yeah . I mean , in principle , I mean conceptually , it 's sort of like they want a re @ @ well , they want a replacement for mel cepstra .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , we say " OK , this is the year two thousand ,

dialogue type : s
F :  we 've got something much better than mel cepstra .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's , you know , gobbledy - gook . "

dialogue type : s
F :  OK ? And so we give them these gobbledy - gook features

dialogue type : s
F :  but these gobbledy - gook features are supposed to be good for any language .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Cuz you don't know who 's gonna call ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  and you know , I mean so it 's it 's it 's , uh ,

dialogue type : fh|qw
F :  uh how do you know what language it is ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Somebody picks up the phone .

dialogue type : s
F :  So thi this is their image .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  Someone picks up the phone , right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  And and he he picks up the ph

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah . y y y

dialogue type : fh
F :  Well .

dialogue type : s
F :  But , no but , y you you pick up the phone ,

dialogue type : s
F :  you talk on the phone ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and it sends features out .

dialogue type : fh
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so the phone doesn't know what a what what your language is .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  But that 's the image that they have .

dialogue type : s^aap
F :  It could be ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but that 's the image they have ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , one could argue all over the place about how things really will be in ten years .

dialogue type : s
F :  But the particular image that the cellular industry has right now is that it 's distributed speech recognition , where the , uh , uh , probabilistic part , and and s semantics and so forth are all on the servers , and you compute features of the uh , on the phone .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that 's that 's what we 're involved in .

dialogue type : s
F :  We might might or might not agree that that 's the way it will be in ten years ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but that 's that 's that 's what they 're asking for .

dialogue type : s
F :  So so I think that th th it is an important issue whether it works cross - language .

dialogue type : s
F :  Now , it 's the OGI , uh , folks ' perspective right now that probably that 's not the biggest deal .

dialogue type : s
F :  And that the biggest deal is the , um envir acoustic - environment mismatch .

dialogue type : s
F :  And they may very well be right ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  but I I was hoping we could just do a test and determine if that was true .

dialogue type : s
F :  If that 's true , we don't need to worry so much .

dialogue type : s
F :  Maybe maybe we have a couple languages in the training set and that gives us enough breadth uh , uh , that that that the rest doesn't matter .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Um , the other thing is , uh , this notion of training to uh which I I guess they 're starting to look at up there , training to something more like articulatory features .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Uh , and if you have something that 's just good for distinguishing different articulatory features that should just be good across , you know , a wide range of languages .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Yeah , so I don't th I know unfortunately I don't I see what you 're comi where you 're coming from , I think ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but I don't think we can ignore it .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so , um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  This is complex .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  So , ultimately , uh , as I was saying , I think it doesn't fit within their image that you switch nets based on language .

dialogue type : qy
F :  Now , can you include , uh , the the target language ?

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Um , from a purist 's standpoint it 'd be nice not to

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  because surely someone is going to say at some point , " OK , so you put in the German and the Finnish .

dialogue type : fh|qw
F :  Uh , now , what do you do , uh , when somebody has Portuguese ? "

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  you know ?

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Um , and Uh , however , you aren't it isn't actually a constraint in this evaluation .

dialogue type : s
F :  So I would say if it looks like there 's a big difference to put it in , then we 'd make note of it , and then we probably put in the other ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because we have so many other problems in trying to get things to work well here that that , you know , it 's not so bad as long as we we note it and say , " Look , we did do this " .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , cuz the truth is , is that it 's it 's not like there are I mean , al although there are thousands of languages , uh , from uh , uh , the point of view of cellular companies , there aren't .

dialogue type : s
F :  There 's you know , there 's fifty or something ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  you know ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  So ,

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  uh , an and they aren't you know , with the exception of Finnish , which I guess it 's pretty different from most most things .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  uh , it 's it 's , uh most of them are like at least some of the others .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so , our guess that Spanish is like Italian , and and so on .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  I guess Finnish is a is is a little bit like Hungarian , supposedly ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  well , I kn oh , well I know that H uh , H I mean , I 'm not a linguist , but I guess Hungarian and Finnish and one of the one of the languages from the former Soviet Union are in this sort of same family .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^co^t^tc
F :  Your turn .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Oh , good .

dialogue type : qy^j^rt
F :  So are are you going to be assimilated ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
F :  And again , when y just to clarify , when you 're talking about training up a net , you 're talking about training up a net for a tandem approach ?

dialogue type : s^e
F :  And and the inputs are PLP and delta and that sort of thing ,

dialogue type : %
F :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
F :  Yeah , but your initial things you 're making one choice there ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
F :  right ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^e^rt
F :  Which is PLP , or something ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah . Um ,

dialogue type : fh|s^bu
F :  so so you take PLP and you you , uh , do it uh , you you , uh , use HTK with it with the transformed features using a neural net that 's trained .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  And the training could either be from Digits itself or from TIMIT .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  and , and th and then the testing would be these other things which which which might be foreign language .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  I see .

dialogue type : s
F :  I I I get in the picture about the cube .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , those listening to this will not have a picture either ,

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  so , um , I guess I 'm I 'm not any worse off .

dialogue type : %-
F :  But

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  but at some point somebody should just show me the cube .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  It sounds s

dialogue type : s
F :  I I get I think I get the general idea of it ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : fg|qw
F :  Ah , but which Dan ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Well , especially when you go over the different languages again ,

dialogue type : s
F :  because you 'd the different languages have different words for the different digits ,

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  I I think it would ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but but on the other hand it might be better .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Oh yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but still @ @ probably use it .

dialogue type : fg
F :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s
F :  you know , I I I guess I 'm sounding cavalier ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but I mean , I think the point is you have , uh , a bunch of labels and and they 're han hand uh hand - marked .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Uh , I guess , actually , TIMIT was not entirely hand - marked .

dialogue type : s
F :  It was automatically first , and then hand hand - corrected .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  But but , um , uh , it it , um , it might be a better source .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  you 're right .

dialogue type : qr
F :  It would be another interesting scientific question to ask , " Is it because it 's a broad source or because it was , you know , carefully ? "

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  uh . And that 's something you could ask ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but given limited time , I think the main thing is if it 's a better thing for going across languages on this training tandem system ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  You mean a superset , sort of .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Um , I forget if that happened starting with you , or was it o or if it was Eric , afterwards who did that .

dialogue type : s
F :  But I think , basically , there were several of the phones that were just hardly ever there .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah , especially in a system like ours , which is a discriminative system .

dialogue type : s
F :  You know , you 're really asking this net to learn .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's it 's kind of hard .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  i It 's actually pretty common that a lot of the recognition systems people use have things like like , say thirty - nine , phone symbols ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Uh , and then they get the variety by by bringing in the context , the phonetic context .

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh . So we actually have an unusually large number in in what we tend to use here .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , a a actually maybe now you 've got me sort of intrigued .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : qy^co^rt
F :  Can you describe what what 's on the cube ?

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  and since you 're not running a video camera we won't get this ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but if you use a board it 'll help us anyway .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Uh , point out one of the limitations of this medium ,

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  but you 've got the wireless on ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so you can walk around .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  Uh , he can't , actually ,

dialogue type : %
F : 

dialogue type : s^e
F :  He 's tethered .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
F :  Yeah . So the the training for HTK is always that 's always set up for the individual test ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s
F :  That there 's some training data and some test data .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  So that 's different than this .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh . Ah . Ah .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  Well , y you do have a baseline system that 's m that 's mel cepstra ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Probably should .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean at least at least conceptually , you know , it doesn't meant you actually have to do it ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but

dialogue type : s^df
F :  conceptually it makes sense as a as a base line .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Um , I think OGI folks have been doing that , too .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  D Because I think that for a bunch of their experiments they used , uh , mel cepstra , actually .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Um , of course that 's there and this is here and so on .

dialogue type : s^rt^tc
F :  OK ?

dialogue type : s.%
F :  Italian .

dialogue type : s^t3
F :  The newer one .

dialogue type : s^aa^t3
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so Carmen brought the Spanish ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and Stephane brought the French .

dialogue type : qr
F :  Is it French French or Belgian French ?

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^am
F :  probably so .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  Yeah , Herve always insists that Belgian is i is absolutely pure French ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  but he says those those those Parisians talk funny .

dialogue type : s^aa.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  they do , yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
F :  Yeah . But then he likes Belgian fries too ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so .

dialogue type : fh
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  y And I think Stephane was saying there 's there 's some broader s material in the French also ?

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
F :  i Is it is it Mexican Spanish ,

dialogue type : qrr.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk^m
F :  Oh , no , no .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's it 's Spanish from Spain , Spanish .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
F :  Spanish from Spain .

dialogue type : s
F :  Yeah , we 're really covered there

dialogue type : fh
F :  now . OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  And the French from France .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  From TI .

dialogue type : s
F :  From i It 's from Texas .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^j
F :  So - s so it 's not really from the US either .

dialogue type : qy
F :  Is that ? OK .

dialogue type : s^arp
F :  I think what they were saying was that , um , for this next test there 's gonna be some of the cases where they have the same type of noise as you were given before hand and some cases where you 're not .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , presumably , that 'll be part of the topic of analysis of the the test results , is how well you do when it 's matching noise and how well you do where it 's not .

dialogue type : s
F :  I think that 's right .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Well , not if it 's not seen ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  OK . I mean , i i i i it does seem to me that a lot of times when you train with something that 's at least a little bit noisy it can it can help you out in other kinds of noise

dialogue type : s^e
F :  even if it 's not matching

dialogue type : s^df
F :  just because there 's some more variance that you 've built into things .

dialogue type : fh
F :  But , but , uh ,

dialogue type : s
F :  uh , exactly how well it will work will depend on how near it is to what you had ahead of time .

dialogue type : s
F :  So . OK , so that 's your training corpus ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  and then your testing corpus ?

dialogue type : h
F :  Well , so ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bu^na
F :  the final test , on a guess , is supposed to be German and Danish ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  Oh , there 's a there 's Spanish testing in the Aurora ?

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so , uh ,

dialogue type : s^co
F :  something like seven things in each , uh each column .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that 's , uh , three hundred and forty - three , uh , different systems that are going to be developed .

dialogue type : s
F :  There 's three of you .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  so that 's

dialogue type : s
F :  hundred and hundred and fourteen each .

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
F :  What ?

dialogue type : qh^j^rt
F :  Are you just trying to be difficult ?

dialogue type : s^t3
F :  I 'm just kidding .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : qw
F :  so I guess the question is how long does it take to do a a training ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean , it 's not totally crazy

dialogue type : s
F :  t I mean , these are a lot of these are built - in things

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and we know we have programs that compute PLP ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  we have MSG ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
F :  we have JRA

dialogue type : s
F :  you know , a lot of these things will just kind of happen ,

dialogue type : s
F :  won't take uh a huge amount of development ,

dialogue type : s
F :  it 's just trying it out .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , we actually can do quite a few experiments .

dialogue type : qw
F :  But how how long does it take , do we think , for one of these trainings ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  that 's right .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  I mean , cuz ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  good point .

dialogue type : s
F :  A major advantage of MSG , I see , th that we 've seen in the past is combined with PLP .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : fg
F :  so , I mean ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  you don't wanna ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^t1
F :  Let 's see ,

dialogue type : s
F :  seven choose two would be , uh , twenty - one different combinations .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
F :  What ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  I hope not .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s^co
F :  so PLP and MSG I think we definitely wanna try

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz we 've had a lot of good experience with putting those together .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so i it doesn't increase the number of trainings .

dialogue type : h|s^nd
F :  Uh , I don't think so .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  I mean , it 's just more compu

dialogue type : qw^br^d^rt
F :  Excuse me ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  we haven't talked about any of that at all ,

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
F :  have we ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^nd^rt
F :  so , there 's not really a limit .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  What it is is that there 's there 's , uh it 's just penalty ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  you know ?

dialogue type : s^e
F :  That that if you 're using , uh , a megabyte , then they 'll say that 's very nice ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  but , of course , it will never go on a cheap cell phone .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And ,

dialogue type : s
F :  u uh , I think the computation isn't so much of a problem .

dialogue type : s
F :  I think it 's more the memory .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Uh , and , expensive cell phones , exa expensive hand - helds , and so forth , are gonna have lots of memory .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  So it 's just that , uh , these people see the the cheap cell phones as being still the biggest market ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : fg
F :  But , yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I was just realizing that , actually , it doesn't explode out ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's not really two to the seventh .

dialogue type : s
F :  But it 's but but i i it doesn't really explode out the number of trainings

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz these were all trained individually .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  So ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  uh , if you have all of these nets trained some place , then , uh , you can combine their outputs and do the KL transformation and so forth

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  So , what it it blows out is the number of uh testings .

dialogue type : s
F :  And , you know and the number of times you do that last part .

dialogue type : s
F :  But that last part , I think , is so has gotta be pretty quick ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , you gotta do the KL transformation ,

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Good question .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  One would think one net ,

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  but we 've I don't think we 've tested that .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so , I guess the first thing is if w if we know how much a how long a a training takes ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  if we can train up all these these combinations , uh , then we can start working on testing of them individually , and in combination .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because the putting them in combination , I think , is not as much computationally as the r training of the nets in the first place .

dialogue type : qy^d^g.%
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
F :  So y you do have to compute the KL transformation .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which is a little bit ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  but it 's not too much .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Uh , right .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qw
F :  How long does it take for an , uh , HTK training ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  For HTK ?

dialogue type : qh^bk
F :  Really ?

dialogue type : qw^d
F :  Running on what ?

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No ,

dialogue type : s^fa
F :  I 'm sorry ,

dialogue type : qw^d
F :  ru running on what machine ?

dialogue type : h
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I don't know what Ravioli is .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Is it is it an Ultra - five ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
F :  or is it a ?

dialogue type : s^2
F :  It 's a few hours .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah . Right ,

dialogue type : fg
F :  so ,

dialogue type : fg
F :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  clearly , there there 's no way we can even begin to do an any significant amount here unless we use multiple machines .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean there 's plenty of machines here

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and they 're n they 're often not in in a great great deal of use .

dialogue type : s^co
F : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
F :  Uh , are we still using P - make ?

dialogue type : qy.%-
F :  Is that ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , once you get the basic thing set up , you have just all the uh , a all these combinations ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's it 's let 's say it 's six hours or eight hours , or something for the training of HTK .

dialogue type : qw
F :  How long is it for training of of , uh , the neural net ?

dialogue type : fg
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : qw^d
F :  but on what machine ?

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
F :  again , we do have a bunch of SPERT boards .

dialogue type : s
F :  And I think there there there 's I think you folks are probably go the ones using them right now .

dialogue type : h|s^no
F :  Uh , don't know .

dialogue type : s^aap
F :  Used to be .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  we have quite a few SPERT boards .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  You could set up , uh , you know , ten different jobs , or something , to run on SPERT different SPERT boards

dialogue type : s
F :  and and have ten other jobs running on different computers .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , it 's got to take that sort of thing ,

dialogue type : s
F :  or or we 're not going to get through any significant number of these .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah , I mean ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^ar
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  uh , no , what I like about it is

dialogue type : s
F :  we we we do have a problem

dialogue type : s^e
F :  that we have very limited time .

dialogue type : fh
F :  You know ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so , with very limited time , we actually have really quite a quite a bit of computational resource available

dialogue type : s^df
F :  if you , you know , get a look across the institute and how little things are being used .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I think it 's a great thing to go to .

dialogue type : s
F :  But if it 's new , then we have this development and and and learning process t to to go through on top of just the the all the all the work .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  So , I I I don't see how we 'd do it .

dialogue type : s
F :  So what I like about this is you basically have listed all the things that we already know how to do .

dialogue type : s
F :  And and all the kinds of data that we , at this point , already have .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  And , uh , you 're just saying let 's look at the outer product of all of these things

dialogue type : s
F :  and see if we can calculate them .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
F :  a a Am I am I interpreting this correctly ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
F :  Is this sort of what what you 're thinking of doing in the short term ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^co
F :  So so then I think it 's just the the missing piece is that you need to , uh , you know you know , talk to talk to , uh , Chuck , talk to , uh , Adam ,

dialogue type : s^co
F :  uh , sort out about , uh , what 's the best way to really , you know , attack this as a as a as a mass problem in terms of using many machines .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^co
F :  and uh , then , you know , set it up in terms of scripts and so forth , and uh , in in kind o some kind of structured way .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^co
F :  Um , and , you know , when we go to , uh , OGI next week , uh , we can then present to them , you know , what it is that we 're doing .

dialogue type : fh|s^co
F :  And , uh , we can pull things out of this list that we think they are doing sufficiently ,

dialogue type : s
F :  that , you know , we 're not we won't be contributing that much .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Then , uh , like , we 're there .

dialogue type : qw^bu^d^rt
F :  Broader class ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  it 's not actually broader class ,

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  it 's actually finer class ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but you mean y You mean more classes .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Carmen , did you do you have something else to add ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  We you haven't talked too much ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : h|s
F :  Well , um , JRASTA has the potential to do better ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but it doesn't always .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  It 's i i JRASTA is more complicated .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  It 's it 's , uh instead of doing RASTA with a log , you 're doing RASTA with a log - like function that varies depending on a J parameter ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  uh , which is supposed to be sensitive to the amount of noise there is .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  So , it 's sort of like the right transformation to do the filtering in , is dependent on how much noise there is .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so in JRASTA you attempt to do that .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's a little complicated

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because once you do that , you end up in some funny domain

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and you end up having to do a transformation afterwards ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which requires some tables .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And , uh ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so it 's it 's it 's a little messier ,

dialogue type : s
F :  uh , there 's more ways that it can go wrong ,

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  uh , but if if if you 're careful with it , it can do better .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^br
F :  I I didn't understand .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  " l labeled " .

dialogue type : s^fa
F :  I 'm sorry ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I have a p I had a problem with the pronunciation .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
F :  So ,

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^co
F :  so let 's start over .

dialogue type : s^bs
F :  So , TI TIMI TIMIT 's hand - labeled ,

dialogue type : qw^br^d^rt
F :  and and you 're saying about the Spanish ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : %-
F :  So you

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  So it 's just usual kind of uh sometimes say housekeeping ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s^e
F :  To get these get these things sorted out .

dialogue type : s
F :  So it seems like there 's there 's some peculiarities of the , uh of each of these dimensions that are getting sorted out .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then , um , if if you work on getting the , uh , assembly lines together , and then the the pieces sort of get ready to go into the assembly line

dialogue type : s
F :  and gradually can start , you know , start turning the crank , more or less .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And , uh , uh ,

dialogue type : s
F :  we have a lot more computational capability here than they do at OGI ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  What 's what 's great about this is it sets it up in a very systematic way ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  so that , uh , once these all of these , you know , mundane but real problems get sorted out , we can just start turning the crank

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  and and push all of us through ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  and then finally figure out what 's best .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , yeah , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  sure .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  No , I 'm just saying , I 'm just thinking of it like loops ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s
F :  And so , y y y if you had three nested loops , that you have a choice for this , a choice for this , and a choice for that ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s
F :  And you 're going through them all .

dialogue type : s
F :  That that 's what I meant .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  And , uh , the thing is that once you get a better handle on how much you can realistically do , uh , um , concurrently on different machines , different SPERTs , and so forth , uh , and you see how long it takes on what machine and so forth , you can stand back from it and say , " OK , if we look at all these combinations we 're talking about , and combinations of combinations , and so forth , " you 'll probably find you can't do it all .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^co
F :  so then at that point , uh , we should sort out which ones do we throw away .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Which of the combinations across you know , what are the most likely ones ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  And , uh ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I still think we could do a lot of them .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  I mean , it wouldn't surprise me if we could do a hundred of them or something .

dialogue type : s
F :  But , probably when you include all the combinations , you 're actually talking about a thousand of them or something ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and that 's probably more than we can do .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^bd
F :  but a hundred is a lot .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  His his stuff is somewhere else ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  I mean , my point

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^ft
F :  thanks for bring it back to that .

dialogue type : s
F :  My th I want to clarify my point about that that that Chuck repeated in his note .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s
F :  We 're over the next year or two , we 're gonna be upgrading the networks in this place ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but right now they 're still all te pretty much all ten megabit lines .

dialogue type : s
F :  And we have reached the this the machines are getting faster and faster .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , it actually has reached the point where it 's a significant drag on the time for something to move the data from one place to another .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So , you you don't w especially in something with repetitive computation where you 're going over it multiple times , you do don't want to have the the data that you 're working on distant from where it 's being where the computation 's being done if you can help it .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
F :  Now , we are getting more disk for the central file server ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which , since it 's not a computational server , would seem to be a contradiction to what I just said .

dialogue type : s
F :  But the idea is that , uh , suppose you 're working with , uh , this big bunch of multi multilingual databases .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  you put them all in the central ser at the cen central file server .

dialogue type : s
F :  Then , when you 're working with something and accessing it many times , you copy the piece of it that you 're working with over to some place that 's close to where the computation is and then do all the work there .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  And then that way you you won't have the the network you won't be clogging the network for yourself and others .

dialogue type : s
F :  That 's the idea .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  It may be too late for this , uh , p precise crunch we 're in now ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but , uh ,

dialogue type : %--
F :  we 're ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's gonna take us a couple weeks at least to get the , uh , uh , the amount of disk we 're gonna be getting . We 're actually gonna get ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  uh , I think four more , uh , thirty - six gigabyte drives

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  and , uh , put them on another another disk rack .

dialogue type : s
F :  We ran out of space on the disk rack that we had ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so we 're getting another disk rack and four more drives to share between , uh primarily between this project and the Meetings Meetings Project .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
F :  But , uh ,

dialogue type : s
F :  we 've put another I guess there 's another eighteen gigabytes that 's that 's in there now to help us with the immediate crunch .

dialogue type : fh
F :  But , uh ,

dialogue type : qw
F :  Stephane , where you 're doing your computations .

dialogue type : s
F :  If i so , you 're on an NT machine ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so you 're using some external machine

dialogue type : qy
F :  Do you know these yet ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : qy
F :  are these are these , uh , computational servers , or something ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I 'm I 've been kind of out of it .

dialogue type : s^j
F :  Unfortunately , these days my idea of running comput of computa doing computation is running a spread sheet .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  haven't been haven't been doing much computing personally ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so those are computational servers .

dialogue type : s
F :  So I guess the other question is what disk there i space there is there on the computational servers .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^j
F :  Well , you 're the you 're the disk czar now .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah , so basically , uh , Chuck will be the one who will be sorting out what disk needs to be where , and so on ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and I 'll be the one who says , " OK , spend the money . "

dialogue type : s^e.%--
F :  So . Which , I mean , n

dialogue type : s
F :  these days , uh , if you 're talking about scratch space , it doesn't increase the , uh , need for backup ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
F :  and , uh , I think it 's not that big a d

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and the the disks themselves are not that expensive .

dialogue type : s^e.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qy^bu.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  I think Dave was saying that he preferred that people didn't put stuff in slash - scratch .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
F :  It 's more putting in d s XA or XB or ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  I see .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so es so especially if you 're right , if you 're if you 're taking some piece of the training corpus , which usually resides in where Chuck is putting it all on the on the , uh , file server , uh , then , yeah , it 's fine if it 's not backed up

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because if it g g gets wiped out or something , y I mean it is backed up on the other disk .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah ,

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Sure .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Um ,

dialogue type : fg
F :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qw
F :  an another question occurred to me is is what were you folks planning to do about normalization ?

dialogue type : qw^bu^d
F :  This being ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^ba^na
F :  I think that 's a good idea .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean it 's i i we we seem to have enough dimensions as it is .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  probably the on - line line normalization

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because then it it 's if we do anything else , we 're gonna end up having to do on - line normalization too ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  so we may as well just do on - line normalization .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  Um . So that it 's plausible for the final thing .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Good .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Um .

dialogue type : %--
F :  So , I guess ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I maybe we 're already there , or almost there , is goals for the for next week 's meeting .

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh . i i i it seems to me that we wanna do is flush out what you put on the board here .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  You know , maybe , have it be somewhat visual , a little bit .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  so w we can say what we 're doing ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  And , um , also , if you have sorted out , um , this information about how long i roughly how long it takes to do on what and , you know , what we can how many of these trainings , uh , uh , and testings and so forth that we can realistically do , uh , then one of the big goals of going there next week would be to to actually settle on which of them we 're gonna do .

dialogue type : fh|s^co
F :  And , uh , when we come back we can charge in and do it .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : qo.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I a a Actually started out this this field trip started off with with , uh , Stephane talking to Hynek ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so you may have you may have had other goals , uh , for going up ,

dialogue type : qo^d^rt
F :  and any anything else you can think of would be we should think about accomplishing ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean , I 'm just saying this because maybe there 's things we need to do in preparation .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
F :  And uh and the other the the last topic I had here was , um , uh d Dave 's fine offer to to , uh , do something on this .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean he 's doing he 's working on other things ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  but to to do something on this project .

dialogue type : qw
F :  So the question is , " Where where could we , uh , uh , most use Dave 's help ? "

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^am
F : 

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  the only problem I have with it is exactly the same reason why you thought it 'd be a good thing to do .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^co
F :  Let 's fall back to that .

dialogue type : s^co.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^ba^t3
F :  that 's a good thing you remove the mike .

dialogue type : s^co^t3
F :  Go ahead ,

dialogue type : s^ba^t3
F :  good .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh .

dialogue type : s
F :  What an additional clever person could help with when we 're really in a crunch for time .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Cuz Dave 's gonna be around for a long time ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s^e
F :  He 's he 's gonna be here for years .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And so , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  over years , if he 's if he 's interested in , you know , voiced - unvoiced - silence , he could do a lot .

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  We have we we 've , you know , only , uh , another another month or two to you know , with the holidays in the middle of it , um , to to get a lot done .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  The very fact that it is sort of just work , and i and it 's running programs and so forth , is exactly why it 's possible that it some piece of could be handed to someone to do ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh , yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so that that 's the question .

dialogue type : s
F :  And we don't have to solve it right this s second ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  but if we could think of some some piece that 's that 's well defined , that he could help with ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  he 's expressing a will willingness to do that .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : h
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
F :  that 's something that needs to be done

dialogue type : s^e
F :  in any event .

dialogue type : s
F :  So what we were just saying is that that , um I was arguing for , if possible , coming up with something that that really was development and wasn't research

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because we we 're we have a time crunch .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  And so , uh , if there 's something that would would save some time that someone else could do on some other piece , then we should think of that first .

dialogue type : s
F :  See the thing with voiced - unvoiced - silence is I really think that that it 's to do to do a a a a poor job is is pretty quick ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  or , you know , a so - so job .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  You can you can you can throw in a couple fea

dialogue type : s
F :  we know what what kinds of features help with it .

dialogue type : s
F :  You can throw something in .

dialogue type : s
F :  You can do pretty well .

dialogue type : s
F :  But I remember , in fact , when you were working on that ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and you worked on for few months , as I recall ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and you got to , say ninety - three percent ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and getting to ninety - four really really hard .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  So ,

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  And th th the other tricky thing is , since we are ,

dialogue type : s
F :  uh , even though we 're not we don't have a strict prohibition on memory size , and and computational complexity , uh , clearly there 's some limitation to it .

dialogue type : s
F :  So if we have to if we say we have to have a pitch detector , say , if we if we 're trying to incorporate pitch information , or at least some kind of harmonic harmonicity , or something , this is another whole thing ,

dialogue type : s
F :  take a while to develop .

dialogue type : s
F :  Anyway , it 's a very very interesting topic .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , one I think one of the a lot of people would say , and I think Dan would also , uh , that one of the things wrong with current speech recognition is that we we really do throw away all the harmonicity information .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Uh , we try to get spectral envelopes .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Reason for doing that is that most of the information about the phonetic identity is in the spectral envelopes are not in the harmonic detail .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  But the harmonic detail does tell you something .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Like the fact that there is harmonic detail is is real important .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So , uh .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bs
F :  So wh that so the the other suggestion that just came up was , well what about having him work on the , uh , multilingual super f superset kind of thing .

dialogue type : fh|s^bs
F :  Uh , coming up with that and then , you know , training it training a net on that , say , um , from from , uh from TIMIT or something .

dialogue type : s
F :  Is that or uh , for multiple databases .

dialogue type : qw.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qw
F :  wh what would this task consist of ?

dialogue type : fg|s^bu
F :  Uh , creating a superset from looking at the multiple languages ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  and then creating i m changing labels on TIMIT ?

dialogue type : qrr^bu^d
F :  Or on or on multiple language multiple languages ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^co
F :  Go ahead .

dialogue type : qw.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Has OGI done anything about this issue ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Do they have Do they have any kind of superset that they already have ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Aha .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh , and that 's an interesting way to go too .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that does make an interesting question , though .

dialogue type : s
F :  Is there 's some way that we should tie into that with this .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : qy
F :  I mean , if if in fact that is a better thing to do , should we leverage that , rather than doing , um , our own .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So , if i if if they s

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , we have i we have the the trainings with our own categories .

dialogue type : s
F :  And now we 're saying , " Well , how do we handle cross - language ? "

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  And one way is to come up with a superset ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but they are als they 're trying coming up with clustered ,

dialogue type : qy
F :  and do we think there 's something wrong with that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : %-
F :  What w

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  You 're using this for the feature generation ,

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Did they not do that ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
F :  or ?

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  They 're talking about it ,

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  but that 's sort of a question whether they did

dialogue type : s
F :  because that 's that 's the other route to go .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
F :  Instead of the the the the superclass thing ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So suppose y you don't really mark arti

dialogue type : s
F :  To really mark articulatory features , you really wanna look at the acoustics and and see where everything is ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and we 're not gonna do that .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So ,

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  uh , the second class way of doing it is to look at the , uh , phones that are labeled

dialogue type : s
F :  and translate them into acoustic uh , uh articulatory , uh , uh , features .

dialogue type : s
F :  So it won't really be right .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  You won't really have these overlapping things and so forth ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^2
F :  Articulatory feature .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  You either do that or you have multiple nets .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um . And , um

dialogue type : s^bu^no^rt
F :  I don't know if our software this if the qu versions of the Quicknet that we 're using allows for that .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Do you know ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Multiple targets being one ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that that 'll work ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
F :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs^e
F :  is that we could we could , uh , just translate instead of translating to a superset , just translate to articulatory features , some set of articulatory features and train with that .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Now the fact even though it 's a smaller number , it 's still fine

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because you have the the , uh , combinations .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  So , in fact , it has every , you know it had has has every distinction in it that you would have the other way .

dialogue type : s
F :  But it should go across languages better .

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No .

dialogue type : s
F :  This was the guy that we were just talking a that we saw on campus .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  So , this was Larry Saul who did this did this .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  He used sonorants .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Was what he was doing .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  He he di he didn't mention that part .

dialogue type : fh
F :  But .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  I see .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Should be .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because if you get all of them in there , that defines all of the phones .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  So that 's that 's equivalent to saying that you 've got got all the phones right .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Although , yeah , it would be make an interesting cheating experiment

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because we are using it in this funny way ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  where we 're converting it into features .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Did we just run out of disk ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
F :  or ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  So , we 're we 're we 're off the air ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
F :  or ?

dialogue type : s^aap
F :  About to be off the air .
