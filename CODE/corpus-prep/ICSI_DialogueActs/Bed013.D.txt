dialogue type : s
D :  It 's great how the br brain sort of does that .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So the news for me is A , my forthcoming travel plans

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  in two weeks from today ?

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
D :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  More or less ?

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  I 'll be off to Sicily and Germany for a couple , three days .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  OK , I 'm flying to Sicily basically to drop off Simon there with his grandparents .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then I 'm flying to Germany t to go to a MOKU - Treffen

dialogue type : s
D :  which is the meeting of all the module - responsible people in SmartKom ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and , represent ICI

dialogue type : s
D :  and myself I guess there .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And um .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's the mmm actual reason .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then I 'm also going up to EML for a day ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and then I 'm going to meet the very big boss , Wolfgang Walster , in Saarbruecken and the System system integration people in Kaiserslautern

dialogue type : s
D :  and then I 'm flying back via Sicily

dialogue type : s
D :  pick up my son

dialogue type : s
D :  come back here on the fourth of July .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And uh .

dialogue type : s^j
D :  And I 'm sure all the the people at the airport will be happy to work on that day .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  Alitalia .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
D :  And um ,

dialogue type : s^t^tc
D :  that 's that bit of news ,

dialogue type : s^rt^t^tc
D :  and the other bit of news is we had you know , uh , I was visited by my German project manager

dialogue type : s^rt
D : 

dialogue type : s^e^rt
D :  what we 're doing here ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and B , is planning to come here either three weeks in July or three weeks in August , to actually work .

dialogue type : s
D :  With us .

dialogue type : s
D :  And we sat around and we talked

dialogue type : s
D :  and he came up we came up with a pretty strange idea .

dialogue type : s^t
D :  And that 's what I 'm gonna lay on you now .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And um , maybe it might be ultimately the most interesting thing for Eva

dialogue type : s
D :  because she has been known to complain about the fact that the stuff we do here is not weird enough .

dialogue type : s
D :  So this is so weird it should even make you happy .

dialogue type : s
D :  Imagine if you will , that we have a system that does all that understanding that we want it to do based on utterances .

dialogue type : s
D :  It should be possible to make that system produce questions .

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  So if you have the knowledge of how to interpret " where is X ? " under given conditions , situational , user , discourse and ontological conditions , you should also be able to make that same system ask " where is X ? "

dialogue type : s^e
D :  in a sper certain way ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  based on certain intentions .

dialogue type : s
D :  So in instead of just being able to observe phenomenon , um , and , guess the intention we might be able just to sort of give it an intention , and make it produce an utterance .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : s
D :  And once you 've done that what we can do is have the system ask itself .

dialogue type : s
D :  And answer ,

dialogue type : s
D :  understand the answer ,

dialogue type : s
D :  ask something else ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and enter a dialogue with itself .

dialogue type : s
D :  So the the ba basic the same idea as having two chess computers play against each other .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  Yeah you c if you want , you can have two parallel machines um , asking each other .

dialogue type : qh
D :  What would that give us ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Would A be something completely weird and strange ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and B , i if you look at all the factors , we will never observe people let 's say , in wheelchairs under you know , in under all conditions ,

dialogue type : s
D :  you know , when they say " X " , and there is a ride at the goal , and the parking is good , we can never collect enough data .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  It 's it 's it 's not possible .

dialogue type : s
D :  But maybe one could do some learning .

dialogue type : s
D :  If you get the system to speak to itself , you may find n break downs and errors and you may be able to learn .

dialogue type : s
D :  And make it more robust ,

dialogue type : s
D :  maybe learn new things .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so there 's no no end of potential things one could get out of it , if that works .

dialogue type : s
D :  And he would like to actually work on that with us .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So

dialogue type : s^aap|s.%--
D :  Yeah , I w

dialogue type : s^ba^df
D :  See the the generation bit , making the system generate generate something , is shouldn't be too hard .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  Yeah . Well , if we can get it to understand one thing , like our " where is " run through we can also , maybe , e make it say , or ask " where is X ? " Or not .

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , I 've I 've done generation and language production research for fo four four and a half years .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so it 's it 's you 're right ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  it 's not the same as the understanding .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  It 's in some ways easier and some ways harder . nuh ?

dialogue type : fh
D :  But , um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I think it 'd be fun to look at it , or into that question .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  It 's a pretty strange idea .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Well , look at th

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  What it would be the the prior intention .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  No . Let 's we have to we have some some top - down processing , given certain setting .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  OK , now we change nothing , and just say ask something .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : qw
D :  What would it ask ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  It shur

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah !

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D :  Eh , n

dialogue type : qy
D :  Ooh , do we really need to do that ?

dialogue type : s^df.%-
D :  Because ,

dialogue type : %--
D :  s

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  It 's i I know it 's it 's strange ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but look at it look at our Bayes - net .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g^rt
D :  If we don't have Let 's assume we don't have any input from the language . Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So there 's also nothing we could query the ontology ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but we have a certain user setting .

dialogue type : s
D :  If you just ask , what is the likelihood of that person wanting to enter some something , it 'll give you an answer .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's just how they are .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so , @ @ whatever that is , it 's the generic default intention . That it would find out .

dialogue type : s
D :  Which is , wanting to know where something is ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I don't know what it 's gonna be ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  but there 's gonna be something that

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  Well you can observe some user and context stuff and ask , what 's the posterior probabilities of all of our decision nodes .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  You could even say , " let 's take all the priors ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  let 's observe nothing " , and query all the posterior probabilities .

dialogue type : s
D :  It - it 's gonna tell us something .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  Yes . And come up with posterior probabilities for all the values of the decision nodes .

dialogue type : s
D :  Which , if we have an algorithm that filters out whatever the the best or the most consistent answer out of that , will give us the intention ex nihilo .

dialogue type : s
D :  And that is exactly what would happen if we ask it to produce an utterance ,

dialogue type : s
D :  it would be b based on that extension , ex nihilo ,

dialogue type : s
D :  which we don't know what it is ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  but it 's there .

dialogue type : s
D :  So we wouldn't even have to t to kick start it by giving it a certain intention or observing anything on the decision node .

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  And whatever that maybe that would lead to " what is the castle ? " ,

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  or " what is that whatever " .

dialogue type : s^ar
D : 

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah . So what we actually then need to do is is write a little script that changes all the settings ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  you know , go goes through all the permutations ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : qy
D :  didn't we calculate that once ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk|%-
D :  Oh ! That 's n

dialogue type : s
D :  that 's that 's nothing for those neural guys .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , they train for millions and millions of epochs .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
D :  Yeah . So , it be it it 's an idea that one could n for for example run run past , um ,

dialogue type : qw
D :  what 's that guy 's name ?

dialogue type : s
D :  You know ? He - he 's usually here .

dialogue type : x
D :  Tsk .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  J J Jer - Jerj

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  Oh , yeah . That 's the guy .

dialogue type : %--
D :  We we we we g

dialogue type : fg
D :  And um .

dialogue type : s
D :  so this is just an idea that 's floating around

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and we 'll see what happens .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And um , hmm ,

dialogue type : qw^t
D :  what other news do I have ?

dialogue type : s^t^tc
D :  Well we fixed some more things from the SmartKom system ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  but that 's not really of general interest ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Oh ! Questions ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'll ask Eva about the E Bayes and she 's working on that .

dialogue type : qw
D :  How is the generation XML thing ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  OK . No need to do it today or tomorrow even .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : %-
D :  But st

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^am
D :  Maybe .

dialogue type : qh
D :  Who knows .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  That 's good .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
D :  The paper .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  So you would say it 's funky

dialogue type : s^bu^e
D :  cool .

dialogue type : %-
D :  Well

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : qw
D :  Um , what 's your input ?

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : h|s^aap
D : 

dialogue type : s^e|qy^d^f^g
D :  It 's both , right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's it 's sort of t cognitive , neural , psycho , linguistic ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but all for the sake of doing computer science .

dialogue type : s
D :  So it 's sort of cognitive , psycho , neural , plausibly motivated , architectures of natural language processing .

dialogue type : s
D :  So it seems pretty interdisciplinary ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and I mean , w w the keynote speaker is Tomasello

dialogue type : s
D :  and blah - blah - blah ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  so ,

dialogue type : s
D :  W the the question is what could we actually do and and and keep a straight face while doing it .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  And i

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  My idea is ,

dialogue type : s
D :  well , you can say we have done a little bit

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and that 's this ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and uh sort of the rest is position paper ,

dialogue type : s
D :  " we wanna also do that " .

dialogue type : s
D :  Which is not too good .

dialogue type : s
D :  Might be more interesting to do something like let 's assume um , we 're right ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  we have as Jerry calls it , a delusion of adequacy ,

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  and take a " where is X " sentence ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and say , " we will just talk about this ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and how we cognitively , neurally , psycho - linguistically , construction grammar - ally , motivated , envision uh , understanding that " .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So we can actually show how we parse it .

dialogue type : s
D :  That should be able to we should be able to come up with , you know , a sort of a a parse .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's on ,

dialogue type : s^co
D :  just just put it on .

dialogue type : %-
D :  You don

dialogue type : s^j
D :  You will suffer in hell ,

dialogue type : s^j
D :  you know that .

dialogue type : s
D :  This is it .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Yeah , it is .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  We 're talking about this um , alleged paper that we may , just , sort of w

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  And I just sort of brought forth the idea that we take a sentence , " Where is the Powder - Tower " ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and we we p pretend to parse it ,

dialogue type : s
D :  we pretend to understand it ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and we write about it .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs^j
D :  OK , then we pretend to write about .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  There is this conference , it 's the seventh already international conference , on neu neurally , cognitively , motivated , architectures of natural language processing .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  And the keynote speakers are Tomasello , MacWhinney ?

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  We - MacWhinney , I think .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So maybe you wanna write something too .

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Even neuro .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Psycho .

dialogue type : s
D :  You could look at the web site .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  And the ad and and the deadline is the fifteenth of June .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  Hey . Plenty of time .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  It would be nice to go write two papers actually .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Yeah . And one one from your perspective , and one from our peve per per

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
D :  Well , I I also think that if we sort of write about what we have done in the past six months , we we we could sort of craft a nice little paper that if it gets rejected , which could happen , doesn't hurt

dialogue type : s^df.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^m^na

D : 

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s
D :  What to write about .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because I mean , it I don't like papers where you just talk about what you plan to do .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , it 's obvious that we can't do any kind of evaluation ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  and have no you know , we can't write an ACL type paper where we say , " OK , we 've done this

dialogue type : s^e:s|s^f
D :  and now we 're whatever percentage better than everybody else " . You know .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  It 's far too early for that .

dialogue type : s^df^rt

D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  You know , these are our , whatever , belief - net decision nodes ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and they all contribute to these things down here .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's EDU .

dialogue type : %-
D :  e e Our e e e

dialogue type : s^e
D :  You .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  We .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Us .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , in the moment it 's a Bayes - net .

dialogue type : s
D :  And it has sort of fifty not - yet - specified interfaces .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  OK . Eh I have taken care that we actually can build little interfaces , to other modules that will tell us whether the user likes these things and , n the or these things ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and he whether he 's in a wheelchair or not ,

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
D :  I think so , yeah .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Mmm . So .

dialogue type : fg|s^rt
D :  No , this is a RME core by agent design ,

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  There 's maybe a different

dialogue type : s
D :  Situation , user , d ontology .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's here .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  So this this includes the the current utterance plus all the previous utterances .

dialogue type : s
D :  And for example w i s I Irena Gurevich is going to be here eh , end of July .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  She 's a new linguist working for EML .

dialogue type : s
D :  And what she would like to do for example is great for us .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  She would like to take the ent ontolog

dialogue type : fh
D :  So ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Think of back at the EVA vector ,

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  and Johno coming up with the idea that if the person discussed the discussed the admission fee , in eh previously , that might be a good indication that , " how do I get to the castle ? " , actually he wants to enter .

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  Or , you know , " how do I get to X ? "

dialogue type : s
D :  discussing the admission fee in the previous utterance , is a good indication .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So

dialogue type : s
D :  we don't want a hard code , a set of lexemes , or things , that person 's you know , sort of filter , or uh search the discourse history .

dialogue type : s
D :  So what would be kind of cool is that if we encounter concepts that are castle , tower , bank , hotel , we run it through the ontology ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and the ontology tells us it has um , admission , opening times ,

dialogue type : s
D :  it has admission fees ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  it has this , it has that ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and then we we we make a thesaurus lexicon , look up ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and then search dynamically through the uh , discourse history for occurrences of these things in a given window of utterances .

dialogue type : s
D :  And that might , you know , give us additional input to belief A versus B .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Or E versus A .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D :  Well

dialogue type : s
D :  the the idea is even more general .

dialogue type : s
D :  The idea is to say , we encounter a certain entity in a in a in a utterance .

dialogue type : s
D :  So le let 's look up everything we the ontology gives us about that entity ,

dialogue type : s
D :  what stuff it does , what roles it has ,

dialogue type : s
D :  what parts , whatever it has .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Functions .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , then we look in the discourse , whether any of that , or any surface structure corresponding to these roles , functions aaa has ever occurred .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  And then , the discourse history can t tell us , " yeah " , or " no " .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then it 's up for us to decide what to do with it .

dialogue type : %-
D :  t So i

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  So , we may think that if you say um , " where is the theater " , um , whether or not he has talked about tickets before , then we he 's probably wanna go there to see something .

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  Or " where is the opera in Par - Paris ? ,

dialogue type : s^f
D :  yeah ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Lots of people go to the opera to take pictures of it and to look at it ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and lots of people go to attend a performance .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , the discourse can maybe tell us w what 's more likely if we know what to look for in previous statements .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  And so we can hard code " for opera , look for tickets , look for this , look for that ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  or look for Mozart , look for thi "

dialogue type : s
D :  but the smarter way is to go via the ontology

dialogue type : s
D :  and dynamically , then look up u stuff .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , e ultimately that 's also what we wanna get at .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think that 's that 's the correct way .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , of course we have to keep memory of what was the last intention ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and how does it fit to this , and what does it tell us , in terms of of the the what we 're examining .

dialogue type : s
D :  And furthermore , I mean we can idealize that , you know , people don't change topics ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  but they do .

dialogue type : s
D :  But , even th for that , there is a student of ours who 's doing a dialogue act um , recognition module .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So , maybe , we 're even in a position where we can take your approach ,

dialogue type : s.%-:qw.%-
D : 

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
D :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s^e:qw
D :  Yeah . How how do these pieces fit together ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And um .

dialogue type : s
D :  But , OK , nevertheless . So these are issues

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  but we what we actually decided last week , is to , and this is , again , for your benefit is to um , pretend we have observed and parsed an utterance such as " where is the Powder - Tower " ,

dialogue type : s
D :  or " where is the zoo " ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and specify um , what what we think the the output uh , observe , out i input nodes for our Bayes - nets for the sub sub - D , for the discourse bit , should be .

dialogue type : s
D :  So that And I will I will then come up with the ontology side uh , bits and pieces ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so that we can say , OK we we always just look at this utterance .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  That 's the only utterance we can do ,

dialogue type : s
D :  it 's hard coded ,

dialogue type : s
D :  like Srini , sort of hand parsed ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  hand crafted ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but this is what we hope to be able to observe in general from utterances , and from ontologies ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and then we can sort of fiddle with these things to see what it actually produces , in terms of output .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  So we need to find out what the " where is X " construction will give us in terms of semantics

dialogue type : s
D :  and Simspec type things .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar^fe
D :  No !

dialogue type : s^co
D :  Um , look at it this way ,

dialogue type : %--
D :  i

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw
D :  What did we decide .

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  We decided sort of the the prototypical " where is X " , where you know , we don't really know , does he wanna go there , or just wanna know where it is .

dialogue type : s^e:qw|s^f
D :  So the difference of " where is the railway station " , versus where where " where is Greenland " . Nuh ?

dialogue type : s
D :  We 're not videotaping any of this .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : %-
D :  Yea - Nnn

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  Well actually more m more the other way around .

dialogue type : s
D :  We wanted something that represents uncertainty uh we in terms of going there or just wanting to know where it is , for example .

dialogue type : s
D :  Some generic information .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so this is prototypically @ @ found in the " where is something " question , surface structure ,

dialogue type : s
D :  which can be p you know , should be maps to something that activates both .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  let 's have it fit nicely with the paper .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Yeah , we we wouldn't .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's exactly what we want .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
D :  No . We wouldn't .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Exactly .

dialogue type : qw.%--
D : 

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
D :  Yeah , it should be So we have

dialogue type : fh
D :  um ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  i let 's assume we we call something like a loc - X node and a path - X node .

dialogue type : s
D :  And what we actually get if we just look at the discourse , " where is X " should activate

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Hmm . Should be both ,

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  whereas maybe " where is X located " , we find from the data , is always just asked when the person wants to know where it is ,

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  and " how do I get to " is always asked when the person just wants to know how to get there .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  So we want to sort of come up with what gets uh , input , and how inter in case of a " where is " question .

dialogue type : qh
D :  So what what would the outcome of of your parser look like ?

dialogue type : qh
D :  And , what other discourse information from the discourse history could we hope to get , squeeze out of that utterance ?

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  So define the the input into the Bayes - net based on what the utterance , " where is X " , gives us .

dialogue type : s
D :  So definitely have an Entity node here which is activated via the ontology ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so " where is X " produces something that is s stands for X , whether it 's castle , bank , restroom , toilet , whatever .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
D :  No . Not at all .

dialogue type : s
D :  Where it is located , we have , a user proximity node here somewhere ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  e which tells us how far the user how far away the user is in respect to that uh entity .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  Yeah , you don't need to even do that .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's just sort of what what would be @ @ observed in uh in that case .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  That 's exactly what we 're looking for .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  You wouldn't .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's the same .

dialogue type : s^r
D :  It will be the same .

dialogue type : s:s|qy^d^f^g
D :  So I think r in here we have " I 'll go there " , right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  And we have our Info - on .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  So in my c my case , this would sort of make this happy , and this would make the Go - there happy .

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  What you 're saying is we have a Where - X question , Where - X node , that makes both happy .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's what you 're proposing , which is , in my mind

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  just as fine .

dialogue type : s
D :  So w if we have a construction node , " where is X " , it 's gonna both get the po posterior probability that it 's Info - on up ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Info - on is True - up , and that Go - there is True - up , as well .

dialogue type : s
D :  Which would be exactly analogous to what I 'm proposing is , this makes uh makes something here true ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and this makes something also something here true ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and this makes this True - up , and this makes this True - up as well .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df
D :  Yeah , because we get we get tons of constructions I think .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because , you know , mmm people have many ways of asking for the same thing ,

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^nd|s^ar
D :  The system doesn't massage you , no . No .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah . Precisely .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : %-
D :  So , w

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  Exactly . We have su we have specified two .

dialogue type : s
D :  OK , the next one would be here , just for mood .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  The next one would be what we can squeeze out of the uh

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  I don't know , maybe we wanna observe the uh , um , uh the length of of the words used , and , or the prosody

dialogue type : s
D :  and g a and t make conclusions about the user 's intelligence .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : b
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  U that 's exactly r um , why I 'm proposing It 's too early to have to think of them of all of these discourse things that one could possibly observe ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  so let 's just assume

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  human beings are not allowed to ask anything but " where is X " .

dialogue type : s
D :  This is the only utterance in the world .

dialogue type : qh
D :  What could we observe from that ?

dialogue type : %-
D :  In ter

dialogue type : s
D :  Just just " where is X " .

dialogue type : s:qy|qy^d^f^g
D :  And , but you know , do it do it in such a way that we know that people can also say , " is the town hall in front of the bank " , so that we need something like a w WH focus . Nuh ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , if you if you can , oh definitely do ,

dialogue type : s^m^na|qy^d^f^g
D :  where possible . Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  If i if if it 's not at all triggered by our thing , then it 's irrelevant ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and it doesn't hurt to leave it out for the moment .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bd
D :  Think Uh , well this is just a mental exercise .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  If you think about ,

dialogue type : s^cs:qw
D :  focus on this question , how would you design that ?

dialogue type : qy
D :  Is it do you feel confident about saying this is part of the language already to to detect those plans ,

dialogue type : qh
D :  and why would anyone care about location ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  if not , you know

dialogue type : s
D :  and so forth .

dialogue type : qrr.%--
D :  Or do you actually ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean this is perfectly legitimate ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I I would not have any problems with erasing this

dialogue type : s:s
D :  and say , that 's all we can activate , based on the utterance out of context .

dialogue type : qw
D :  What ?

dialogue type : s:s
D :  And then the the the miracle that we get out the intention , Go - there , happens , based on what we know about that entity , about the user , about his various beliefs , goals , desires , blah - blah - blah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Absolutely fine .

dialogue type : s
D :  But this is the sort of thing , I I propose that we think about ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  so that we actually end up with um , um , nodes for the discourse and ontology

dialogue type : s
D :  so that we can put them into our Bayes - net ,

dialogue type : s
D :  never change them ,

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  so we all there is is " where is X " ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and , Eva can play around with the observed things ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and we can run our better JavaBayes , and have it produce some output .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  And for the first time in th in in the world , we look at our output ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and um and see uh whether it it 's any good .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  You know ?

dialogue type : fh
D :  I mean ,

dialogue type : qw^br
D :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df
D :  Yeah , I I mean , for me this is just a ba matter of curiosity ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I wanna would like to look at uh , what this ad - hoc process of designing a belief - net would actually produce .

dialogue type : s^e:qw
D :  If if we ask it where is something .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , maybe it also h enables you to think about certain things more specifically ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  um , come up with interesting questions , to which you can find interesting answers .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , additionally it might fit in really nicely with the paper .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because if if if we want an example for the paper , I suggest there it is .

dialogue type : s
D :  So th this might be a nice opening paragraph for the paper as saying , " you know people look at kinds of at ambiguities " ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  and um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  in the literature there 's " bank "

dialogue type : s
D :  and whatever kinds of garden path phenomenon .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  And we can say , well , that 's all nonsense . A ,

dialogue type : s
D :  A , uh these things are never really ambiguous in discourse , B ,

dialogue type : s
D :  B , don't ever occur really in discourse ,

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  but normal statements that seem completely unambiguous , such as " where is the blah - blah " , actually are terribly complex , and completely ambiguous .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so , what every everybody else has been doing so far in in in you know , has been completely nonsensical , and can all go into the wastepaper bin ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Nice overture ,

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bd
D :  OK , I 'm eja exaggerating ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  but that might be , you know , saying " hey " , you know , some stuff is is actually complex , if you look at it in in in the vacuum

dialogue type : s
D :  and and ceases to be complex in reality .

dialogue type : s
D :  And some stuff that 's as that 's absolutely straightforward in the vacuum , is actually terribly complex in reality .

dialogue type : s
D :  Would be nice sort of , uh , also , nice , um bottom - up linguistics , um , type message .

dialogue type : s
D :  Versus the old top - down school .

dialogue type : s^tc
D :  I 'm running out of time .

dialogue type : fg
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  At four ten .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
D :  OK , this is the other bit of news .

dialogue type : s
D :  The subjects today know Fey ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so she can't be here , and do the wizarding .

dialogue type : s
D :  So I 'm gonna do the wizarding

dialogue type : s
D :  and Thilo 's gonna do the instructing .

dialogue type : s
D :  Also we 're getting a a person who just got fired uh , from her job .

dialogue type : s
D :  Uh a person from Oakland who is interested in maybe continuing the wizard bit once Fey leaves in August .

dialogue type : s
D :  And um , she 's gonna look at it today .

dialogue type : s
D :  Which is good news in the sense that if we want to continue , after the thir thir after July , we can .

dialogue type : s^bsc
D :  We could .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  and that 's also maybe interesting for Keith and whoever , if you wanna get some more stuff into the data collection .

dialogue type : s
D :  Remember this , we can completely change the set - up any time we want .

dialogue type : s
D :  Look at the results we 've gotten so far for the first , whatever , fifty some subjects ?

dialogue type : s^ar|s
D :  No , we 're approaching twenty now .

dialogue type : s
D :  But , until Fey is leaving , we surely will hit the some of the higher numbers .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so that 's cool .

dialogue type : s
D :  Can a do more funky stuff .

dialogue type : h
D :  Um .

dialogue type : s
D :  We have uh , eh found someone here who 's hand st hand transcribing the first twelve .

dialogue type : s^e^rt
D :  First dozen subjects

dialogue type : s
D :  just so we can build a a language model for the recognizer .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  But , um So those should be available soon .

dialogue type : s
D :  The first twelve .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And
