dialogue type : z
A :  Hey , you 're not supposed to be drinking in here dude .

dialogue type : z
A :  Do we have to read them that slowly ?

dialogue type : z
A :  OK .

dialogue type : z
A :  Sounded like a robot .

dialogue type : z
A :  Um , this is t

dialogue type : z
A :  When you read the numbers it kind of reminded me of beat poetry .

dialogue type : z
A :  Three three six zero zero .

dialogue type : z
A :  Four two zero zero

dialogue type : z
A :  one seven .

dialogue type : z
A :  That 's what I think of when I think of beat poetry .

dialogue type : z
A :  You ever seen " So I married an axe murderer " ?

dialogue type : z
A :  There 's a part wh there 's parts when he 's doing beat poetry .

dialogue type : z
A :  And he talks like that .

dialogue type : z
A :  That 's why I thi

dialogue type : z
A :  That uh probably is why I think of it that way .

dialogue type : z
A :  Mike Meyers is the guy .

dialogue type : z
A :  It - it 's his uh it 's his cute romantic comedy .

dialogue type : z
A : 

dialogue type : z
A :  That 's his cute romantic comedy , yeah .

dialogue type : z
A :  The other thing that 's real funny , I 'll spoil it for you .

dialogue type : z
A :  is when he 's he works in a coffee shop ,

dialogue type : z
A :  in San Francisco ,

dialogue type : z
A :  and uh he 's sitting there on this couch and they bring him this massive cup of espresso ,

dialogue type : z
A :  and he 's like " excuse me I ordered the large espresso ? "

dialogue type : z
A : 

dialogue type : z
A :  do are y

dialogue type : z
A :  So you 're trying to decide who 's the best taster of tiramisu ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Ah .

dialogue type : z
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : z
A : 

dialogue type : z
A :  Seems like you could put a s magic special ingredient in , so that everyone know which one was yours .

dialogue type : z
A : 

dialogue type : z
A :  Well , I 'm going back to visit my parents this weekend ,

dialogue type : z
A :  so , I 'll be out of town .

dialogue type : z
A :  No , the South Bay ,

dialogue type : z
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : z
A :  We are .

dialogue type : z
A :  Is Nancy s uh gonna show up ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : z
A :  Wonder if these things ever emit a very , like , piercing screech right in your ear ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is she mispronouncing " Anlage " ?

dialogue type : qy
A :  Is it " Anlaga " or " Anlunga "

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
A :  I wasn't wasn't sure whether wizard was the correct term for uh " not a man " .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
A :  Are you sure ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  Yeah , that 's so @ @ .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , what I did for this this is uh , a pedagogical belief - net

dialogue type : s^df
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I made these dummy nodes called Trajector - In and Trajector - Out that would isolate the things related to the trajector .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then there were the things with the source and the path and the goal .

dialogue type : s
A :  And I separated them out .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then I um did similar things for our our net to uh with the context and the discourse and whatnot ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um , so we could sort of isolate them or whatever in terms of the the top layer .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then the bottom layer is just the Mode .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  So basically all I did was I took the last belief - net

dialogue type : s
A :  and I grouped things according to what how I thought they would fit in to uh image schemas that would be related .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the two that I came up with were Trajector - landmark and then Source - path - goal as initial ones .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then I said well , uh the trajector would be the person in this case probably .

dialogue type : h|s
A :  Um , you know , we have we have the concept of what their intention was , whether they were trying to tour or do business or whatever ,

dialogue type : s
A :  or they were hurried .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's kind of related to that .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bc
A :  Oh actually , I kind of , I might have added these cuz I don't think we talked too much about the source in the old one

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bc
A :  or the " landmark - iness " of where I 'm currently at .

dialogue type : s
A :  And " usefulness " is basi basically means is that an institutional facility like a town hall or something like that that 's not something that you 'd visit for tourist 's tourism 's sake or whatever .

dialogue type : s
A :  " Travel constraints " would be something like you know , maybe they said they can they only wanna take a bus or something like that ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s
A :  And then those are somewhat related to the path ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  so that would determine whether we 'd could take we would be telling them to go to the bus stop or versus walking there directly .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , " Goal " .

dialogue type : s
A :  Similar things as the source except they also added whether the entity was closed

dialogue type : s
A :  and whether they have somehow marked that is was the final destination .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A :  Um , and then if you go up ,

dialogue type : s
A :  Robert ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Yeah , so um , in terms of Context , what we had currently said was whether they were a businessman or a tourist of some other person .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , Discourse was related to whether they had asked about open hours

dialogue type : s
A :  or whether they asked about where the entrance was or the admission fee , or something along those lines .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
A :  Uh , Prosody I don't really I 'm not really sure what prosody means , in this context ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so I just made up you know whether whether what they say is or h how they say it is is that .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , the Parse would be what verb they chose ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and then maybe how they modified it , in the sense of whether they said " I need to get there quickly " or whatever .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  And um , in terms of World Knowledge , this would just basically be like opening and closing times of things , the time of day it is , and whatnot .

dialogue type : s^m.%--
A :  Tourbook ?

dialogue type : s
A :  That would be , I don't know , the " landmark - iness " of things ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  whether it 's in the tourbook or not .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , this is not a working Bayes - net .

dialogue type : s^nd.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^co
A :  Say what you were gonna say .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^nd.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  So we 'd have to get rid of this and connect these things directly to the Mode .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Cuz I don't understand how it would work otherwise .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Well I oh yeah , I unders I understand that ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I just uh it 's hard for me to imagine how he could get around that .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , these wouldn't be the summary nodes .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  We 'd have the summary nodes like

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  So what I kind of need to do is to take this one and the old one and merge them together ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  We could actually , y yeah draw it in a different way , in the sense that it would make it more abstract .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  so what we 'd be generating would be a reference to a semantic uh like parameters for the for the X - schema ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qh
A :  Right and then , once we 've made the decision , how do we put that into the content ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  There 's just too many factors right now .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
A :  So what we really wanna do i

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
A :  cuz this is really just the three layer net , we wanna b make it expand it out into more layers basically ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  So instead of in instead it should really be just be " intention " as a node instead of " intention business " or " intention tour " .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  I think what was going through my mind when I did it was someone could both have a business intention and a touring intention

dialogue type : fh
A :  and

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : sj^nd.%--
A : 

dialogue type : sj.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .
