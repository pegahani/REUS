dialogue type : s^aa|qy^cs.%-
G :  Yeah , why don't you summarize the

dialogue type : s^e
G :  And I guess that includes some the filtering for the , the ASI refs , too .

dialogue type : s
G :  For the references that we need to go from the the fancy transcripts to the sort of brain - dead .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  With Don , as well .

dialogue type : qw
G :  What do you mean , the prosodics ?

dialogue type : qw
G :  So what are they doing in Aurora ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  are they reading actual phone numbers ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
G :  or , a a digit at a time , or ?

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk^m
G :  Connected .

dialogue type : s
G :  So there 's also the not just the prosody but the cross the cross - word modeling is probably quite different .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's the beginning of time in speech recognition .

dialogue type : s^j
G :  It 's like the , single cell , you know , it 's the beginning of life ,

dialogue type : b
G :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well it 's definitely true that , when people are , reading , even if they 're re - reading what , they had said spontaneously , that they have very different patterns .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  Mitch showed that , and some , dissertations have shown that .

dialogue type : s
G :  So the fact that they 're reading , first of all , whether they 're reading in a room of , people , or rea you know , just the fact that they 're reading will make a difference .

dialogue type : s
G :  And , depends what you 're interested in .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
G :  Well it 's also , there 's , really a difference between , the pronunciation models in the dictionary , and , the pronunciations that people produce .

dialogue type : s
G :  And , so , You get , some of that information from Steve 's work on the on the labeling

dialogue type : %--
G :  and it really ,

dialogue type : sj^cs
G :  I actually think that data should be used more .

dialogue type : s
G :  That maybe , although I think the meeting context is great , that he has transcriptions that give you the actual phone sequence .

dialogue type : sj
G :  And you can go from not from that to the articulatory features , but that would be a better starting point for marking , the gestural features , then , data where you don't have that ,

dialogue type : s
G :  because , we you wanna know , both about the way that they 're producing a certain sound , and what kinds of , you know what kinds of , phonemic , differences you get between these , transcribed , sequences and the dictionary ones .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
G :  But Right .

dialogue type : s^nd^tc
G :  But it still is there 's a there are two steps .

dialogue type : s
G :  One you know , one is going from a dictionary pronunciation of something , like , " gonna see you tomorrow " ,

dialogue type : s
G :  it could be " going to " or " gonna " or " gonta s " you know .

dialogue type : fh
G :  And , yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  " Gonna see you tomorrow " , uh , " guh see you tomorrow " .

dialogue type : sj^cs
G :  And , that it would be nice to have these , intermediate , or these some these reduced pronunciations that those transcribers had marked or to have people mark those as well .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Because , it 's not , um , that easy to go from the , dictionary , word pronuncia the dictionary phone pronunciation , to the gestural one without this intermediate or a syllable level kind of , representation .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  It depends how you look at it , and

dialogue type : s
G :  I I understand what you 're saying about this , kind of transcription exactly ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because I 've seen you know , where does the voicing bar start and so forth .

dialogue type : s
G :  All I 'm saying is that , it is useful to have that the transcription of what was really said , and which syllables were reduced .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
G :  Uh , if you 're gonna add the features

dialogue type : s
G :  it 's also useful to have some level of representation which is , is a reduced it 's a pronunciation variant , that currently the dictionaries don't give you

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because if you add them to the dictionary and you run recognition , you , you add confusion .

dialogue type : s
G :  So people purposely don't add them .

dialogue type : s
G :  So it 's useful to know which variant was was produced , at least at the phone level .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s
G :  That 's all , I mean .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
G :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  And Steve 's type is fairly it 's not that slow ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  uh , uh ,

dialogue type : s^no.%--
G :  I dunno exactly what the , timing was , but .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  an and in some places it would fill in , So the kinds of gestural features are not everywhere .

dialogue type : s
G :  So there are some things that you don't have access to either from your ear or the spectrogram ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but you know what phone it was and that 's about all you can all you can say .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b.x
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^arp
G :  You can add the features in , uh , but it 'll be underspecified .

dialogue type : s
G :  Th - there 'll be no way for you to actually mark what was said completely by features .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^arp^tc
G :  Well , we we 've probably have a separate , um , discussion of , uh of whether you can do that .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
G :  Yeah that that 's all I was thinking about .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b^rt
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  the problem is when you run , uh , if you run a regular dictionary , um , even if you have variants , in there , which most people don't , you don't always get , out , the actual pronunciations ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  so that 's why the human transcriber 's giving you the that pronunciation ,

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  and so y

dialogue type : sj^na
G : 

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
G :  we should catch up on what Steve is ,

dialogue type : h|sj
G :  uh I think that would be a good i good idea .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : sj^cs.%-
G :  I was thinking it might be n

dialogue type : sj^cs^rt
G :  Well it might be neat to do some , phonetic , features on these , nonword words .

dialogue type : qy^e
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G :  These k No , I 'm serious .

dialogue type : s
G :  There are all these kinds of functional , uh , elements .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I don't know what you call them .

dialogue type : s
G :  But not just fill pauses but all kinds of ways of interrupting and so forth .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  And some of them are , yeah , " uh - huh "s , and " hmm "s , and , " hmm ! "

dialogue type : s^e
G :  " hmm " " OK " , " uh " Grunts ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  uh ,

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  that might be interesting .

dialogue type : s^e.x
G :  In the meetings .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  we haven't done this yet because , um , uh , Andreas an is is gonna move over the SRI recognizer .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  i basically I ran out of machines at SRI ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  cuz we 're running the evals

dialogue type : s^df
G :  and I just don't have machine time there .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  But , once that 's moved over , uh , hopefully in a a couple days , then , we can take , um , what Jane just told us about as , the presegmented , the the segmentations that you did , at level eight or som at some , threshold that Jane , tha right , and try doing , forced alignment . um , on the word strings .

dialogue type : s
G :  And if it 's good , then that will that may give you a good boundary .

dialogue type : s
G :  Of course if it 's good , we don't then we 're we 're fine ,

dialogue type : s^no
G :  but , I don't know yet whether these , segments that contain a lot of pauses around the words , will work or not .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^am
G :  They might be OK .

dialogue type : s
G :  It you know it really depends on a lot of things ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but , I would have maybe a transciber , uh , look at the result of a forced alignment and then adjust those .

dialogue type : s
G :  That might save some time .

dialogue type : s
G :  If they 're horrible it won't help at all ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but they might not be horrible .

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  So but I 'll let you know when we , uh , have that .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Are the , um , wireless , different than the wired , mikes , at all ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  I mean , have you noticed any difference ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
G :  So it 's just the lapel versus everything else ?

dialogue type : s
G :  We 're gonna be recording them every Monday ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So they 're really running out of , data , prett I mean that 's good .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Um , OK .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^t3
G :  Yeah , please .

dialogue type : s^co
G :  Go ahead .

dialogue type : s^2
G :  And this afternoon .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Yeah we j we just needed a way to , strip , you know , all the comments , all the things th the that linguist wants but the recognizer can't do anything with .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  Um , but to keep things that we mapped to like reject models , or , you know , uh , mouth noise , or , cough .

dialogue type : s
G :  And then there 's this interesting issue Jane brought up

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which I hadn't thought about before

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  but I was , realizing as I went through the transcripts , that there are some noises like ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  um ,

dialogue type : s
G :  well the good example was an inbreath , where a transcriber working from , the mixed , signal , doesn't know whose breath it is ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and they 've been assigning it to someone that may or may not be correct .

dialogue type : s
G :  And what we do is , if it 's a breath sound , you know , a sound from the speaker , we map it , to , a noise model , like a mouth - noise model in the recognizer ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and , yeah , it probably doesn't hurt that much once in a while to have these ,

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  but , if they 're in the wrong channel , that 's , not a good idea .

dialogue type : s
G :  And then there 's also , things like door - slams that 's really in no one 's channel ,

dialogue type : s
G :  they 're like it 's in the room .

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  And uh , Jane had this nice , uh , idea of having , like an extra , uh couple tiers ,

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  And we were thinking , that is useful also when there 's uncertainties .

dialogue type : s
G :  So if they hear a breath and they don't know who breath it is it 's better to put it in that channel than to put it in the speaker 's channel

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because maybe it was someone else 's breath ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  or Uh ,

dialogue type : s
G :  so I think that 's a good you can always clean that up , post - processing .

dialogue type : s
G :  So a lot of little details ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but I think we 're , coming to some kinda closure , on that .

dialogue type : s
G :  So the idea is then , uh , Don can take , uh , Jane 's post - processed channelized version , and , with some scripts , you know , convert that to to a reference for the recognizer

dialogue type : s
G :  and we can , can run these .

dialogue type : s
G :  So when that 's , ready you know , as soon as that 's ready , and as soon as the recognizer is here we can get , twelve hours of force - aligned and recognized data .

dialogue type : s
G :  And , you know , start , working on it ,

dialogue type : s
G :  so we 're , I dunno a coup a week or two away I would say from ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  uh , if if that process is automatic once we get your post - process , transcript .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^ba
G :  Yeah , some of them are quite long .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I dunno

dialogue type : qw.%-
G : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d.%-
G :  you did one ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Right . It 's not the it 's not the fact that we can't process a twenty second segment , it 's the fact that , there 's twenty seconds in which to place one word in the wrong place

dialogue type : s^e
G :  You know , if if someone has a very short utterance there ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and that 's where , we , might wanna have this individual , you know , ha have your pre pre - process input .

dialogue type : s^bd^no
G :  And I just don't know ,

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  I have to run it .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s
G :  So that 's probably what will happen ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but we 'll try it this way and see .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  I mean it 's probably good enough for force - alignment .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  If it 's not then we 're really then we def definitely

dialogue type : s
G :  uh , but for free recognition I 'm it 'll probably not be good enough .

dialogue type : s
G :  We 'll probably get lots of errors because of the cross - talk , and , noises and things .

dialogue type : qw
G :  So what happens to our old microphones ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Do we give them to someone ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
G :  or ?

dialogue type : s
G :  We don't have more receivers ,

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2^m
G :  Just the lapel itself .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s
G :  However , he may be solicited after these meetings are distributed .

dialogue type : s^co^j
G :  Don't worry about finishing your dissertation .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yes .

dialogue type : z
G :  Huh .
