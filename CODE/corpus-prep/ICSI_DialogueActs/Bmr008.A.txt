dialogue type : z
A :  Yeah , I do it My head 's too big , also .

dialogue type : z
A :  It 's too ba

dialogue type : z
A :  Oh , that 's true .

dialogue type : z
A :  course that 's true of a lapel as well .

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt
A :  Can you just write something like " position " ?

dialogue type : s^cs^e
A :  and people can fill in their own you know , " Post - doc " or " visitor " or whatever .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  oh .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Can you repeat the categories you had ?

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Maybe they 're fine .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^arp.%--
A :  So that , yeah , I think that 's fine except the one thing is there are a lot of ICSI v

dialogue type : s^no
A :  like I don't know what I would be here ,

dialogue type : s
A :  just I 'm not a professor

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So so anything that , like a Visitor r ICSI Visitor or , ICSI y

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean a Visiting S Researcher or whatever .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
A : 

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Yeah , that then then I think what you have is great .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^co|qw
A :  Wait , what 's a PHD ?

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Like , if you have a PHD and you 're hanging around here , and you 're not a professor and you 're not a post - doc , then that 's like what we are so There 's a bunch of people like that .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , you can say Post - PHD Researcher or what if there 's one more category that 's sort of general like that .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  You - I think you could keep Professor , but you could say Post PHD Researcher or something .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^cs
A :  No , instead of Post Post - doc or Post - PHD , just wrap all the people that are post PHD and non - professors together .

dialogue type : s
A :  I think professors probably want it

dialogue type : s
A :  I don't care .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , yeah the Post - PHD one is the one that can be , like Post - Post - doc or Post - PHD Researcher or whatever .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba^rt
A :  Then it 'd be fine .

dialogue type : s^r^t1
A :  I think it 's fine .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  Wait , why is that optional ?

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  It it would be very good to get age for a lot of purposes .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fg|qo^rt
A :  yeah , so we ca we have these age ranges or something ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  No , not at all ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  every most corpora have that , you know , information .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  yeah , that 's OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  Age or Approximate Age .

dialogue type : s
A :  So somebody can say " thirties " if they 're thirty - nine .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , those who don't give it we will be estimating your age for you

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I I think people in Speech are gonna wanna

dialogue type : s
A :  They can always lie .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs^rt
A :  OK , in some sense you could say that " Please leave blank but but don't lie . "

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well they might leave it blank if they didn't care about their age being known but it says " optional " they might not .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Anyway , it 's fine

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Yeah , it 's OK .

dialogue type : s^co
A :  As long as we put it high enough up that it doesn't sort of get lost in the optional , if there are a lot of other optional things on the form .

dialogue type : s^bs
A :  That 's that 's the only optional thing ,

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  So what does Region mean

dialogue type : s
A :  and like if I see this form I wouldn't be quite sure what you mean by Region .

dialogue type : qr.%--
A :  Do you want to have give choices and have them circle one , or ,

dialogue type : %-
A :  I mean

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  but I mean .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df
A :  yeah maybe not for the others , because there aren't going to be enough people to really group them

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : s^t1.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I I there are huge differences you know in the others

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A :  so it might be better to just do it for the

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  yeah you could leave region for for the others but have circled choice for the American English .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Actually that is true for them

dialogue type : s^arp^df
A :  but it means that you 're gonna get a bunch of different level levels of resolution in your survey , it it 'll be more of a pain later ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : s
A :  It depends .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , that that 's good

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A :  but if you have it totally free - form First of all some people take you

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  Well , and some people would give you more specific information than others

dialogue type : s^df^ng
A :  and that 's a waste because you can only use the least common denominator of specificity and generally .

dialogue type : s^no^rt
A :  I don't know

dialogue type : s
A :  later on , if if somebody just says Midwest , now all these other people who said you know area then that 'll have to become your category .

dialogue type : s
A :  and it 's It 's harder later on , i I It 's easier for the person

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  but it 's harder for the r

dialogue type : s
A :  it actually less informative for us

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because you can't enforce any minimum level of specificity .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^e.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^r.%-
A : 

dialogue type : qh
A :  If we release this corpus , what do we want ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean if you do this free form um the free form solution where some questions are very open - ended then you need someone needs to enter that ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and they 'll be notes and it will be very difficult for somebody later actually use that without mapping it .

dialogue type : sj^ba^df^rt
A :  It 's OK .

dialogue type : s^arp.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  So we want some rough idea of their dialect , basically .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  then we should have some question where it 's not free form , except for these people who are who have non - American English accents .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  There we probably have to have a category " Non - American English " and then a few choices .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  cuz a lot of times if you give the data out that 's what people are gonna use .

dialogue type : s
A :  They 're gonna want some small set of places ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  and then , but anything additional people can fill out , and we can put it in as a note or something ,

dialogue type : s:s
A :  but if we don't have that , someone 's gotta sit there and figure out you know , I 've got twenty people who said Midwest ,

dialogue type : s:s
A :  and I 've got a few people who said something else

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  and these don't overlap or these

dialogue type : s^bk|fg.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^arp
A :  Well , in the home , the influence of the home is much lower age than that ,

dialogue type : s^df^e.%-
A :  I mean once you go beyond the age five or six then it 's the the school influence as well and and

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so In the home it 's sort of your phonetic first level ,

dialogue type : s
A :  um a - So it 's you know it starts to get sort of complicated .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^df^nd
A :  Most of but most of those people don't rely on the self - evaluations , anyway .

dialogue type : s
A :  They 'll probably listen to the speech ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  They have information sort of like TIMIT

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know it 's how well they categorized ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean most of the people from cer certain places in the South were from specific Texas locations ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  You know , people would say Boston , and they had nothing like what I would call a Boston accent .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : h|s^nd
A :  Um No , the question was really geared towards trying to get people 's self - evaluation of their dialect region .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  these were all settled by very different type people ,

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  so it it 's sort of a general help

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but I think that anyone who 's doing phonetics wouldn't rely on that , they would probably use it as a first pass or something ,

dialogue type : s^arp.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aap^cs
A :  but we don't need to ha be really really specific about the others , because it won't be very w helpful anyway .

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  I think we should , because other databases do .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  It 's sort of a political thing .

dialogue type : sj^ba.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  like , you will find more New Yorkers in the New York category .

dialogue type : sj.%-
A :  but it 's not

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  But Other is there , and people will fill that out .

dialogue type : s
A :  They 'll see by example .

dialogue type : s^aa^rt|sj^ba
A :  Yeah that 's I think that 's fine ,

dialogue type : s:s
A :  they 'll say oh , I 'm not one of these ,

dialogue type : s.%--:s.%--
A :  I 'm Canadian , or

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  We could ask them for more information , but I don't think it 's necessary and it 's not going to solve this problem .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I mean , I think the question on regions is really to ask people how did they define their dialect region now ,

dialogue type : %--
A :  di

dialogue type : s
A :  the whether they picked it up at the one age or another .

dialogue type : sj
A :  pretty much , I mean , most people will know whether they have a southern accent or not .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um , but they may have lived you know , in other places , too .

dialogue type : s
A :  So if we ask the question about dialect regions , it makes no sense to say where do you live now .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^cs:qw
A :  You ask how would you best define your your accent or your dialect style .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK

dialogue type : s^cs:qw
A :  Or you could say to somebody , how do you define your your the accent that you have .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um And then you can ask these other questions as well ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but what we don't want them to think is that they 're living in a certain place

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , nowadays hardly anybody from California has a native Californian accent ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
A :  as long as it 's clear .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Sounds good .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Sounds good .

dialogue type : s
A :  It it gets into a can of worms .

dialogue type : sj^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  What about proficiency in English ? as well ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
A :  You don't want to do it for political reasons ,

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean I 'm no I wasn't thinking about that ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  I was just thinking , " Gee , I 'd like to know actually "

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : sj.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Maybe we maybe we shouldn't ask it ,

dialogue type : s^bd^no
A :  I don't know .

dialogue type : qw^cs:qw
A :  What about something like " How comfortable are you in a meeting conducted in English ? " ,

dialogue type : qrr^cs:qw
A :  or " How easy is it for you ? " ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|sj^ba
A :  Yeah , that 's a good one .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : qo
A :  wha what do you think ,

dialogue type : qw.%--
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : qw.%-
A : 

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
A :  yeah ?

dialogue type : s^bu:qw
A :  How long have you been in an English speaking country .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  How about their birthday ?

dialogue type : s^bd^no
A :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , not not the year not the year

dialogue type : s
A :  not the year but just their birthday .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : qw
A :  what are the chances of people having the same name .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  So thi Isn't this an open - ended , like basically a notes column ?

dialogue type : sj.%-
A : 

dialogue type : qr
A :  is this the the place where we would do that , or is there another place .

dialogue type : sj
A :  I think that starts to There 's definitely some clear cases ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but there are a lot of gray areas , where the context happens just in that meeting ,

dialogue type : %--
A :  or ,

dialogue type : sj.%--
A :  I mean , where you don't wanna sort of have to make a distinction between a pre - existing relationship , or

dialogue type : s^df
A :  But I mean , there are some that generalize over many meetings and there are some that don't , and there are some things that happen in between meetings ,

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I think this one needs to be open - ended ,

dialogue type : s^e^r
A :  completely open - ended ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and the only concern I would have is if there 's something we wanna be able to say and we can't put it in that field .

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
A : 

dialogue type : qy.%--
A :  Is there a way that we can add keywords or sub

dialogue type : qy^d
A :  I don't know what you would call them , but little labels for things that we decide are useful things to have

dialogue type : sj
A :  but You know , as long as we have this one place where it can all be stored , then we 're fine , I think .

dialogue type : s
A :  and those 'll probably occur I mean , to us , we 'll think of a few of them , some other researcher will think of some totally different keyword .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's gonna change ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
A :  and maybe we wanna regroup things under different labels later ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  But are we assuming that you could know the energy for a speaker when there 's no overlap ?

dialogue type : s.%--:s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s:s
A :  it 's cheating ,

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
A :  but not completely if they 're often not overlapping and normalized for the speaker

dialogue type : qrr
A :  or is that not allowed .

dialogue type : qw.%--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  right

dialogue type : b
A :  right

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right , right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  That 's what makes it seem difficult ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because you 're already left with a high standard deviation

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  and they 're already roughly

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  so that each person 's hearable ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  so sort of equally loud , perceptually anyway .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah , like two hundred milliseconds

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  or twenty to twenty - five frames ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  or

dialogue type : s
A :  or voiced regions ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  I mean can we tell ?

dialogue type : qr^rt
A :  can we sorry I mean , is it known whether something 's voiced here , or is it roughly estimate estimateable ?

dialogue type : qy
A :  I mean like if one speaker 's voicing and the other one isn't and they 're overlapping , do we know that the first speaker 's voicing , or not ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy
A :  But will we be able t to detect the voicing when there 's overlap ?

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's what I just wondered .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  So if we could , or if you could do some of it ,

dialogue type : b
A :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s
A :  then um , voiced regions would be , like , probably more informative , for energy

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and pi and pitch for that matter .

dialogue type : s^t3
A :  Well , it 's the fifth page , I guess .

dialogue type : s
A :  It has to tell you .

dialogue type : s
A :  It has to give you at least a zero , one ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm , mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  You can also look at just the voiced regions later .

dialogue type : s^ba^df
A :  I mean , that would be the most sensitive measure .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  you know if you normalize but you look everywhere at at at fricatives or something you won't really know anything .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I mean assuming if it 's true that the overlap regions are sort of long enough that there 's some voicing in each of them , by each of the speakers , then you should do very well if you do this .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  But you 'll only know that in the re voiced regions

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  You know , there 's enough voicing going on and off uh that if you can capture the voicing and if you can capture it when there 's overlap then you should do quite well there .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I think also the harmonics would be very important .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  You know , if you have two speakers and they 're both voicing

dialogue type : s
A :  unless they have very similar , you know , pitch , you should be able to see the difference in harmonics pretty clearly

dialogue type : s
A :  just by counting them ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  I mean

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  yeah , so even if you 're not exactly sure when the overlap starts and ends because there 's some non - voiced regions , at least you can have these islands of reliability where you 're pretty sure .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  and you could put an estimate estimate , you know , a fuzzy start and end time .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , it 's sort of good , though , if you 're for for your accuracy .

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , Gives you a little more time to try to detect them .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  somethin something like that

dialogue type : s
A :  too .
