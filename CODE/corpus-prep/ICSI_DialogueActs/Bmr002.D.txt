dialogue type : z
D :  Well

dialogue type : z
D :  Write down that poem .

dialogue type : z
D :  Let us know when you 're done , though

dialogue type : z
D :  cuz we want to start the meeting .

dialogue type : z
D :  Now , how do you do the mike ?

dialogue type : z
D :  I keep getting it in my nose .

dialogue type : z
D :  Oh !

dialogue type : z
D :  Oh ! This is good .

dialogue type : z
D :  Oh ! I like this .

dialogue type : z
D :  I like this .

dialogue type : z
D :  I like this ,

dialogue type : z
D :  this is much more comfortable .

dialogue type : z
D :  I could have it more at the midline .

dialogue type : z
D :  Boy ! It 's very adjustable now .

dialogue type : z
D :  I 'm on number four .

dialogue type : z
D :  May I pass the folder to Dan ?

dialogue type : z
D :  OK .

dialogue type : z
D :  I 'm mike I 'm on mike four .

dialogue type : z
D :  and it 's a very nice microphone ,

dialogue type : z
D :  very modern .

dialogue type : z
D :  I like it very much .

dialogue type : z
D :  You didn't get the s head restraint with your system ?

dialogue type : z
D :  I did modify my my mike uh distance from my speaking apparatus .

dialogue type : z
D :  Slightly .

dialogue type : z
D :  That 's a good way .

dialogue type : z
D :  Should I draw a map ?

dialogue type : z
D :  OK .

dialogue type : z
D :  He 's labelling he 's labelling right now .

dialogue type : z
D :  Now .

dialogue type : z
D :  OK .

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  We have what ? What do we have ?

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Well done .

dialogue type : s^ba^r
D :  Well done .

dialogue type : s^tc
D :  You 're probably wondering why I brought you all here today .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Good .

dialogue type : qy.%-
D :  Shall I n

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Yeah , I 'd like to hear one more .

dialogue type : qy^co^rt^t
D :  Could I hear you next ?

dialogue type : fg
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , basically they 're kind of like sentences but with n numbers instead of words .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So , I 'm I 'm on uh number four with the microphone around my neck

dialogue type : s^cc^rt
D :  and I will read these .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  It really sounds like sentences .

dialogue type : s
D :  Your intonation sounds like somewhat like sentence intonation .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  If I were to be dictating a phone number , I would have done that more slowly ,

dialogue type : fh|s^df
D :  but uh which would have been easier for the of course , for the machine .

dialogue type : fh|qy^rt
D :  But . Was that an OK pace ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  Just as long as it 's with you know , uh within the constraints .

dialogue type : s
D :  Number four .

dialogue type : s^fa^t3
D :  Oh , Sorry .

dialogue type : s^2^j^rt
D :  and the voice .

dialogue type : s^j
D :  Just no way .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , you did .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : h|s
D :  Um , because my name was was mentioned when I wasn't around ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I 'm most happy .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Oh , uh he did .

dialogue type : s
D :  and and I approved .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  but I think that I was uh proposed before I was asked ?

dialogue type : s
D :  And that doesn't matter

dialogue type : s
D :  cuz I think there was probably an a uh y an indication that that I was interested in advance

dialogue type : s^ft
D :  and , in which case , I thank you .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cc.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  once I 'm given the data , I will provide w word - level transcripts with uh indication of speakers ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  and um

dialogue type : s^e
D :  I guess speaker change in any case ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  so speaker ID ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and words .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Well

dialogue type : s^na
D :  I 've transcribed a lot .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  But um e you know , the I mean , there are always ways of doing things more efficiently or more uh in a more technical technically sophisticated way ?

dialogue type : qy^j^rt
D :  Do you have to speak true English sentences when you do this ?

dialogue type : s^j:s
D :  " She can't speak ! "

dialogue type : s^j:s^ba
D :  " It 's terrible ! "

dialogue type : fg
D :  OK , So um

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
D :  " No one told me that . "

dialogue type : qh^j
D :  " This microphone , what 's this doing around my neck ? "

dialogue type : fg|s^rt^tc
D :  OK , so um typically , what I w you know I in uh i what I 've done before is I have a uh tape recorder , with a reverse button .

dialogue type : s
D :  And you just , you know , if it 's word level e you know , you do a e a r I just hit the r re the rewind button every couple of words

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and type what I know

dialogue type : s
D :  and then and then at the end do a breeze through to be sure that everything 's correct .

dialogue type : s
D :  However , they do have software these days which with a digitized uh record you can have control over replay through some sort of an interface .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um . I 've never used one of those .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  I know it would be an a wonderful idea .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's just I haven't transcribed in in awhile .

dialogue type : fg
D : 

dialogue type : fg|s^rt
D :  Foot pedals ? I 've used transcribing machines .

dialogue type : s^ba^rt
D :  That 's fine .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  um But I frankly didn't find it any more use to me than my hand - held taperecorder .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  However , if we have a transcribing machine I would accept it .

dialogue type : s
D :  The other thing is , you know , having getting hold of a transcriber .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think that CogSci has one .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  And I could probably borrow one .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  You have one yourself ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , I see !

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Oh , super !

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : %-
D :  I kn

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Oh , that 'd be super .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  This is great .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  This sounds wonderful .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
D :  Yeah , that 's true .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Now , we 're at a pilot phase right now ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  and what I was told is that beginning ,

dialogue type : s
D :  you know , that the the pilot data would be something like half hour of uh or f you know half hour to forty minutes of running text .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
D :  And so , for the pilot thing , you know , of course this would be useful .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I w I wou I 'm assu I 'm assuming that I would not be uh you know e eh uh transcribing all of it .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  No .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
D :  No , no .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yes .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Mm - hmm , yeah , OK , so now I 've I 've been involved with some of that . At at CogSci ,

dialogue type : h|s^e
D :  um So , Susan E Susan Ervin - Tripp , who you know um would typically , and I 've done this too , supervise undergrads to do this kind of thing

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
D :  if you give them a little bit of instruction and and make it interesting for them they can do it as a two ninety - eight or s

dialogue type : s^bsc
D :  or , not two ninety - eight , what is it , one whatever , undergraduate research credit .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
D : 

dialogue type : h|s^nd
D :  Well uh , you have to be sure you give them compensation for you know . of some of some sort .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  What I mean is it 's not necessarily monetary .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  But if they feel like they 're getting something out of it , sometimes you can do it that way .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  And otherwise , as part of a grant , you can you can do it .

dialogue type : s
D :  some sort of minimal wage .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  OK . Well , you also want to get quality .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I mean , someone 's going to have to pass through Either a higher level person will have to pass through , or you have to be sure you get good quality to begin with .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  But um , yeah , that 's quite you know we 've That 's been done .

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  I can ask Susan Ervin - Tripp what she would recommend on that .

dialogue type : s
D :  She 's really She 's done Of the people that I know , she 's the one who 's supervised the most of those things locally .

dialogue type : h|s^rt
D :  Uh uh Doctor Susan Ervin - Tripp .

dialogue type : s^e^rt
D :  faculty member in Psychology , recently retired ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
D :  and very well known in discourse analysis .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Oh , it 's very common .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  I think there 's always this question of the trade - off between uh paying more for the first pass , and then h and then editing less later .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  or paying less the first pass and editing more later .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
D :  Oh , But that 's a s

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yes .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Are you speaking about Mississippi State per se ?

dialogue type : qrr.%-
D :  or are y

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Actually , I wanted to mention There are two projects , which are international , huge projects focused on this kind of thing , actually .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  One of them 's MATE ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  one of them 's EAGLES .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  You know , I saw I know you know about the big book .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think you got it as a prize or something .

dialogue type : s
D :  Got a surprise .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  and MATE is a project which is being run out of Denmark

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
D :  and um they have a lot uh big uh , e

dialogue type : s
D :  you know , they 're trying to set up a a work bench or something or other .

dialogue type : s
D :  And they have a whole bunch of tools that are associated with them .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  So , I mean , there are things that in terms of like the time alignment issue

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , you guys are more expert on that , I mean , than I am ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I want to say that I know for a fact , I keep running across these ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and those would be my first two choices of looking at . EAGLES and MATE .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I have the documentation downstairs .

dialogue type : s
D :  I didn't think to bring it .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Oh , I have ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I wasn't interested in that particular issue .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , we 're talking now , once you have words you know , how do you time align it .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  and that 's .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  So , MATE and EAGLES are both within the so - called uh Language Engineering branch ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  and um so they 're intended for this kind of a comp compu s computer science application type of approach .

dialogue type : s
D :  These are not discourse types of tools .

dialogue type : fh|%-
D : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Can I be excused ,

dialogue type : s^cc^e^rt
D :  and I 'll go down and get my stuff ?

dialogue type : s^df.%-
D : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Are you serious ?

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : qy.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  And I go get my books and I 'll be right back .

dialogue type : s^t1
D :  I didn't think of bringing this .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Do I need this ?

dialogue type : s^rt^t1
D :  I need my keys .

dialogue type : fh
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^fe
D :  Oops !

dialogue type : s^r^t1
D :  I need my card key .

dialogue type : s^cc:s^fe
D :  I 'll try not to say , " So , Oh dear , Boy ! That 's itching there ! "

dialogue type : fh
D :  So ,

dialogue type : s^fe^t1
D :  Oops .

dialogue type : s^t1
D :  OK

dialogue type : s
D :  " Specification of uh Coding workbench " ,

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's one o thing ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  and then , back in here

dialogue type : s^t1
D :  " KCM file formats " ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  This is the

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Yeah , it is European .

dialogue type : s
D :  Both of these are Eur - European ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  but they have you know , American contributions , and stuff .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well i but you see they have a whole bunch of things .

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  and they rate things .

dialogue type : s
D :  I wasn't focused on that

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^co.%--
D :  Let me show y

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Have you seen this one , Dan ?

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  And I 'll try to get one for you , too .

dialogue type : s
D :  Oh , you 've got one .

dialogue type : qw
D :  What are you looking at here ?

dialogue type : s
D :  He 's got the Mark - up Framework .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Different coding schemes .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  What they 're doing is they 're comp comparing all these existing things that have been submitted

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  and And it includes , this one includes the TEI

dialogue type : fh
D :  and uh

dialogue type : s
D :  so it 's it 's um pretty broad - based .

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  That 's the Text Encoding Initiative .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's a way of marking mark - up .

dialogue type : s
D :  so , you know , but focus on tools to do this stuff

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  um , I do have a file also in addition to those things ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  but

dialogue type : s
D :  it 'll take me just a second here

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Well , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , that 's sort of my feeling about it ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  that you should be you should be able to translate between an XML and non - XML version

dialogue type : s
D :  cuz most at least , you know , with a focus on discourse , mostly .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
D :  Oh ! I wanted to

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  is um a query language for research in phonetics where he wants to build in ToBI tags

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  and so you can determine

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  um I wanted to mention this to you .

dialogue type : s
D :  I was going to come by and ask you about this .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Do you know about the Stuttgart um people ?

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  He says that uh in German " selbst " is used in two different ways

dialogue type : s:s
D :  so you have It either means uh " himself " or it means " even "

dialogue type : s
D :  and you can tell the difference in terms of uh intonation .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  So , they have the recordings such that they can locate things uh with by searching for part of speech and also intonational tags .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
D :  Anyway , that 's that .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  This is true .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
D :  This is true .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Which of course is another issue .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Exactly so .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  and then I have one more thing I need to find .

dialogue type : s^t1.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh . OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Well that 's what Morgan mentioned to me , too .

dialogue type : s^e
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  But you asked me about uh tools and things

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  and um There 's this one

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  um This is called " Transcriber " .

dialogue type : fh|s:s
D :  um " binary distribution for for uh Linux and Solaris and SGI and Windows " .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  " Transcriber is a tool for assisting creation of speech corpora . "

dialogue type : s^rt:s
D :  " It allows to manually segment , label and transcribe speech signals "

dialogue type : fh
D :  And ,

dialogue type : h|s
D :  uh , let 's see ,

dialogue type : qh
D :  where did I get this ?

dialogue type : s
D :  I got this from U Penn .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^am
D :  It is possible .

dialogue type : s^am
D :  It could be French .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I can't really tell .

dialogue type : s
D :  I 've never used any of them .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Here 's another thing I got .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
D :  Oh !

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Good idea .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Great idea .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Excellent idea .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  " Automatic annotation of prosody in Verbmobil . "

dialogue type : s
D :  This is the other think that um This is part of EAGLES ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  but um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but here again , it 's focusing on representation rather than the tools to do this .

dialogue type : qy
D :  Why do I feel like I 'm whispering ?

dialogue type : s^fe
D :  Oh !

dialogue type : s^ba^na
D :  I think that would be lovely .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Now , so , are we talking about the stage of uh simply the word stage ?

dialogue type : qrr
D :  or are you talking about tools that would allow the time alignment as well ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^fe
D :  Whoa !

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  you know , I roam around on on topics like this

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  And I think I got this off the U Penn

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and it does in fact cite a French site ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  so um they have some sort of an arrangement .

dialogue type : b
D :  Good .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I can't remember which aspect of U of U Penn I was following ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but It must have been the LDC .

dialogue type : s
D :  I I I bet you anything .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well there 's They have a special project , as I 'm remembering ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  and um , usually it doesn't deal with much that has to do with discourse ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but they uh they show up in resources .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  I like that very much ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I and I like the idea of also doing one that 's tied in with these larger corp corpus projects .

dialogue type : s
D :  So that , you know , the fact that , yeah , it 's U Penn and all that .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Oh , good idea .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's like the PDA thing .

dialogue type : s:qy
D :  So , like " did the French system use Tcl ? "

dialogue type : s^2
D :  if anyone wants to know .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yes !

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Yeah , there you go .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  Well , my my impression

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  you know , What would you need to indicate

dialogue type : s:qy
D :  and were there tools for that

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because um I suspect that would be uh pretty time intensive .

dialogue type : s
D :  I also wanted to say , in terms of like disc you know , if there are discussions about intonation contours I do have a certain amount of background in that

dialogue type : s
D :  and I really would be I 'd like to be involved in that .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bd
D :  Oh , not right now ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I mean in the future .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I I do I 'd like to I like that stuff .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
D :  So these are near near field ?

dialogue type : %--
D :  there

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  You know , if if we were to add in addition , and I 'm offering this , um to the word level , also the uh , so , stressed words , within utterances

dialogue type : s^cs^e
D :  I do think that that would help the information retrieval .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Oh , good point .

dialogue type : qy.%--
D : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  So , are are you familiar with this the MARS the MARSEC project ?

dialogue type : fh|s^cc
D :  Um , So , I 'll put this over here ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  cuz he seems to be the chairman .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
D :  Oh , he 's not ?

dialogue type : fg
D :  Well

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Well , he can y y

dialogue type : s^co
D :  discuss discuss among yourselves .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , this is a project that um has time - aligned spoken data

dialogue type : s
D :  which is um I see it as sort of in - between um these fields

dialogue type : s
D :  because a lot of the time when people do rich um intonational and and stress - oriented transcription they don't have the digital record at the same time

dialogue type : s
D :  and the don't have it time - aligned .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know how large this is , actually .

dialogue type : s.%--
