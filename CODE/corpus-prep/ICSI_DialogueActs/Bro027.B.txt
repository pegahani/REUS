dialogue type : z
B :  Test .

dialogue type : z
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : z
B :  Let 's see .

dialogue type : z
B :  Move it bit .

dialogue type : z
B :  Test ?

dialogue type : z
B :  Test ?

dialogue type : z
B :  OK ,

dialogue type : z
B :  I guess it 's alright .

dialogue type : fg
B :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  let 's see .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , Barry 's not here and Dave 's not here .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
B :  Um , I can say about just q just quickly to get through it , that Dave and I submitted this ASRU .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Yeah , it 's it 's interesting .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , basically we 're dealing with rever reverberation ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  and , um , when we deal with pure reverberation , the technique he 's using works really , really well .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , and when they had the reverberation here , uh , we 'll measure the signal - to - noise ratio

dialogue type : s
B :  and it 's , uh , about nine DB .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  And actually it brought up a question which may be relevant to the Aurora stuff too .

dialogue type : s
B :  Um , I know that when you figured out the filters that we 're using for the Mel scale , there was some experimentation that went on at at , uh at OGI .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but one of the differences that we found between the two systems that we were using , the the Aurora HTK system baseline system and the system that we were the the uh , other system we were using , the uh , the SRI system , was that the SRI system had maybe a , um , hundred hertz high - pass .

dialogue type : s
B :  And the , uh , Aurora HTK , it was like twenty .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^m
B :  Sixty - four ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Is that the ba band center ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  The edge is really , uh , sixty - four ?

dialogue type : s
B :  For some reason , uh , Dave thought it was twenty ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  but .

dialogue type : qw
B :  But do you know , for instance , h how far down it would be at twenty hertz ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  What the how much rejection would there be at twenty hertz , let 's say ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : qy
B :  any idea what the curve looks like ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  It 's actually set to zero ?

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  What kind of filter is that ?

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  Oh , so you , uh so you really set it to zero , the FFT ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that 's that 's a little different than Dave thought , I think .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But but ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  still , it 's possible that we 're getting in some more noise .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  So I wonder , is it @ @ Was there their experimentation with , uh , say , throwing away that filter or something ?

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right ,

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  but the question is , whether sixty - four hertz is is , uh , too , uh , low .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw^d
B :  On what test set ?

dialogue type : fg|s^nd
B :  Um , it was on the SpeechDat - Car .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  and on and on the , um , um , TI - digits also ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  That 'd be something to look at sometime

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because what , um , eh , he was looking at was performance in this room .

dialogue type : qy.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , you 'd think that 'd be more like SpeechDat - Car ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  I guess ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  in terms of the noise .

dialogue type : s
B :  The SpeechDat - Car is more , uh , sort of roughly stationary , a lot of it .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , maybe it 's not a big deal .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Anyway , that was just something we wondered about .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But , um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , certainly

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , the signal - to - noise ratio , you know , looks a fair amount better if you if you high - pass filter it from this room .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  but it 's still pretty noisy .

dialogue type : s
B :  Even even for a hundred hertz up , it 's it 's still fairly noisy .

dialogue type : s
B :  The signal - to - noise ratio is is is actually still pretty bad .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
B :  that 's on the far field .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Yeah , the near field 's pretty good .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , we got a a video projector in here ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
B :  and , uh which we keep on during every every session we record ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which , you know , I I w we were aware of

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but but we thought it wasn't a bad thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , that 's a nice noise source .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , and there 's also the , uh uh , air conditioning .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Which , uh , you know , is a pretty low frequency kind of thing .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So , those are those are major components , I think ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  uh , for the stationary kind of stuff .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but , um ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I guess , I maybe I said this last week too

dialogue type : s
B :  but it it it really became apparent to us that we need to to take account of noise .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so I think when when he gets done with his prelim study I think one of the next things we 'd want to do is to take this , uh uh , noise , uh , processing stuff and and , uh uh , synthesize some speech from it .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : h|s
B :  Um , I think in about , um , a little less than two weeks .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , it might even be sooner .

dialogue type : fh|qy^d^rt^t1
B :  Uh , let 's see , this is the sixteenth ,

dialogue type : qy^d^t1
B :  seventeenth ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^no.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  It might even be in a week .

dialogue type : s^r
B :  A week ,

dialogue type : s
B :  week and a half .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , the semester actually is starting up .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^df^na
B :  the semester 's late late August they start here .

dialogue type : s
B :  So they do it right at the beginning of the semester .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : %--
B :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s
B :  the overall results seemed to be first place in in in the case of either , um , artificial reverberation or a modest sized training set .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , either way , uh , i uh , it helped a lot .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I thought that One thing with the HTK is that is has the as we 're using the configuration we 're using is w s is being bound by the terms of Aurora ,

dialogue type : s
B :  we have all those parameters just set as they are .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  So even if we had a hundred times as much data , we wouldn't go out to , you know , ten or t or a hundred times as many Gaussians or anything .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  um , it 's kind of hard to take advantage of of of big chunks of data .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , whereas the other one does sort of expand as you have more training data .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  It does it automatically , actually .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And so ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  that one really benefited from the larger set .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  And it was also a diverse set with different noises and so forth .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh , so , um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So , if you have that that better recognizer that can that can build up more parameters , and if you , um , have the natural room , which in this case has a p a pretty bad signal - to - noise ratio , then in that case , um , the right thing to do is just do u use speaker adaptation . And and not bother with with this acoustic , uh , processing .

dialogue type : s
B :  But I think that that would not be true if we did some explicit noise - processing as well as , uh , the convolutional kind of things we were doing .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's sort of what we found .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Is there any word yet about the issues about , um , adjustments for different feature sets or anything ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it 's like that that could r turn out to be an important issue for us .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw^d
B :  For r w what test set ?

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
B :  But that has nothing to do with what we 're testing on , right ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^d
B :  So they 're set they 're setting it based on that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  So now , we may come back to the situation where we may be looking for a modification of the features to account for the fact that we can't modify these parameters .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But , um ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  but it 's still worth , I think , just since you know , just chatting with Joe about the issue .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , it 's not a secret .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I mean , we 're , you know , certainly willing to talk about it with everybody ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Uh @ @ you know , it 's a dialogue between two of you about what you know , what does he think about this and what what you know what could be done about it .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  you know .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  But , I mean , I think it all should come up eventually ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but if if if there is any , uh , uh , way to move in a way that would that would , you know , be more open to different kinds of features .

dialogue type : s
B :  But if if , uh if there isn't , and it 's just kind of shut down and and then also there 's probably not worthwhile bringing it into a larger forum where where political issues will come in .

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  Uh , this is slightly off topic

dialogue type : fh
B :  but , uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I noticed , just glancing at the , uh , Hopkins workshop , uh , web site that , uh , um one of the thing I don't know Well , we 'll see how much they accomplish , but one of the things that they were trying to do in the graphical models thing was to put together a a , uh , tool kit for doing , uh r um , arbitrary graphical models for , uh , speech recognition .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  So And Jeff , uh the two Jeffs were

dialogue type : h
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|qy
B :  Oh , uh , do you know Geoff Zweig ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , he he , uh he was here for a couple years

dialogue type : s
B :  and he , uh got his PHD .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  And he 's , uh , been at IBM for the last couple years .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , so he did he did his PHD on dynamic Bayes - nets ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  uh , for for speech recognition .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  He had some continuity built into the model ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  presumably to handle some , um , inertia in the in the production system ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  What was it using before ?

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  S so , I 'm I 'm sorry ,

dialogue type : qw^d^rt
B :  there 's there 's there 's how many how many inputs ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Twelve times nine inputs ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and a hundred , uh , hidden .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  Two outputs .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  So I guess about eleven thousand parameters ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which actually shouldn't be a problem , even in in small phones . Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , it 's a l it 's a lot better .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's great .

dialogue type : qw
B :  What 's the latency ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I I 'm confused .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  You started off with two - twenty and you ended up with one - seventy ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
B :  Two - seventy .

dialogue type : b
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's two - twenty .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  I the is this are these twenty - millisecond frames ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Is that why ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Is it after downsampling ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B : 

dialogue type : %
B :  a

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  One hundred milliseconds for smoothing .

dialogue type : fh

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  median .

dialogue type : s^t1
B : 

dialogue type : s^t1.%--
B :  forty p

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s^co
B :  Uh , p Wait a minute .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's forty forty for the for the cleaning of the speech ,

dialogue type : s
B :  forty for the I N ANN ,

dialogue type : s
B :  a hundred for the smoothing .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  Well , but at ten ,

dialogue type : s^m^na
B :  Twenty for delta .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Delta at input to net ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  ten milliseconds for LDA filter ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
B :  and t and ten another ten milliseconds you said for the frame ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  And then there 's delta besides that ?

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh|%--
B :  Well , I mean ,

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Wait a minute .

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^g^rt
B :  Some of this is , uh is , uh is in parallel , isn't it ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Oh , you have the LDA as part of the V D - uh , VAD ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qy^bh
B :  Oh , it does ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Ah .

dialogue type : s
B :  So in that case there isn't too much in parallel .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fg|qw^d
B :  Um , so the delta at the end is how much ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  Fifty .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
B :  So

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  uh then then it could go in parallel .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  And you ought to be able to shove tw , uh sh uh pull off twenty milliseconds from somewhere else to get it under two hundred ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  The hundred milla

dialogue type : s
B :  mill a hundred milliseconds for smoothing is sort of an arbitrary amount .

dialogue type : s
B :  It could be eighty

dialogue type : s.%
B : 

dialogue type : s^no
B :  Well , we don't know .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  They 're still arguing about it .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  I mean , if it 's two if if it 's , uh if it 's two - fifty , then we could keep the delta where it is if we shaved off twenty .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  If it 's two hundred , if we shaved off twenty , we could we could , uh , meet it by moving the delta back .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  Uh , we don't ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I mean , the main thing is that since that we got burned last time , and you know , by not worrying about it very much , we 're just staying conscious of it .

dialogue type : %--
B :  And so , th

dialogue type : s:s^co
B :  I mean , if if if a week before we have to be done someone says , " Well , you have to have fifty milliseconds less than you have now " , it would be pretty frantic around here .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  He added a bit on ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I guess , because before we were we were had were able to have the noise , uh , stuff , uh , and the LVA be in parallel .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  And now he 's he 's requiring it to be done first .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  let 's say ten milliseconds seconds for the LDA .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , ten .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then forty for the other .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so you could start pulling back ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  I mean , you have twenty for delta computation

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which y now you 're sort of doing twice ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  right ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  But yo w were you doing that before ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , what you have now is fort uh , forty for the the noise , twenty for the delta , and ten for the LDA .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's seventy milliseconds of stuff which was formerly in parallel ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So I think ,

dialogue type : s
B :  you know , that 's that 's the difference as far as the timing ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and you could experiment with cutting various pieces of these back a bit ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , we 're s we 're not we 're not in terrible shape .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's it 's not like it 's adding up to four hundred milliseconds or something .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , it 's I think it 's better than anything , uh , anybody got .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B :  Uh

dialogue type : s
B :  With the f with the neural net .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  And we still don't have the neural net in .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  You know .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  We 're we 're doing better .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , we 're getting better recognition .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , I 'm sure other people working on this are not sitting still either ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , the important thing is that we learn how to do this better ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and , you know .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
B :  So , our ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Yeah , you can see the kind of kind of numbers that we 're having , say , on SpeechDat - Car

dialogue type : s^ba^e
B :  which is a hard task ,

dialogue type : s
B :  cuz it 's really , um I think it 's just sort of sort of reasonable numbers , starting to be .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  I mean , it 's still terri

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^bk^r
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Probably half .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Good !

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  So you you were get

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Probably . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So fi si fifty - three is what you were getting with the old VAD .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  and sixty - two with the the , you know , quote , unquote , cheating VAD .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  And fifty - seven is what you got with the real VAD .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's great .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
B :  h he likes to use them both ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz then it has one part that 's discriminative ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  one part that 's not .

dialogue type : %
B :  y

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  You 're just using the full ninety features ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  Y you have ninety features ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And from the other side it 's forty - five .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's you have seventy - three features ,

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  and you 're just feeding them like that .

dialogue type : qy^d
B :  There isn't any KLT or anything ?

dialogue type : s^j
B :  It 's a multiple of seven .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Well , yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Suppose the information you added , well , was a really terrible feature and all it brought in was noise .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Or or suppose it wasn't completely terrible ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but it was completely equivalent to another one feature that you had ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  except it was noisier .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  In that case you wouldn't necessarily expect it to be better at all .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  On the highly mismatched condition .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , " highly mismatched condition " means that in fact your training is a bad estimate of your test .

dialogue type : s
B :  So having having , uh , a g a l a greater number of features , if they aren't maybe the right features that you use , certainly can e can easily , uh , make things worse .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I mean , you 're right .

dialogue type : s
B :  If you have if you have , uh , lots and lots of data , and you have and your your your training is representative of your test , then getting more sources of information should just help .

dialogue type : s
B :  But but it 's It doesn't necessarily work that way .

dialogue type : %--
B :  So I wonder ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : qw
B :  Well , what 's your what 's your thought about what to do next with it ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , we might uh , we might have to experiment with , uh better training sets .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Again .

dialogue type : %--
B :  But ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I The other thing is , I mean , before you found that was the best configuration , but you might have to retest those things now that we have different The rest of it is different ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : qw
B :  For instance , what 's the effect of just putting the neural net on without the o other other path ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , you know what the straight features do .

dialogue type : s
B :  That gives you this .

dialogue type : s
B :  You know what it does in combination .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
B :  But , yeah , that 's obviously another thing to try ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  since things are things are different .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  so all of these seventy - three features are going into , um , the , uh the HMM .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  And is are i i are are any deltas being computed of tha of them ?

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Are not .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Could .

dialogue type : %
B :  i

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  but the other thing I was thinking was ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , now I lost track of what I was thinking .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I know what I was gonna say .

dialogue type : s
B :  No relation .

dialogue type : s
B :  The issue was that , um , this is supposed to be a standard that 's then gonna be fed to somebody 's recognizer somewhere

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which might be , you know , it it might be a concern how many parameters are use u used and so forth .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And so ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  they felt they wanted to set a limit .

dialogue type : s
B :  So they chose sixty .

dialogue type : s
B :  Some people wanted to use hundreds of parameters

dialogue type : s
B :  and and that bothered some other people .

dialogue type : fh
B :  u And so

dialogue type : s
B :  they just chose that .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  I I I think it 's kind of r arbitrary too .

dialogue type : s
B :  But but that 's that 's kind of what was chosen .

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  I I remembered what I was going to say .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  What I was going to say is that , um , maybe maybe with the noise removal , uh , these things are now more correlated .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  So you have two sets of things that are kind of uncorrelated , uh , within themselves ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but they 're pretty correlated with one another .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  they 're being fed into these , uh , variants , only Gaussians and so forth ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and and , uh ,

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
B :  so maybe it would be a better idea now than it was before to , uh , have , uh , one KLT over everything ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  to de - correlate it .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Maybe .

dialogue type : fh
B :  You know .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  So we found this this , uh this Macrophone data , and so forth , that we were using for these other experiments , to be pretty good .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So that 's i after you explore these other alternatives , that might be another way to start looking , is is just improving the training set .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Of course , you do have the problem that , um , u i we are not able to increase the number of Gaussians , uh , or anything to , uh , uh , to match anything .

dialogue type : s
B :  So we 're only improving the training of our feature set ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but that 's still probably something .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  that 's the only place that we can train .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  We can't train the other stuff with anything other than the standard amount ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw
B :  How big is the net , by the way ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  And again , you did experiments back then where you made it bigger

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  and it and that was that was sort of the threshold point .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  Much less than that , it was worse ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  and

dialogue type : s
B :  much more than that , it wasn't much better .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  so Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  So the training the the neural net is being trained with noise compensated stuff .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Which makes sense ,

dialogue type : fh|s^bs
B :  but , uh , you 're saying Yeah , the noisier ones are still going to be , even after our noise compensation , are still gonna be pretty noisy .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right ,

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  but the SpeechDat - Car data that you 're seeing is also reduced in noise

dialogue type : s^e
B :  by the noise compensation .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah , I mean , it depends on whether you believe that the noise compensation is equally reducing the noise on the test set and the training set .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , you 're saying there 's a mismatch in noise that wasn't there before ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but if they were both the same before , then if they were both reduic reduced equally , then , there would not be a mismatch .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Heaven forbid , this noise compensation process may be imperfect ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so maybe it 's treating some things differently .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , the Macrophone data , um , I think , you know , it was recorded over many different telephones .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  so , there 's lots of different kinds of acoustic conditions .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  I mean , it 's not artificially added noise or anything .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  So it 's not the same .

dialogue type : s
B :  I don't think there 's anybody recording over a car from a car ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  but I think it 's it 's varied enough that if if doing this adjustments , uh , and playing around with it doesn't , uh , make it better , the most uh , it seems like the most obvious thing to do is to improve the training set .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  uh the condition It it gave us an enormous amount of improvement in what we were doing with Meeting Recorder digits ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  even though there , again , these m Macrophone digits were very , very different from , uh , what we were going on here .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I mean , we weren't talking over a telephone here .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  But it was just I think just having a a nice variation in acoustic conditions was just a good thing .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  Number of deletions .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Me either .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Did they increase the number of deletions even for the cases that got better ?

dialogue type : s^e.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's only the highly mismatched ?

dialogue type : s^co
B :  And it Remind me again ,

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qw
B :  Uh , sorry ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , maybe the noise subtraction is subtracting off speech .

dialogue type : %
B :  Wh

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , right .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Uh , that 's right , that 's right .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B :  But , yeah ,

dialogue type : s
B :  actually the TIMIT noises are sort of a range of noises

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
B :  and they 're not so much the stationary driving kind of noises , right ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  It 's it 's pretty different .

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
B :  Isn't it ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Actually , you maybe you remember this .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  When you in in the old experiments when you ran with the neural net only , and didn't have this side path , um , uh , with the the pure features as well , did it make things better to have the neural net ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Was it about the same ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh , w i

dialogue type : qw.%--
B :  Than ?

dialogue type : fg
B :  So ,

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  until you put the second path in with the pure features , the neural net wasn't helping at all .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Well , that 's interesting .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
B :  They were doing similar enough things .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Well , I still think it would be k sort of interesting to see what would happen if you just had the neural net without the side thing .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  And and the thing I I have in mind is , uh , maybe you 'll see that the results are not just a little bit worse .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Maybe that they 're a lot worse .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  You know ?

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  But if on the ha other hand , uh , it 's , say , somewhere in between what you 're seeing now and and and , uh , what you 'd have with just the pure features , then maybe there is some problem of a of a , uh , combination of these things , or correlation between them somehow .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  If it really is that the net is hurting you at the moment , then I think the issue is to focus on on , uh , improving the the net .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um .

dialogue type : qw.%--
B :  So what 's the overall effe

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , you haven't done all the experiments

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
B :  but you said it was i somewhat better , say , five percent better , for the first two conditions , and fifteen percent worse for the other one ?

dialogue type : s
B :  But it 's but of course that one 's weighted lower ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so I wonder what the net effect is .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  So the so the worst it could be , if the others were exactly the same , is four ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : fh.%
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , it should be pretty close to cancelled out .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  and it 's not like we really know ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  but the argument anyway is that , um , uh , we always have the prob

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , discriminative things are good .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  LDA , neural nets , they 're good .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Uh , they 're good because you you you learn to distinguish between these categories that you want to be good at distinguishing between .

dialogue type : s
B :  And PCA doesn't do that .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  It PAC - PCA low - order PCA throws away pieces that are uh , maybe not not gonna be helpful just because they 're small , basically .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  But , uh , the problem is , training sets aren't perfect and testing sets are different .

dialogue type : s
B :  So you f you you face the potential problem with discriminative stuff , be it LDA or neural nets , that you are training to discriminate between categories in one space

dialogue type : s
B :  but what you 're really gonna be g getting is is something else .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so , uh , Stephane 's idea was , uh , let 's feed , uh , both this discriminatively trained thing and something that 's not .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  So you have a good set of features that everybody 's worked really hard to make ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  and then , uh , you you discriminately train it ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but you also take the path that that doesn't have that ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  and putting those in together .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And that that seem

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's kind of like a combination of the uh , what , uh , Dan has been calling , you know , a feature uh , you know , a feature combination versus posterior combination or something .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's it 's , you know , you have the posterior combination

dialogue type : s
B :  but then you get the features from that and use them as a feature combination with these these other things .

dialogue type : s
B :  And that seemed , at least in the last one , as he was just saying , he he when he only did discriminative stuff , i it actually was was it didn't help at all in this particular case .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  There was enough of a difference , I guess , between the testing and training .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  The fact is some of the time , the discriminative stuff is gonna help you .

dialogue type : s
B :  And some of the time it 's going to hurt you ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B :  That i i

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I think that 's counter to that idea .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Now , again , it 's we 're just trying these different things .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  We don't really know what 's gonna work best .

dialogue type : s^df^na
B :  But if that 's the hypothesis , at least it would be counter to that hypothesis to do that .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and in principle you would think that the neural net would do better at the discriminant part than LDA .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Though , maybe not .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba^na
B :  Well , I think that 's a good idea .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Did did you do that

dialogue type : qrr.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  No , well , that 's a good idea .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : b.%
B :  i Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  Oh , no

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  it 's a g

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No , no ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but it might not not even be true .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  I mean , it 's it 's it 's it 's it 's a great idea .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , one of the things that always disturbed me , uh , in the the resurgence of neural nets that happened in the eighties was that , um , a lot of people Because neural nets were pretty easy to to use a lot of people were just using them for all sorts of things without , uh , looking at all into the linear , uh uh , versions of them .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And , uh , people were doing recurrent nets but not looking at IIR filters ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and You know , I mean , uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so I think , yeah , it 's definitely a good idea to try it .

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  Well , they 've been putting them in their systems off and on for ten years ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but but but , uh ,

dialogue type : s^2
B :  And now they all have that .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
B :  I I think part of why you were getting into the KLT Y you were describing to me at one point that you wanted to see if , uh , you know , getting good orthogonal features was and combining the the different temporal ranges was the key thing that was happening or whether it was this discriminant thing , right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I think you r

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , this is it doesn't have the LDA aspect

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
B :  but th as far as the orthogonalizing transformation , you were trying that at one point , right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I think you were .

dialogue type : s
B :  Does something .

dialogue type : s
B :  It doesn't work as well .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  i d I 'm sorry ,

dialogue type : qy
B :  does it still have the median filter stuff ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So it still has most of the delay ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B :  Well , w i

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , plus the delta ,

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  Now this this this , uh , " before and after clean " , it sounds like you think that 's a good feature .

dialogue type : s^bu^e|qy^d^g^rt
B :  That that , it you th think that the , uh the i it appears to be a good feature , right ?

dialogue type : qw^cs^rt
B :  What about using it in the neural net ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So if we if we can live with the latency or cut the latencies elsewhere , then then that would be a , uh , good thing .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt
B :  Um , anybody has anybody you guys or or Naren , uh , somebody , tried the , uh , um , second th second stream thing ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Well , what I think , you know , would be more what you 'd want to do is is is , uh , put it into another neural net .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  But ,

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  yeah , we 're we 're not quite there yet .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  So we have to figure out the neural nets , I guess .

dialogue type : qw^br^d^rt
B :  Wh - uh , the the VAD what ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  You could feed it into the neural net .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  The other thing you could do is just , um , p modify the , uh , output probabilities of the of the , uh , uh , um , neural net , tandem neural net , based on the fact that you have a silence probability .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  So you have an independent estimator of what the silence probability is ,

dialogue type : s^cs^df
B :  and you could multiply the two things , and renormalize .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , I mean , you 'd have to do the nonlinearity part and deal with that .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Uh , I mean , go backwards from what the nonlinearity would , you know would be .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : h|s^no
B :  Well , u Not sure .

dialogue type : fh
B :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s^co
B :  let 's put it this way .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , y you you have this complicated system with thousands and thousand parameters

dialogue type : s:s^co
B :  and you can tell it , uh , " Learn this thing . "

dialogue type : s:s^fe
B :  Or you can say , " It 's silence !

dialogue type : s:s^co^fe
B :  Go away ! "

dialogue type : fh
B :  I mean ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  I mean , i

dialogue type : qy.%--
B :  Doesn't ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I think I think the second one sounds a lot more direct .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : h
B :  Well , uh ,

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , y you 'd have to actually run it continuously ,

dialogue type : s.%
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  Well , no ,

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  you want to train on on the nonspeech also ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because that 's part of what you 're learning in it ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  to to to generate , that it 's it has to distinguish between .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Well , yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  But this other thing isn't perfect .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that you bring in some information from the net itself .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  i i It 's sort of bothersome that you 're getting more deletions .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Is too high .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Yeah , for instance .

dialogue type : fg
B :  But I bu

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Now the only problem is you don't want to ta I guess wait for the output of the VAD before you can put something into the other system ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz that 'll shoot up the latency a lot ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Am I missing something here ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that 's maybe a problem with what I was just saying .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , some of the things are , not in parallel ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but certainly , it would be in parallel with the with a tandem net .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  In time .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So maybe , if that doesn't work ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  But it would be interesting to see if that was the problem , anyway .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  And and and then I guess another alternative would be to take the feature that you 're feeding into the VAD , and feeding it into the other one as well .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  And then maybe it would just learn learn it better .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
B :  Yeah , that 's an interesting thing to try to see , if what 's going on is that in the highly mismatched condition , it 's , um , causing deletions by having this silence probability up up too high ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  at some point where the VAD is saying it 's actually speech .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Which is probably true .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Well , the V A

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  since the VAD is is is right a lot ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Anyway .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Might be .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Well , we just started working with it .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  But these are these are some good ideas I think .

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  Problem is , if you are going to run this on different m test sets , including large vocabulary ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^am

dialogue type : s^na
