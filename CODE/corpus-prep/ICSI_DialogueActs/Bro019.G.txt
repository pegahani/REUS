dialogue type : fg|s^rt
G :  Um , I have I have a question about the uh , parallelization ?

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  So , um , let 's say I have like , a thousand little little jobs to do ?

dialogue type : fh|qw
G :  Um , how do I do it with " run command " ?

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : qy^2^d
G :  A thousand times ?

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s
G :  too much file transfer and stuff .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^2
G :  Just do P - make .

dialogue type : %
G :  s

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
G :  You 're talking about your voicing ?

dialogue type : h|s^nd
G :  Um , nothing I wanna really talk about .

dialogue type : s^cs
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Sunil hasn't hasn't heard about uh , what I 've been doing .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  so ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  um , I told you I was I was I was getting prepared to take this qualifier exam .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  So basically that 's just , um , trying to propose um , uh , your next your your following years of of your PHD work ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  trying trying to find a project to to define and and to work on .

dialogue type : s
G :  So , I 've been , uh , looking into , um , doing something about r uh , speech recognition using acoustic events .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So ,

dialogue type : s
G :  um , the idea is you have all these these different events ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  for example voicing ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  nasality ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  R - coloring ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  you know burst

dialogue type : s^e
G :  or noise , uh , frication ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  that kinda stuff ,

dialogue type : s
G :  um , building robust um , primary detectors for these acoustic events ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and using the outputs of these robust detectors to do speech recognition .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  and , um , these these primary detectors , um , will be , uh , inspired by , you know , multi - band techniques , um , doing things , um , similar to Larry Saul 's work on , uh , graphical models to to detect these these , uh , acoustic events .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  And , um , so I I been I been thinking about that

dialogue type : s
G :  and some of the issues that I 've been running into are , um , exactly what what kind of acoustic events I need ,

dialogue type : s
G :  what um , what acoustic events will provide a a good enough coverage to in order to do the later recognition steps .

dialogue type : s
G :  And , also , um , once I decide a set of acoustic events , um , h how do I how do I get labels ?

dialogue type : s^e
G :  Training data for for these acoustic events .

dialogue type : s
G :  And , then later on down the line , I can start playing with the the models themselves ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  the the primary detectors .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  so ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  um , I kinda see like , after after building the primary detectors I see um , myself taking the outputs and feeding them in , sorta tandem style into into a um , Gaussian mixtures HMM back - end , um , and doing recognition .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  So , that 's that 's just generally what I 've been looking at .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  were were you gonna say something ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
G :  never mind .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um , yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  And so , this this past week um , I 've been uh , looking a little bit into uh , TRAPS um , and doing doing TRAPS on on these e events too ,

dialogue type : s
G :  just , um , seeing seeing if that 's possible .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Uh ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  and

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  um , other than that , uh , I was kicked out of I - house for living there for four years .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s^aap
G :  Uh , well , s s som something like that .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  In Albany ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  yeah .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
G :  And uh .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
G :  That 's it .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^r.%
G :  Thirty - first .

dialogue type : s^bk.%--
G :  Oh r

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  oh .

dialogue type : s^ar
G :  Oh no , no .

dialogue type : s^j^nd
G :  My my cardboard box is actually a nice spacious two bedroom apartment .

dialogue type : b
G :  yeah
