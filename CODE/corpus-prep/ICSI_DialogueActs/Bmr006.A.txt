dialogue type : fh|s
A :  And so , um , I wrote to Dan and he was very concerned that the SPINE stuff was moving to a non - backed - up disk .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  So , um , I realized that well , probably not all of that should be moved , just the CD - ROM type data , the the static data .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s
A :  before I actually deleted the old stuff , um , but I haven't heard back yet .

dialogue type : s
A :  I told him he could delete it if he wanted to , I haven't checked today to see if he 's deleted it or not .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then Carmen 's stuff , I realized that when I had copied all of her stuff to XA , I had copied stuff there that was dynamic data .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so , I had to redo that one and just copy over the static data .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so I need to get with her now and delete the old stuff off the disk .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then I lo haven't done any of the Aurora stuff .
