dialogue type : s^tc.%
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : fg|qy^t
B :  Um , do we wanna say something about the , an update of the , uh , transcript ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 'll it 'll be basically it 'll be a re - cap of a meeting that we had jointly this morning .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj.%--
B :  My feeling is that

dialogue type : s
B :  we discussed this right before coffee

dialogue type : sj^ba^na
B :  and I think it 's a it 's a fine idea partly because , um , it 's not un unrelated to their present skill set ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but it will add , for them , an extra dimension , it might be an interesting break for them .

dialogue type : s
B :  And also it is contributing to the , uh , c composition of the transcript

dialogue type : s
B :  cuz we can incorporate those numbers directly and it 'll be a more complete transcript .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  So I 'm I think it 's fine , that part .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ng
B :  And , that , you know , I 'm not , that that one I 'm not so sure if it 's into the

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because the , the time that they 'd be spending doing that they wouldn't be able to be putting more words on .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : sj
B :  It 's gonna be fun to see how we , compare at this .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Very exciting . s @ @ .

dialogue type : s
B :  s @ @ . It s strikes me that there are more each of them is more informative because it 's so , random ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and that people might articulate more ,

dialogue type : sj
B :  and you that might end up with more a closer correspondence .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  H That could could be an interesting design , too , cuz then you 'd have the com the comparison of the , uh , predictable speech versus the less predictable speech

dialogue type : s
B :  and maybe you 'd find that it worked in , in the , case of the pr of the , uh , non - predictable .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Well .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah , sure .

dialogue type : s^bk^r
B :  Sure .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : sj.%--
B :  It would seem to me that the points of articulation would be m more , g

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , I mean that 's I think about articulatory features , I think about , points of articulation , which means , uh , rather than vowels .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , is it , uh , bilabial or dental or is it , you know , palatal .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Which which are all like where where your tongue comes to rest .

dialogue type : s^bsc^m
B :  Place .

dialogue type : s^ft.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I really meant place .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  That 's Well , isn't that I thought that was , well but that wasn't that kinda the direction ?

dialogue type : sj.%--
B :  I thought

dialogue type : sj^cs
B :  W Well it seems like you could do both .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B :  I mean , I was thinking that it would be interesting , to do it with respect to , parts of Switchboard anyway , in terms of ,

dialogue type : fh|s^df
B :  uh partly to see , if you could , generate first guesses at what the articulatory feature would be , based on the phone representation at that lower level .

dialogue type : s
B :  It might be a time gain .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  But also in terms of comparability of , um ,

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  what you gain

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  And you get the relative gain up ahead .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  So in in our case you 'd think about us s starting with maybe the regular dictionary entry ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  and then ?

dialogue type : qrr
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk.%
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  And I 'm and these people might they they are , s most of them are trained with IPA .

dialogue type : s
B :  They 'd be able to do phonetic - level coding , or articulatory .

dialogue type : s^na^rt
B :  Well , you know , I mean they , they they 're interested in continuing working with us ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so I mean I , and this would be up their alley , so , we could when the when you d meet with , with John Ohala and find , you know what taxonomy you want to apply , then , they 'd be , good to train onto it .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  I think so , too .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Interesting idea .

dialogue type : s.x
B :  He 's got lip lipsmacks .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Wow .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Interesting .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B :  so , um ,

dialogue type : sj
B :  I think I might have done what you 're requesting , though I did it in the service of a different thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  I have thirty minutes that I 've more tightly transcribed with reference to individual channels .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
B :  No , actually it 's a different meeting .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  So , um , e so the , you know , we have the , th they transcribe as if it 's one channel with these with the slashes to separate the overlapping parts .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then we run it through then it then I 'm gonna edit it and I 'm gonna run it through channelize which takes it into Dave Gelbart 's form format .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then you have , all these things split across according to channel ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then that means that , if a person contributed more than once in a given , overlap during that time bend that that two parts of the utterance end up together , it 's the same channel ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then I took his tool , and last night for the first thirty minutes of one of these transcripts , I , tightened up the , um , boundaries on individual speakers ' channels ,

dialogue type : s
B :  cuz his his interface allows me to have total flexibility in the time tags across the channels .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And um , so .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Might not be what you need .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : qw.%-
B :  Uh , how how m much

dialogue type : s
B :  time so the meetings vary in length ,

dialogue type : qw
B :  what are we talking about in terms of the number of minutes you 'd like to have as your as your training set ?

dialogue type : qr^bu^d^rt.%--
B :  OK , now you 're saying different meetings because of different speakers or because of different audio quality or both or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  The pre presegment

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng|qy^cs^d^rt
B :  Well , no , if we were to start with this and then tweak it h manually , would that that would be OK ?

dialogue type : b.%
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qw^rt.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , we could easily , get a section , you know , like say a minute or so , from every meeting that we have so f from the newer ones that we 're working on , everyone that we have .

dialogue type : %--
B :  And then ,

dialogue type : s
B :  should provide this .

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  Somewhere not in the very beginning , five minutes , OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , then I wanted to ask you just for my inter information ,

dialogue type : qy.%--
B :  then , would you , be trai

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B :  cuz I don't quite unders

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  so , would you be training then , um , the segmenter so that , it could , on the basis of that , segment the rest of the meeting ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  So , if I give you like five minutes is the idea that this would then be applied to , uh , to , providing tighter time bands ?

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Wow , interesting .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Excellent .

dialogue type : s^bk^r
B :  Excellent , OK .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Wonderful .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : qr.%--
B :  Well oh wa in terms of the speakers or the conditions or the ?

dialogue type : h|s^aa^rt
B :  Um , we have different combinations of speakers .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  I mean , just from what I 've seen , uh , there are some where , um , you 're present or not present ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and , then then you have the difference between the networks group and this group

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep , we do .

dialogue type : h|s^ar
B :  Um , no .

dialogue type : s^bsc^rt.%--
B :  We could ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean you you recorded one last week or so .

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  I could get that new one in this week I get that new one in .

dialogue type : b
B :  Great .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  OK , so if I ,

dialogue type : s^t1.%--
B :  OK , included include ,

dialogue type : s
B :  OK , then , uh , if I were to include all together samples from twelve meetings that would only take an hour

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  and I could get the transcribers to do that

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , what I mean is , that would be an hour sampled , and then they 'd transcribe those that hour ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  That 's what I should do ?

dialogue type : s^bsc
B :  I don't mean transcribe

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean I mean adjust .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  So they get it into the multi - channel format and then adjust the timebands so it 's precise .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I did I did , um , uh , so , last night I did , uh ,

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  Oh gosh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  well , last night , I did about half an hour in , three hours , which is not , terrific ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but , um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , I can't calculate on my , on my feet .

dialogue type : h|s^ng
B :  Well , um they 're still working they still have enough to finish that I haven't assigned a new meeting ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  but the next , m m

dialogue type : s
B :  I was about to need to assign a new meeting

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and I was going to take it from one of the new ones ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and I could easily give them Jerry Feldman 's meeting ,

dialogue type : s
B :  no problem .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , that first set .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so I was in the process of like editing them but this is wonderful news .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  also we were thinking maybe applying that that to getting the ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Yeah , that 'll be , very useful to getting the overlaps to be more precise all the way through .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes , it does .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
B :  So , um , um , Liz , and and Don , and I met this morning , in the BARCO room , with the lecture hall ,

dialogue type : s^m
B :  and this afternoon ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it drifted into the afternoon , uh , concerning this issue of , um , the , well there 's basically the issue of the interplay between the transcript format and the processing that , they need to do for , the SRI recognizer .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And , um , well , so , I mentioned the process that I 'm going through with the data ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so , you know , I get the data back from the transcri Well , s uh , metaphorically , get the data back from the transcriber ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then I , check for simple things like spelling errors and things like that .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , um , I 'm going to be doing a more thorough editing , with respect to consistency of the conventions .

dialogue type : s
B :  But they 're they 're generally very good .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , then , I run it through , uh , the channelize program to get it into the multi - channel format , OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  And the , what we discussed this morning , I would summarize as saying that , um , these units that result , in a a particular channel and a particular timeband , at at that level , um , vary in length .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , um , their recognizer would prefer that the units not be overly long .

dialogue type : s
B :  But it 's really an empirical question , whether the units we get at this point through , just that process I described might be sufficient for them .

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  So , as a first pass through , a first chance without having to do a lot of hand - editing , what we 're gonna do , is , I 'll run it through channelize , give them those data after I 've done the editing process and be sure it 's clean .

dialogue type : s
B :  And I can do that , pretty quickly , with just , that minimal editing , without having to hand - break things .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then we 'll see if the units that we 're getting , uh , with the at that level , are sufficient .

dialogue type : s
B :  And maybe they don't need to be further broken down .

dialogue type : s
B :  And if they do need to be further broken down then maybe it just be piece - wise , maybe it won't be the whole thing .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  also we discussed some adaptational things ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  so it 's like ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  uh You know I hadn't , uh , incorporated , a convention explicitly to handle acronyms , for example ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  but if someone says , PZM it would be nice to have that be directly interpretable from , the transcript what they said ,

dialogue type : s^bsc
B :  or Pi - uh Tcl TCL I mean .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  It 's like

dialogue type : s
B :  y it 's and so , um , I 've I 've incorporated also convention , with that

dialogue type : s
B :  but that 's easy to handle at the post editing phase ,

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  and I 'll mention it to , transcribers for the next phase

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  but that 's OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then , a similar conv uh , convention for numbers .

dialogue type : s
B :  So if they say one - eighty - three versus one eight three .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , and also I 'll be , um , encoding , as I do my post - editing , the , things that are in curly brackets , which are clarificational material .

dialogue type : s
B :  And eh to incorporate , uh , keyword , at the beginning .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , it 's gonna be either a gloss or it 's gonna be a vocal sound like a , laugh or a cough , or , so forth .

dialogue type : s
B :  Or a non - vocal sound like a doors door - slam , and that can be easily done with a , you know , just a one little additional thing in the , in the general format .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I 've been I 've been adding that to the ones I 've been editing .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  And that doesn't the amount of editing that it would require is not very much either .

dialogue type : s
B :  I 'm just hoping that the units that are provided in that way , will be sufficient

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz I would save a lot of , uh , time , dividing things .

dialogue type : fg|%-
B :  Well n

dialogue type : s
B :  One question ,

dialogue type : qr
B :  e w would that be a single speaker or is that multiple speakers overlapping ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's very important .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
B :  In in doing the hand - marking ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  Yeah that 's what I was thinking , too .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Oh I wanted to ask one thing ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  the microphones the new microphones ,

dialogue type : qw.%-
B :  when do we get , uh ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
B :  Oh , exciting . K .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  K .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  You said it was used by aerobics instructors ?

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That says a lot .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .
