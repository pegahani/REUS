dialogue type : z
B :  OK Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%-
B :  OK so let 's uh

dialogue type : s^co^rt^t
B :  Let 's discuss agenda items .

dialogue type : qo^rt^t
B :  What did we have ?

dialogue type : s
B :  uh You you were announce some things

dialogue type : s^bk^rt^t
B :  OK , forms is one thing

dialogue type : s^j^rt^t
B :  uh , there 's status on on the uh transcription discussion which will take us about thirty seconds

dialogue type : s^rt^t
B :  uh and then uh Jose as usual uh , the one among us who 's actually doing a bunch of things on this

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  I was just glancing through it , so I think we have something to discuss about .

dialogue type : s^t
B :  um and um We just sent in that uh NSF pre - proposal

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  but I don't think there 's much to say about that except we 've sent it in and we 'll see what happens

dialogue type : h|qo^rt
B :  um Anybody ?

dialogue type : qo^rt
B :  Anything ?

dialogue type : qo
B :  Anything else going on ?

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt^tc
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|qo^cs^rt
B :  So Why don't we do it in that order ?

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Go ahead .

dialogue type : qw
B :  How fine a resolution do you need on that for this ?

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
B :  I mean maybe not so much .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  P prone .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No , no .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Less .

dialogue type : h|qy^rt.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bd^no
B :  I don't really know .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  I mean , were you thinking

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
B :  do you think that 's important ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : %-
B :  I

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^m^rt
B :  DTD ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : %-
B :  See

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  yeah

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : qr
B :  How about Yeah , how about Post - PHD researcher or something

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Um , this got very tricky in fact when we got involved with the Spanish program actually

dialogue type : s
B :  because uh , when we said , in our original forms , " post - doc " what we were used to , from the German program and from the US standard , when you say " post - doc " it meant somebody who had just gotten a PHD who was doing one year someplace .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  But when we did the Spanish call , many people said " oh I want to be uh have a post - doc slot " and they were twenty years out

dialogue type : s
B :  because they were " post " their " doc "

dialogue type : fh
B :  so

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : sj.%-
B :  Someone who 's just gotten their PHD uh , could be very very uh , strongly opinionated about something and somebody who 's been twenty years out could be shy , you know , s

dialogue type : qw
B :  What 's " Other " ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  so you want Professor to be in a separate category ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  So , I 'm te I 'm tending to push toward simpler

dialogue type : s^df
B :  even though I know that more detailed means more potential information for someone later who 's doing research in in this area

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Many of the meetings that we record uh , may be the kind where we just record somebody once

dialogue type : s^df
B :  even though we want to get a lot of data that has uh , many meetings with the same people .

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  And so the more forms we have and the more lines in the forms that 's th the more overhead for that one time thing makes it harder to do .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^aap
B :  Right . That 's what we 've done so far .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so I 'm saying I expect us to do both kinds .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
B :  So I 'm saying there are going to be What I imagine once we 've collected a lot of data , a chunk of it will be uh , the same people many times

dialogue type : s
B :  and another chunk of it will be people random meetings that we got with from different people

dialogue type : s
B :  and I think it 's use We 've talked about this before , it 's useful to have both kinds of data . I think .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Well , wait wait wait wait a minute ,

dialogue type : fh|s^bu
B :  um , It 's not illegal or anything

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ,

dialogue type : s^bu^e
B :  it 's not pushing on anything unethical or illegal , whatever , to ask for their age ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
B :  I suggest you ask for their age

dialogue type : s^co^e
B :  and if they say I don't want to give it say OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : s^cs^j:s
B :  O opt age is optional but those who don't give it will be given the uncomfortable microphones ?

dialogue type : s^j.%--
B :  The the mean of the estimates from the group will be used

dialogue type : s
B :  They might lie anyway .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean I mean the peop the people I 've known who 've lied about it I think would just lie about it .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^rt
B :  Hey , Jack Benny was thirty - nine for forty years .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  kinder and gentler .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't think it matters .

dialogue type : s^no^r
B :  I I don't think it matters .

dialogue type : s
B :  If it makes you more comfortable , put Optional

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I I I don't think it 's important but I also don't think it 's an important point the other way

dialogue type : s
B :  and I don't want to make you do it some different way than you want to do it .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : qw.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qw.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  was it Steve ?

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  Somebody was telling us about asking about uh ,

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh

dialogue type : qy.%-
B :  I I I 'm sorry , so you 're saying

dialogue type : s
B :  uh I I I just missed something , though .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Are you saying that you have both ?

dialogue type : qw^br.%--:qw.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^j
B :  Yeah , and Henry Higgins could say which block you were from .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : qo
B :  what about just doing the the sort of the Steve suggestion , uh , as as an add - on to it ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^cs:qw
B :  Rather than saying Region , just say " Where did you live between the ages of here and here ? "

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  And then they they could s

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
B :  Right yeah , they could say it different ways .

dialogue type : s^e.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu^nd
B :  Yeah but that but the good thing about it is it is it frees you from coming up with exactly what the right categories are .

dialogue type : h|qy^d^g^rt
B :  um , Right ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  But I think that if you 're going to have it be general uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|qh
B :  Yeah , and the question is how extensive this gets .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : qw.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  what was that what w how did you phrase it ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m.%--:qw.%--
B :  " What language was spok " ,

dialogue type : qo^rt^rt
B :  yeah , so it 's not where did you grow up , but what language was spoken in the home between the ages of , what would it be , five and twelve or something like that ?

dialogue type : s
B :  cuz he does make a good point about the region

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  For now ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  right

dialogue type : s
B :  so it 's I mean , again , we are hoping to expand this out ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  And somebody might .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  So internally , we have Texas and other .

dialogue type : b
B :  mm - hmm

dialogue type : fg|qy
B :  um so are you suggesting that you put something in about childhood in there .

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
B :  Well you could distinguish between pre - five and five t five to twelve ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So depending on what someone 's interest was in the formation of the phonetic kinds of categories or whether or whether you 're talking more about their linguistic speech patterns ,

dialogue type : s^f.%--
B :  you know uh

dialogue type : fh
B :  so

dialogue type : s
B :  But , again , it depends how fine we wanna get ,

dialogue type : s^cs:qw
B :  but we could say uh " where did you live before you were five ? " ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e:qw
B :  " where did you live after you were five ? " ,

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah

dialogue type : s^aa^m
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cs^tc
B :  Why don't we try it out . and see see what kind of responses we get from people .

dialogue type : s^tc.%-
B :  Anyway .

dialogue type : %-
B :  d I

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : h|%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^nd.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  oh No , no .

dialogue type : s
B :  I wasn't thinking political at all .

dialogue type : s
B :  I was just saying , looking at applications of people over the years for post - docs here .

dialogue type : s
B :  They 're r generally not very good at assessing their own abilities .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^am
B :  That could be .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  That could be .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Good ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Bad .

dialogue type : qw^cs:qw
B :  How b How About " How long have you been uh in in an English speaking country ? "

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
B :  Really ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  We done ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Oh , there 's another form .

dialogue type : s^ar|qw
B :  No , you got what 's the other form ?

dialogue type : qw^br
B :  In case people what ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  Well the other thing is that potentially if this is done over a period of time , someone 's email could change .

dialogue type : s^aa|sj^ba
B :  Oh yeah , that 's bad .

dialogue type : s^ft^t3.%
B :  Thanks

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^ft
B :  Then , you don't hafta ask the age .

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
B :  Social social security number .

dialogue type : s
B :  I Maybe I was missing something maybe ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  but I mean this is something one would try to infer ,

dialogue type : qw.%--
B :  but how do how would you How would you freeze that information about what , uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , we already have these things about someone 's a professor and someone 's a student , or something ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qr.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qw.%-
B :  What what what uh ,

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu.%-
B :  Oh , so you 're just putting preexisting relationships that are

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah , I m

dialogue type : s^bk|s^nd.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  So , I mean , for today , for instance ,

dialogue type : s
B :  this is the second meeting recorded today .

dialogue type : s
B :  The first meeting was a was a front - end meeting ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and in that one , the basic form of that was uh , I was the leader ,

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  and I was saying uh , " what are the results you 've gotten in the last week ? "

dialogue type : s
B :  And they were and uh one person was sort of taking the lead , in describing what the results were ,

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  and then uh , Chuck was taking the role of saying , " well , what did you mean by that ? " ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so he was sort of like the out s semi - outsider , asking curiosity questions .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then it would come back to me with saying " well , you know , you showed me that but you know , I think you should do this in the future , "

dialogue type : s
B :  so it was very much sort of " Leader " and and and and " Led " sort of relationship .

dialogue type : s
B :  And um the guy I was primarily doing this with uh is is a visiting researcher , uh , in this l meeting , uh , you are my graduate student ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but uh it 's not taking that kind of role at all ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  You 're you 're you 're actually leading the meeting for the most part , most of this meeting ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa^rt|s^bd
B :  Yeah , well , whatever .

dialogue type : fh|s^no
B :  So Uh Yeah , so I I don't know ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa|sj^df.%-
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  It 's sort of a research question , you you 're analyzing the meeting and you 're deciding , " ah , there 's this kind of structure to it . "

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it sounds like having the facility is great ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then over a period of time as the research happens on this we might develop some of these categories that would be generally useful

dialogue type : s
B :  and it it sounds like a good thing to do .

dialogue type : s
B :  Almost all of the meetings that we have are recorded with roughly this group

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  uh and uh you know and a fair minority with the group that we have in the morning ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so this is not a lot of people .

dialogue type : sj^cs.%-
B :  We could easily There 's just a couple other meetings that

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df
B :  OK , so we 're running kind of late ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  so we 'll probably wanna zip through some other things , maybe do some more time on on Jose 's stuff later ,

dialogue type : s^t
B :  um uh Status of Transcription ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  Uh , I guess , you know , we we recently woke up um our friends

dialogue type : fh
B :  and uh

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  so I I guess you 've sent off this the uh CD - ROMs

dialogue type : qy^d.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qr.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  McCoond

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Great , OK .

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  Well , that was that one .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  um , and I think we should just sort of look at this thing from you , off - line Jose

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz it 's getting kind of late

dialogue type : s
B :  but I mean I think the bottom line just glancing through it is that there 's there 's a lot of overlap , in just energy related things

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and so you need something else .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^rt.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  The residual error ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
B :  OK , so this is post bug fix .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Good , OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  So um so I had two thought just glancing through this .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , one is one is that um that uh we might wanna talk about normalization .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , I don't know what normalizations you use .

dialogue type : s
B :  Sometimes things have more overlap before you 've done some kind of normalization

dialogue type : s
B :  and we might think about what different kinds of normalizations are possible .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , residual LPC energy and just plain energy are very closely related , even though they 're different

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
B :  and um so um you really may need to go to something that looks at i in some sense harmonicity , or um um relationship to or fit fit to pitch tracks on uh on either side of of it , for instance ?

dialogue type : s^e.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qy^br^rt
B :  Excuse me ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I if you have two if you have two if you have uh two people speaking uh and there 's an overlap , then I mean the first thing is that there should be a mixture of harmonics uh during overlapped voice sections anyway .

dialogue type : s
B :  And um the any a measure that you have of how much of the energy is due to your best guess at a particular harmonic sequence , it 's also going to be a smaller fraction .

dialogue type : s
B :  This is , you know , related to the harmonicity sort of thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then the other thing I 'm saying is that if you look at the temporal evolution of the pitch there should be something like a discontinuity there .

dialogue type : s
B :  Now , there 's other places where you 'll have discontinuities in pitch and speech ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but but maybe it 'll have something to have a different character .

dialogue type : s^df^rt
B :  But it seems like energy energy tells you something ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but uh if unless this is a normalization problem , it looks from your results like there 's so much overlap that certainly you need something that isn't energy - like , in addition to it , at least .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy
B :  OK , so the question is is would some kind of normalization help .

dialogue type : s
B :  You know , uh , i i it could be that if you normalized uh by the overall um energy uh for uh you know some some longer period of time or something , uh that that there would be more of a distinction .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  uh , I I don't know .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Which is the intuition ,

dialogue type : s
B :  un unfortunately there 's a standard deviation of like ten ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
B :  so For each one ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  even if you make a mistake occasionally , that that i is roughly i is there some corresponding to that speaker , so that if you , if if uh if you

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because that that 's gonna spread out these distributions really a lot , to not do any kind of normalization ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and so that that could mask the effect somewhat .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  I have another another thought .

dialogue type : s
B :  Um , this is this is frame energy ,

dialogue type : s
B :  of course frame frames have a lot of variance to them

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because different sounds are different loudnesses .

dialogue type : qr^cs
B :  So I mean , what if you took uh one second chunks or something like that .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Or or maybe not even a second ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  maybe a quarter of a second or something ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Something ,

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B :  So so I mean , so you know two hundred , three hundred four hundred mill

dialogue type : s
B :  some longer chunk of time ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and then you looked at the amount of energy in that .

dialogue type : qr
B :  and how does that vary over these different cases .

dialogue type : s^aa^m
B :  or voiced regions .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , I mean , you could do a you could first determine that something was voiced or not .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , I mean the overlaps are typically more than just a tiny little bit of time

dialogue type : s
B :  and so uh there could be voiced and non - voiced pieces during the overlap .

dialogue type : s^no^rt
B :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  because it 's it 's this this has to do with these questions of harmonicity , and so forth ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
B :  Right , so you could do something like , uh

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Sure .

dialogue type : s
B :  But I think what will be easy for him to do would be to do this thing of looking over a large enough region of time .

dialogue type : s
B :  Cuz if you look over a large enough region of time , most of the time you 'll have some voiced a fair amount of voiced uh energy in it .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qy^bh
B :  Is it ?

dialogue type : qw^rt.%-
B :  What ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Are you using a pitch detector in this yet , in your experiments ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Do you have a pitch detector that you 're using ?

dialogue type : qy^r^rt
B :  Do you do you have a a pitch detector that you are using in these experiments ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Does does it have a voiced , unvoiced uh detector in it ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  It doesn't .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  it just finds the pi it just finds the pitch even when it 's unvoiced ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  I mean , it must have some It has to tell you something ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah . So ordinarily in these things , it does tell you that it 's it 's voiced with a pitch of such - and - such .

dialogue type : s
B :  And it will i i it will say something like zero

dialogue type : s
B :  or you know it 'll have something that it says when it 's when it can't find a good good uh uh period ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's looking for some periodic behavior ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and if it can't find a period it tells you for for most things like that .

dialogue type : s
B :  So I mean , this is , getting back to what Liz was suggesting

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  which I think actually is good , the more I think of it ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  that that um for normalization you could do something like take voiced sections and normalize to equalize the energy in that .

dialogue type : s
B :  I 'm just still going back to normalization , that even though it 's roughly normalized , uh , for overall gain , I think it it 's it it may not be normalized enough .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , for both ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s
B :  OK , so so I think I mean , @ @ this is something to to experimentally determine ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  but I mean , if um u

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  You have training data that you 're trying to find a threshold ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B :  and so um um if you take um all the things all the uh speak things marked " SPK " , and uh look for the voiced uh energy in them ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and uh

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  well , just in in each case , take a take a take a frame ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B :  take the

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh uh

dialogue type : s^cs
B : 

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Just separate out from the from the normal things ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  separate out voiced .

dialogue type : s^f
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Then you 're gonna end up with uh a a uh a mean uh standard devia deviation , and so forth .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
B :  And then do your normalization based on that .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And once you do that just for voiced ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um um

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
B :  w

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  You could do that ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  But but I I think that this is a good first thing , to just sort of see .

dialogue type : s
B :  And and what this says is that th that without any special normalization at least , this is there 's a lot of overlap here .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And so I mean coming back to Jose 's question ,

dialogue type : qr.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qw
B :  What do you look at in order to normalize ?

dialogue type : qr
B :  I mean , dur you you get some data in , you don't know which it is , how do you how do you W w what period of time do you look over to normalize it by ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And and uh , that 's that 's something to think about and experiment with .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Right , so that 's what we were talking about before with harmo with harmonicity measure .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah . So .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|%-
B :  Uh , well .

dialogue type : s^ba^tc
B :  Good .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
B :  I I wanna think about it

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and you should think about it .

dialogue type : s
B :  I I I didn't want to just pop out an answer

dialogue type : s
B :  because I realized I I hadn't thought about it enough .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I 'm not sure .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , what he 's saying is that the typecasting could be the issue , for F - seek .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah , cuz I think in I mean , in general F - seek works ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  so it 's

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah , Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Anyway ,

dialogue type : s^t^tc
B :  Anyway , we 're we 're missing snacks here ,

dialogue type : s^co
B :  so uh let 's let 's let 's let 's do our let 's do our digits

dialogue type : fh
B :  and and uh

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .
