F :  Ri

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  we 're interested in , um , methods for far mike speech recognition ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  um , mainly , uh , methods that deal with the reverberation in the far mike signal .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  one approach would be , um , say MSG and PLP , like was used in Aurora one

dialogue type : s
F :  and , um , there are other approaches which actually attempt to remove the reverberation , instead of being robust to it like MSG .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so we 're interested in , um , comparing the performance of um , a robust approach like MSG with these , um , speech enhancement or de - reverber de - reverberation approaches .

dialogue type : s
F :  And , um , it looks like we 're gonna use the Meeting Recorder digits data for that .

dialogue type : %
F :  o

F :  o

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  well , um ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  there was something that was done by , um , a guy named Carlos , I forget his last name , who worked with Hynek , who , um ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Who , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  um , it was like RASTA in the sense that of it was , um , de - convolution by filtering

dialogue type : s
F :  um , except he used a longer time window ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  like a second maybe .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  And the reason for that is RASTA 's time window is too short to , um include the whole , um , reverberation

dialogue type : s^no
F :  um , I don't know what you call it

dialogue type : s
F :  the reverberation response .

dialogue type : s
F :  I if you see wh if you see what I mean .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  The reverberation filter from my mouth to that mike is like it 's t got it 's too long in the in the time domain for the um for the RASTA filtering to take care of it .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  then there are a couple of other speech enhancement approaches which haven't been tried for speech recognition yet

dialogue type : s
F :  but have just been tried for enhancement ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which , um , have the assumption that um , you can do LPC um analysis of th of the signal you get at the far microphone

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and the , um , all pole filter that you get out of that should be good .

dialogue type : s^e^rt
F :  It 's just the , um , excitation signal that is going to be distorted by the reverberation

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  and so you can try and reconstruct a better excitation signal

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  and , um , feed that through the i um , all pole filter and get enhanced speech with reverberation reduced .
