dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt
B :  Oh , could you close the door , maybe ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  I guess the only other thing , uh , for which I

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um .

dialogue type : fh|s^t
B :  OK , so there 's digits , alignments ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and , um ,

dialogue type : s^t
B :  I guess the other thing , which I came unprepared for , uh , is , uh , to dis s s see if there 's anything anybody wants to discuss about the Saturday meeting .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  Any I mean , maybe not .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  With with whatever it was , a month and a half or something ahead of time , the only time we could find in common roughly in common , was on a Saturday .

dialogue type : b
B :  Ugh .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , h I mean , he probably has to go do something .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  R r right .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So we have to equip him with a with a with a head - mounted , uh , cell phone

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Well , it 's Yeah , sort of the bre the breath noises and the mouth clicks and so forth like that , the lapel 's gonna be better on .

dialogue type : s
B :  The lapel is typically worse on the on clothes rustling ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  but if no one 's rustling their clothes ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Right . So in the digits , in most most cases , there weren't other people talking .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^nd|s^ar
B :  There typically don't , no .

dialogue type : s
B :  They 're they 're intended to be omni - directional .

dialogue type : s
B :  And th it 's and because you don't know how people are gonna put them on , you know .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Um . Yeah , we actually talked about this in the , uh , front - end meeting this morning , too .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Much the same thing ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  uh , I mean , there the point of interest to the group was primarily that , um , the , uh the system that we had that was based on H T K , that 's used by , you know , all the participants in Aurora , was so much worse than the than the S R

dialogue type : s
B :  And the interesting thing is that even though , yes , it 's a digits task and that 's a relatively small number of words and there 's a bunch of digits that you train on , it 's just not as good as having a a l very large amount of data and training up a a a nice good big HMM .

dialogue type : s
B :  Um , also you had the adaptation in the SRI system , which we didn't have in this .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um . So . Um .

dialogue type : s
B :  I s I think Stephane , uh , had seen them .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Hav - Have you ever t Have you ever tried this exact same recognizer out on the actual TI - digits test set ?

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  It might be interesting to do that .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B :  Cuz my my cuz my sense ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs^ng
B :  Yeah , bu although I 'd be I think it 'd be interesting to just take this exact actual system

dialogue type : s^df
B :  so that these numbers were comparable

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  and try it out on TI - digits .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I mean , cuz we were getting sub one percent numbers on TI - digits also with the tandem thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , one so there were a number of things we noted from this .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  this , you know , very limited training HTK system .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , but the other is that , um , the digits recorded here in this room with these close mikes , i uh , are actually a lot harder than the studio - recording TI - digits .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think , you know , one reason for that , uh , might be that there 's still even though it 's close - talking , there still is some noise and some room acoustics .

dialogue type : s
B :  And another might be that , uh , I 'd I would presume that in the studio , uh , uh , situation recording read speech that if somebody

dialogue type : s
B :  did something a little funny or n pronounced something a little funny or made a little that they didn't include it ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  they made them do it again .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
B :  It 's wide - band , yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's in in fact , we looked it up

dialogue type : s
B :  and it was actually twenty kilohertz sampling .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B :  See w

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Well , the other thing would be to do it without the adaptation and compare to these numbers without the adaptation .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah . Most of TI - digits is connected digits , I think .

dialogue type : s
B :  The I mean , we had a Bellcore corpus that we were using .

dialogue type : s
B :  It was that 's that was isolated digits .

dialogue type : fh.%
B :  Um .

dialogue type : fg|s^ng
B :  Yeah . But the thing is , uh I mean , w when you it depends whether you 're ju were just using this as a a starter task for you know , to get things going for conversational or if we 're really interested i in connected digits .

dialogue type : s
B :  And I I think the answer is both .

dialogue type : s
B :  And for for connected digits over the telephone you don't actually want to put a whole lot of effort into adaptation

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because somebody gets on the phone and says a number

dialogue type : s^df^e
B :  and then you just want it .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah . So that 'd be anoth another interesting data point .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s^t.%-
B :  Yeah . At any rate , I don't know if w

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
B :  Too many adju too many adjustments . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt^t^tc
B :  Anyway , what I was saying is that I I think I probably wouldn't want to see that as sort of like the norm , that we compared all things to .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  To , uh , the to have have all this ad all this , uh , adaptation .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s
B :  The other thing that that , uh of course , what Barry was looking at was was just that ,

dialogue type : s
B :  the near versus far .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , yeah , the adaptation would get th some of that .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , I think even even if there was , uh , only a factor of two or something , like I was saying in the email , I think that 's that 's a big factor .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B :  N

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  It 's great .

dialogue type : qw^t^tc
B :  So , where were we ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , adaptation , non - adaptation ,

dialogue type : s
B :  um , factor of two ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Oh , yeah . I know what I was go w

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , no , no .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's tha that that we were saying , you know , well is how much worse is far than near , you know .

dialogue type : s
B :  And I mean it depends on which one you 're looking at ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  but for the everybody , it 's little under a factor or two .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah . I I know what I was thinking was that maybe , uh , i i we could actually t t try at least looking at , uh , some of the the large vocabulary speech from a far microphone ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  at least from the good one .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , before I thought we 'd get , you know , a hundred and fifty percent error or something ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  Right . I understand .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah , sure .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Get all these insertions .

dialogue type : s^cs^df.%-
B :  But I 'm saying if you do the same kind of limited thing as people have done in Switchboard evaluations or as a

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  Yeah . The same sort of numbers that we got those graphs from .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
B :  Yeah , do it with one of on

dialogue type : qw
B :  But but but how did we get the how did we determine the links , uh , that we 're testing on in the stuff we reported ?

dialogue type : %-
B :  And tha

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  And that 's what we were getting those numbers from .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Well , we could start with the good ones .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  But anyway so I think that we should try it once with the same conditions that were used to create those ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  and in those same segments just use one of the P Z

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And then , you know , I mean , the thing is if we were getting , uh what , thirty - five , forty percent , something like that on on that particular set ,

dialogue type : qh
B :  uh , does it go to seventy or eighty ?

dialogue type : qh
B :  Or , does it use up so much memory we can't decode it ?

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  This is kind of central .

dialogue type : s
B :  You know , it 's so i but I would I 'd pick that one .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 'll be less good for some people than for other ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  but I I 'd like to see it on the same exact same data set that that we did the other thing on .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^na
B :  That 's probably one of the reasons .

dialogue type : s^df^ng
B :  But the other is , it 's very , uh I mean , even though there 's I 'm sure the f f the the SRI , uh , front - end has some kind of pre - emphasis , it 's it 's , uh still , th it 's picking up lots of low - frequency energy .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , even discriminating against it , I 'm sure some of it 's getting through .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  But , yeah , you 're right .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Prob - a part of it is just the distance .

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  Well , they 're bad .

dialogue type : s^df^ng
B :  But , I mean , if you listen to it , it sounds OK . You know ?

dialogue type : b.%
B :  u Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , they 're twenty - five cents or so .

dialogue type : b.x
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , I mean , the thing is people use those little mikes for everything

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because they 're really not bad .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  I mean , if you 're not doing something ridiculous like feeding it to a speech recognizer , they they they you know , you can hear the sou hear the sounds just fine .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  They I mean , i it 's more or less the same principles as these other mikes are built under ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it 's just that there 's less quality control .

dialogue type : s
B :  They just , you know , churn them out and don't check them .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um . So .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  So that was Yeah . So that was i interesting result .

dialogue type : s
B :  So like I said , the front - end guys are very much interested in in this is as as well

dialogue type : %-
B :  and

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Well , I think what we wanna do is we want to eh ,

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  we want to have the ability to feed it different features .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then , um , from the point of view of the front - end research , it would be s uh , substituting for HTK .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think that 's the key thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then if we can feed it different features , then we can try all the different things that we 're trying there .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then , um , uh , also Dave is is thinking about using the data in different ways , uh , to um , uh , explicitly work on reverberation

dialogue type : s^e
B :  starting with some techniques that some other people have found somewhat useful , and Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
B :  H h

dialogue type : s
B :  He 's he 's sort of back ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but he drove for fourteen hours an and wasn't gonna make it in today .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|%-
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Cool .

dialogue type : fg|qo^d^e
B :  OK . So the s the the next thing we had on the agenda was something about alignments ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw
B :  G given I I mean , I wa I wa I was gonna ask you anyway , uh , how you assessed that things were better .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  So so if we e e even just had a a It sounds like w we we almost do .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  Uh , if we We have two .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Just ha uh , trying out the alignment procedure that you have on that

dialogue type : s
B :  you could actually get something , um uh , uh , get an objective measure .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
B :  H

dialogue type : s:s
B :  I tell you , I say I say " uh - huh " a lot ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  while people are talking to each other .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^df
B :  Yeah . I mean , y y you folks have probably already told me ,

dialogue type : qy
B :  but were were you intending to do a Eurospeech submission ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B :  or ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  Do as I say ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  don't do as I do .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah . I know that th the Telecom people use use " spurt " for that .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
B :  And that 's I mean , I I was using that for a while when I was doing the rate of speech stuff ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--:s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  and an because cuz it 's another question about how many pauses they put in between them .

dialogue type : qo
B :  But how fast do they do the words within the spurt ?

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Here .

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
B :  Just very locally , yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba.%-
B :  Yeah . That 's the good thing about these pape

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  No , it 's that 's the good thing about these pape paper deadlines and , uh , you know , class projects , and and things like that ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B :  because you you really get g

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Oh , now it 's out in the public ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  this this this secret information .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Th - that 's that 's true .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  That 's true .

dialogue type : s
B :  By th by the way , this is totally unfair , you may you may feel ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but the the , uh the morning meeting folks actually have an an extra month or so .

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's a special Aurora session

dialogue type : s
B :  and the Aurora pe people involved in Aurora have till Ma - uh , early May or something to turn in their paper .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  I if it w

B : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  No , it wouldn't work .

dialogue type : s^m^na.%--

dialogue type : %-
B :  It

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  This is not the Aurora task .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Maybe .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I think it 's a littl little far - fetched .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Nah , I mean , the thing is Aurora 's pretty closed community .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , you know , the people who were involved in the the only people who are allowed to test on that are people who who made it above a certain threshold in the first round ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh w in ninety - nine

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bu^d^j^rt
B :  Oh , you don't like HTK ?

dialogue type : s
B :  No . I mean , this it it 's the HTK that is trained on a very limited amount of data .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  Oh , yeah . I I really think that that 's true .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  And they i i

dialogue type : %-
B :  i

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B :  Well , u i

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , for the evaluations , yes , we 'll run a version that hasn't been touched .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , uh , one of the reasons I have him messing around with that , because I think it 's sort of an open question that we don't know the answer to .

dialogue type : s
B :  People always say very glibly that i if you s show improvement on a bad system , that doesn't mean anything ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz it may not be show uh , because , you know , it doesn't tell you anything about the good system .

dialogue type : s
B :  And I I 've always sort of felt that that depends .

dialogue type : s
B :  You know , that if some peopl If you 're actually are getting at something that has some conceptual substance to it , it will port .

dialogue type : s
B :  And in fact , most methods that people now use were originally tried with something that was not their absolute best system at some level .

dialogue type : s
B :  But of course , sometimes it doesn't , uh , port .

dialogue type : s
B :  So I think that 's that 's an interesting question .

dialogue type : qo.%-
B :  If we 're getting three percent error on , uh , u uh , English , uh , nati native speakers , um , using the Aurora system , and we do some improvements and bring it from three to two , do those same improvements bring , uh , th you know , the SRI system from one point three to you know , to point eight ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Well .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  You know , so that 's that 's something we can test .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Anyway .

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  I think we 've we 've covered that one up extremely well .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  So tha so we 'll you know , maybe you guys 'll have have one .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , you you and , uh and Dan have have a paper that that 's going in .

dialogue type : s
B :  You know , that 's that 's pretty solid , on the segmentation stuff .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  And the Aurora folks here will will definitely get something in on Aurora ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .
