dialogue type : z
A :  We 're we 're live by the way , so we 've got a good intro here

dialogue type : z
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : z
A :  We can edit that out if you want .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  So . This time the form discussion should be very short ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Good point .

dialogue type : s^t3
A :  Hi Jane !

dialogue type : s
A :  We just started .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Could you take that mike there ?

dialogue type : s^ft
A :  Thanks .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
A :  No , I just took over the entire s uh entire channel

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um sampled ten minutes randomly .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah , this was quite quick and dirty , and it was just for listening .

dialogue type : sj^df
A :  And for listening it seems to work really well .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  But , it 's not Not a good measure .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yes , absolutely .

dialogue type : s
A :  Except that it 's hard to judge this because the they 're not normalized .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  It 's just number of frames .

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  But yeah , even so .

dialogue type : sj^ba^t1
A :  Interesting

dialogue type : s
A :  And I was just going to say that that right now we 're just exploring .

dialogue type : s
A :  What you would imagine eventually , is that you 'll feed all of these features into some discriminative system .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so even if if one of the features does a good job at one type of overlap , another feature might do a good job at another type of overlap .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  No prayer .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  That was a great overlap by the way .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , but But I think that 's what I was saying about different types of overlap .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : qy
A :  Mind if I turned that light off ?

dialogue type : s^df
A :  The flickering is annoying me .

dialogue type : %-
A :  Tone

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
A :  Sure , but tone might be very

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , you 're " mm - hmm " tone is going to be very different .

dialogue type : s
A :  You could imagine doing specialized ones for different types of backchannels , if you could if you had a good model for it .

dialogue type : s
A :  Your " mm - hmm " detector .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  It would be interesting , though , to talk , maybe not at the meeting , but at some other time about what are the classes .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Yeah , it would be interesting .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , I mean we 're also talking about a couple of different things .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , one is your analysis window and then the other is any sort of normalization that you 're doing .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the And they could be quite different .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well we 're not any time soon going to get a forced alignment .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  Um If it 's not hand - marked then we 're not going to get the times .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean w I guess we could do a very bad one with Broadcast News .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  That might be good enough .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 'd be worth a try .

dialogue type : s
A :  It would be interesting to see what we get .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Yeah Right .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  Forms Next iteration of forms .

dialogue type : s^t1
A :  Oops .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  Nope .

dialogue type : s
A :  One 's a digit form ,

dialogue type : s
A :  one 's a speaker form .

dialogue type : s
A :  So one is a one time only speaker form and the other is the digits .

dialogue type : s^co
A :  So don't fill these out .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  This is just the suggestion for uh what the new forms would look like .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , they incorporate the changes that we talked about .

dialogue type : qw^d
A :  On which one ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Oh you mean on the digit form ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh , because the user fills out the first three fields and I fill out the rest .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  So it was intentional .

dialogue type : sj^ba^rt
A :  It 's an interesting observation ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but it was intentional .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  Because the date is when you actually read the digits and the time and ,

dialogue type : s^fa
A :  excuse me ,

dialogue type : s^bsc
A :  the time is when you actually read the digits , but I 'm filling out the date beforehand .

dialogue type : s
A :  If you look at the form in front of you ? that you 're going to fill out when you read the digits ? you 'll see I 've already filled in the date but not the time .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah , I 've noticed that in the forms .

dialogue type : s
A :  The the reason I put the time in , is so that the person who 's extracting the digits , meaning me , will know where to look in the meeting , to try to find the digits .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  I know .

dialogue type : s
A :  And I haven't said anything .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
A :  No , it 's about fifty fifty .

dialogue type : s^bsc
A :  Actually it 's about one third each .

dialogue type : s
A :  About one third of them are blank ,

dialogue type : s
A :  about one third of them are when the digits are read ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and about one third of them are when the meeting starts .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  I could put instructions ?

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  Nah .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  But if I 'm not at the meeting , I can't do that .

dialogue type : fg|s^rt
A :  Yep , but that is the reason Name , Email and Time are where they are .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  And then the others are later on .

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw^br
A :  What ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  What which form are you talking about ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh you 're talking about the digit form .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bd^rt
A :  No , that 's alright .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  The digit form doesn't have a " for official use only " line .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  It just has a line , which is what you 're supposed to read .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  So on the digits form , everything above the line is a fill - in form

dialogue type : s
A :  and everything below the line is digits that the user reads .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
A :  No , either way is fine

dialogue type : s
A :  I just You just started talking about something , and I didn't know which form you were referring to .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Just as uh as I have for all the others .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  That 's because the one , the digit form that has native language is the old form

dialogue type : s
A :  not the new form .

dialogue type : fg|s^rt
A :  Yeah this was the problem with these categories ,

dialogue type : s^df^rt
A :  I I picked those categories from TIMIT .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know what those are .

dialogue type : s^2^bu^rt
A :  With TIMIT ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  yeah ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  So , I was gonna ask

dialogue type : %-
A :  wh w I mean .

dialogue type : qw
A :  So so what accent are we speaking ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^g^rt
A :  Western ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  Yeah , I mean you could call it whatever you want .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  For the foreign language we couldn't classify every single one .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I just left it blank and you can put whatever you want .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  So I 'm not sure what to do about the Region field for English variety .

dialogue type : s
A :  You know , when I wrote I was writing those down , I was thinking , " You know , these are great if you 're a linguist " .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  But I don't know how to I don't know how to I don't know how to categorize them .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  So I guess my only question was if if you were a South Midland speaking region , person ? Would you know it ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is that what you would call yourself ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  Well , We I think we don't want to get that level of detail at this form .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  I think that 's alright if we want to follow up .

dialogue type : %--
A :  But .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Yeah , so I picked these regions cuz we had talked about TIMIT ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and those are right from TIMIT .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Yeah , I certainly don't .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I mean , I was saying I don't even know what I speak .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Am I speaking Am I speaking Western ?

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Northwest ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , so this is a real problem .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know what to do about it .

dialogue type : %-
A :  I c

dialogue type : s
A :  I think at the first level , for example , we speak the same .

dialogue type : s
A :  our our dialects Or whatever you region are the same .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  But I don't know what it is .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^m^rt
A :  a techno - speak accent ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^j^rt
A :  A a geek region ?

dialogue type : s
A :  No problem .

dialogue type : s^fe^j^m^t3
A :  There are hardly any subjects from " beep "

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah really .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , I like the idea of asking " what variety of English do you speak " as opposed to where you 're from

dialogue type : s^df:qr
A :  Because th if we start asking where we 're from , again you have to start saying , " well , is that the language you speak or is that just where you 're from ? "

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : fg|s:s
A :  I mean . So so I would say Germany

dialogue type : qh
A :  You know am I speaking with German accent

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  I don't think so .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , OK yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Yeah , I guess I could try to put squeeze in a little map .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean there 's not a lot of r of room

dialogue type : s
A :  I think of those , Northern is the only one that I don't even know what they 're meaning .

dialogue type : b.x
A :  Ye

dialogue type : s
A :  I don't think the Northwest people speak any differently than I do .

dialogue type : qy^d.%--
A :  That that 's

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  exactly what we 're arguing about .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  We don't know .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean some of them are very obvious .

dialogue type : s
A :  If you if you talk to someone speaking with Southern drawl , you know .

dialogue type : s^aa^m
A :  Or Boston , yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  But is Boston New England ?

dialogue type : s
A :  W I guess that 's the problem with these categories .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
A :  OK , so . I propose , take out Northern add , don't know .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  So you want to change the instructions also not just say region ?

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  I don't know

dialogue type : s^df:qw
A :  if I if I read this form , I think they 're going to ask it they 're going to answer the same way if you say , " What 's variety of English do you speak ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Region . "

dialogue type : s:qw
A :  as if you say " what variety of region region do you speak ?

dialogue type : s:s
A :  Please characterize your accent ? "

dialogue type : sj
A :  They 're going to answer the same way .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well what we talked about with that is is so that they would understand the granularity .

dialogue type : s^df^ng
A :  I mean that 's what I had before , and you told me to list the regions to list them .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean I had it wide open last week and and you said TIMIT .

dialogue type : s^ng
A :  That 's what the " Other " is for .

dialogue type : qy^ng
A :  Won't they answer the same thing ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean that 's why I put the " Other " in .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I mean , I I mean the way I had it last time was Region was blank ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  it just said Region colon .

dialogue type : sj
A :  And and I think that that 's the best way to do it ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because because of the problems we 're talking about

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but what we said last week , was no , put in a list ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so I put in a list .

dialogue type : qy.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aap
A :  Well , certainly dropping " Northern " I think is right , because none of us know what that is .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is " Midwest " one word ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  But that 's true of New England too .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Well , I shouldn't say that .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I have no clue .

dialogue type : s
A :  I was going to say the only one that doesn't have a huge variety is New York City .

dialogue type : s^df^no
A :  But I have no idea whether it does or not .

dialogue type : s
A :  I think that that was what happened with TIMIT , was that it was an analyst .

dialogue type : s
A :  New England

dialogue type : s^fe
A :  Oh , no .

dialogue type : s
A :  " Other " ,

dialogue type : s
A :  it goes under " Other " ,

dialogue type : s
A :  definitely under " Other " .

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK . So .

dialogue type : s^tc
A :  Another suggestion .

dialogue type : s
A :  Rather than have circle fill in forms , say " Region , open paren , E G Southern comma Western comma close paren colon . "

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Actually , maybe we do one non - English one as well .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  Southern , Cockney ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is that a real accent ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  How do you spell it ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  N E

dialogue type : s
A :  OK , we 'll do it that way .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Actually , I like that a lot .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Because that get 's at both of the things we were trying to do ,

dialogue type : s
A :  the granularity , and the person can just self - assess and we don't have to argue about what these regions are .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  Yep , just which one .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  I think that 's fine .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt
A :  Um , did you guys get my email on the multitrans ?

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah . So . So . I I have a version also which actually displays all the channels .

dialogue type : s
A :  But it 's hideously slow .

dialogue type : s
A :  The what the ones I applied , that you can actually do are Dan 's , because it doesn't slow it down .

dialogue type : s
A :  Just uses a lot of memory .

dialogue type : s
A :  No , the the one that 's installed is fine .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's not slow at all .

dialogue type : s
A :  I wrote another version . Which , instead of having the one pane with the one view , It has multiple panes with the views .

dialogue type : s
A :  But the problem with it is the drawing of those waveforms is so slow that every time you do anything it just crawls .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  It 's really bad .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  As you play , as you move , as you scroll .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Just about anything , and it it was so slow it was not usable .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that 's why I didn't install it and didn't pursue it .

dialogue type : fg|sj
A :  So . I think that the one Dan has is usable enough .

dialogue type : s
A :  It doesn't display the others .

dialogue type : s
A :  It displays just the mixed signal .

dialogue type : s
A :  But you can listen to any of them .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
A :  No , he suggested that , but he didn't It 's not installed .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No . No .

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  Um , not if we 're going to use Tcl - TK At least not if we 're going to use Snack .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  I mean you would have to do something ourselves .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A :  I mean .

dialogue type : s^aap
A :  We we could do that but that would mean changing the code .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean this isn't a program we wrote .

dialogue type : s
A :  This is a program that we got from someone else , and we 've done patches on .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  Not easily .

dialogue type : s^aap^df
A :  I mean y yes we could do that .

dialogue type : s
A :  You could you can write widgets in C .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Let 's try it with Dan 's and if that isn't enough , we can do it otherwise .

dialogue type : sj|s^df
A :  I think it is , cuz when I was playing with it , the mixed signal has it all in there .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so it 's really It 's not too bad to find places in the in the stream where things are happening .

dialogue type : sj
A :  So I I don't think it 'll be bad .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Depends on how much work they did .

dialogue type : s
A :  I think if if if one of us sat down and coded it , so that it could be displayed fast enough I 'm sure they would be quite willing to incorporate it .

dialogue type : s
A :  But it 's not a trivial task .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt^t^tc
A :  anyway , shall we do digits ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qr.%--
A :  Well , you want to go first ? Or .

dialogue type : qr
A :  Do you wanna go do digits or do you wanna just skip digits ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^co^t
A :  Then Alright . You go ahead .

dialogue type : qh^co
A :  Why don't you read the digits ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s^co
A :  Yeah , don't Don't read the old one .

dialogue type : z
A :  OK

dialogue type : z
A :  And
