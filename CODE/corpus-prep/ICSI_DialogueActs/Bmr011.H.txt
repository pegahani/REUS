H :  Does everyone has everyone met Don ?

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : b
H :  OK .

dialogue type : s
H :  Dome

dialogue type : s^cs^na
H :  yeah , it sounds like a topic of conversation .

dialogue type : b
H :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|%-
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Right ,

dialogue type : s
H :  so , uh , actually the way Jose is wearing his is is c correct .

dialogue type : s^e
H :  The good way .

dialogue type : s^co.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^na
H :  Yeah , th that 's good .

dialogue type : s
H :  So it 's towards the corner of your mouth so that breath sounds

dialogue type : s^co
H :  And then just sort of about , uh , a thumb or a thumb and a half away from your from your mouth .

dialogue type : s
H :  And this one isn't very adjustable ,

dialogue type : s
H :  so this about as good as I can get

dialogue type : s
H :  cuz it 's a fixed boom .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
H :  Well the onl the only problem with that is right now , um , some of the Jimlets aren't working .

dialogue type : s^e
H :  The little the boxes under the table .

dialogue type : s
H :  And so , w Uh , I 've only been able to find three jacks that are working .

dialogue type : fh
H : 

dialogue type : s^no
H :  I I 'm not sure I 'm follow .

dialogue type : s^co^rt
H :  Say that again ?

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
H :  OK , just two .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK .

dialogue type : b
H :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Right . OK .

dialogue type : s
H :  Sounds like uniformity wins .

dialogue type : fg
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^e
H :  Couple times .

dialogue type : qr
H :  What can I say .

dialogue type : qh
H :  Oh , really ?

dialogue type : s
H :  Yeah , I 'm not surprised .

dialogue type : s:s^fe
H :  I mean , " Baaah ! "

dialogue type : s^j
H :  Yeah , it 's an advantage when you don't breath .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  Yeah , I think that the point of doing the close talking mike is to get a good quality signal . We 're not doing research on close talking mikes .

dialogue type : s
H :  So we might as well get it as uniform as we can .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
H :  So I think just do a field trip at some point .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg
H :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
H :  So , as as I said , we 'll do a field trip and see if we can get all of the same mike that 's more comfortable than than these things , which I think are horrible .

dialogue type : fh
H :  So .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  And , you know , we 're researchers ,

dialogue type : s^j
H :  so we all have big heads .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  I was just thinking I should have invited him to this meeting .

dialogue type : s
H :  I forgot to do it .

dialogue type : fh
H :  So .

dialogue type : s^fa
H :  Sorry .

dialogue type : s^2
H :  HCC .

dialogue type : s^bu
H :  Oh , he 's doing array mikes .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  Yeah , that would be neat .

dialogue type : s^ng
H :  Well Dan Dan had worked on that . Dan Ellis ,

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
H :  So that that 's the cross - correlation stuff , was was doing b beam - forming .

dialogue type : s^ar
H :  No ,

dialogue type : s^nd
H :  he did start on it .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2^bk
H :  Oh , that 's another cl cue ,

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  that 's true .

dialogue type : s^2^j
H :  Or who talks the loudest .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Oh , so just morning .

dialogue type : qy.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  Ach ! I 'm blanking on the name of the project .

dialogue type : s
H :  NIST has has done a big meeting room instrumented meeting room with video and microphone arrays , and very elaborate software .

dialogue type : qy^rt
H :  Is is he the one working on that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK .

dialogue type : s
H :  I had read some papers that looked like they had already done some work .

dialogue type : b.%
H :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
H :  Oh , cuz what what I had read was , uh , they had a uh very large amount of software infrastructure for coordinating all this ,

dialogue type : s^e
H :  both in terms of recording and also live room where you 're interacting the participants are interacting with the computer , and with the video , and lots of other stuff .

dialogue type : fh
H :  So .

dialogue type : fg
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Alright .

dialogue type : s.%
H :  Xerox .

dialogue type : s
H :  And then they have little ones too

dialogue type : s
H :  but I mean but they don't have our block of wood ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
H :  right ?

dialogue type : s^ng
H :  It 's it 's just a lot of infrastructure that for our particular purpose we felt we didn't need to set up .

dialogue type : s
H :  That 's right , I mean if someone if someone came in and said we really want to do it ,

dialogue type : s
H :  I mean , we don't care .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  That would be fine ,

dialogue type : s
H :  Buy more disk space .

dialogue type : s
H :  I usually do a mix .

dialogue type : s
H :  Well their software infrastructure had a very elaborate design for plugging in filters , and mixers , and all sorts of processing .

dialogue type : s
H :  So that they can do stuff in real time and not save out each channel individually .

dialogue type : %--
H : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
H :  You mean to to actually get a microphone array and do that ?

dialogue type : qy^d^g.%--
H : 

dialogue type : fg|s^cs^ng
H :  Well , but I think we need a researcher here who 's interested in it . To push it along .

dialogue type : s^bc
H :  And we actually only have fifteen .

dialogue type : %--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  Details .

dialogue type : s
H :  But fifteen , not sixteen .

dialogue type : s
H :  And y it 'd certainly gets skew .

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : s^aap
H :  Or a hundred thirty - two .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
H :  Yes , absolutely . But it 's exactly the same problem ,

dialogue type : s
H :  that you have an infrastructure problem ,

dialogue type : s
H :  you have a problem with people not wanting to be video taped ,

dialogue type : s
H :  and you have the problem that no one who 's currently involved in the project is really hot to do it .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  I know .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
H :  Oh ! Probably not .

dialogue type : qy.%--
H :  Has Don have you s did you si

dialogue type : s
H :  I thought you did actually .

dialogue type : qy^rt
H :  Didn't you read a digit string ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
H :  Yeah , and you and you signed a form .

dialogue type : s
H :  I 'm pretty sure .

dialogue type : s^cc
H :  Well I 'll I 'll get another one before the end of the meeting .

dialogue type : s^ft^tc
H :  Thank you .

dialogue type : s
H :  Well I can't ,

dialogue type : s^df
H :  I 'm wired in .

dialogue type : %--
H :  or

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  It 's pretty good .

dialogue type : b
H :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy.%-
H : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
H :  Is ATLAS the his annotated transcription graph stuff ?

dialogue type : s^no.x
H :  I don't remember the acronym .

dialogue type : s.x
H :  The the one the what I think you 're referring to , they they have this concept of an an annotated transcription graph representation .

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  I based it on their work almost directly , in combination with the TEI stuff .

dialogue type : s
H :  And so it 's very , very similar .

dialogue type : s
H :  And so it 's it 's a data representation and a set of tools for manipulating transcription graphs of various types .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Right .

dialogue type : s
H :  Nu - it 's mostly it 's for their speech recognition products ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
H :  that they 've hired these people to do .

dialogue type : s^nd
H :  Well they they do send it out

dialogue type : s^e
H :  but my understanding is that that 's all this company does is transcriptions for IBM for their speech product .

dialogue type : s
H :  So most of it 's ViaVoice , people reading their training material for that .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yep ,

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  exactly .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yep .

dialogue type : b.%
H :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
H :  Well , but that 's OK , because , you know , you 'll do all them and then combine them .

dialogue type : s^nd
H :  No , no . We 're talking about close talking , not the not the desktop .

dialogue type : s^na
H :  I sure hope so .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  It 'd be really foolish to do otherwise .

dialogue type : s^2
H :  One side .

dialogue type : s
H :  But I mean we had this we 've had this discussion many times .

dialogue type : s
H :  And the answer is we don't actually know the answer because we haven't tried both ways .

dialogue type : fh
H :  So .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ng
H :  Well I think that that might change if you wanted really fine time markings .

dialogue type : fh
H :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Right .

dialogue type : s
H :  Oh , I 'd be curious to to look at that .

dialogue type : s
H :  They also all have h heavy accents .

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s^co
H :  Well we can talk about more details later .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt
H :  So , um , Liz , with with the SRI recognizer , can it make use of some time marks ?

dialogue type : s^no
H :  I I guess I don't know what that means .

dialogue type : s^m
H :  Adjusting . Oh .

dialogue type : s^2
H :  On Just on the marks .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
H :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Oh , I see ,

dialogue type : s^bs
H :  it 's for the length .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  I understand .

dialogue type : s^2
H :  It 's already chunked .

dialogue type : s^2
H :  Uh , it 's all pretty good sized for the recognizer also .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Right .

dialogue type : s^nd
H :  That 's what she 's saying , is that you can't .

dialogue type : s^2.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^aap.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^co
H :  We 'll have to talk to Brian .

dialogue type : s
H :  February sixteenth I think .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
H :  We had spoken with them about it .

dialogue type : qw
H :  Which one .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
H :  Yep , just features .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
H :  You mean non - ICSI ?

dialogue type : s^am
H :  Yeah , I guess you you can try

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : s^df
H :  The problem is so much of their stuff is confidential .

dialogue type : s^ng
H :  It would be very hard for them .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  Well , tha I think that 's her point .

dialogue type : s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
H :  You might give them a free lunch .

dialogue type : fg
H :  But , um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  it would be nice if we got someone other than me who knew how to set it up and could do the recording

dialogue type : s
H :  so u I didn't have to do it each time .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^co^j
H :  OK , next week you 're going to do it all .

dialogue type : s^ba^na
H :  It 's not that hard .

dialogue type : fg.%
H :  So .

dialogue type : s
H :  Well , I don't know if they meet regularly or not

dialogue type : s
H :  but they are no longer recording .

dialogue type : h|qw^t1
H :  Um , ugh , what was his name ?

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
H :  When with him gone , it sorta trickled off .

dialogue type : s
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
H :  Well he was sort of my contact ,

dialogue type : s
H :  so I just need to find out who 's running it now .

dialogue type : fh
H :  So .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
H :  Who 's willing to get recorded and distributed ?

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2^j
H :  Of beeps ,

dialogue type : b
H :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar|%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^2
H :  Legal .

dialogue type : fg
H : 

dialogue type : s^j
H :  Well if he meant and non - British I think we have zero .

dialogue type : qy^d^j^rt
H :  British is English ?

dialogue type : s^bc
H :  I bet he meant native speaking American .

dialogue type : qw
H :  So , why would he care ?

dialogue type : s
H :  I wonder if we have any .

dialogue type : s^am
H :  Maybe .

dialogue type : s^am
H :  Maybe .

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s^e
H :  you know , Dan wasn't there

dialogue type : s^e
H :  and before Jose started coming ,

dialogue type : fh
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
H :  RASTA . PLP .

dialogue type : s^j^r
H :  RASTA . PLP .

dialogue type : s
H :  Well , like computer science .

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : s^j.%
H :  Got a ticket .

dialogue type : s
H :  Well I had asked some some of the students at the business school .

dialogue type : s^cc.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s.%-
H :  The Business school .

dialogue type : s^cs^r
H :  Uh , the business school might be good .

dialogue type : s
H :  I actually spoke with some students up there

dialogue type : s^e
H :  and they they they expressed willingness back when they thought they would be doing more stuff with speech .

dialogue type : s
H :  But when they lost interest in speech they also stopped answering my email about other stuff ,

dialogue type : fh
H :  so .

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  We should probably bleep that out .

dialogue type : s^nd
H :  Th - that 's not what we want .

dialogue type : s^aa^j
H :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^j:s^co
H :  " Please throw everything in that direction . "

dialogue type : s
H :  Padded cell .

dialogue type : s
H :  There was a dorm room at Tech that , uh , someone had coated the walls and the ceiling , and , uh , the floor with mattresses .

dialogue type : s^e
H :  The entire room .

dialogue type : h|s
H :  Uh , Liz wanted to talk about methods of improving accuracy by doing pre - processing .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
H :  I am not sure how much that 's an issue with the close talking mikes ,

dialogue type : qh
H :  but who knows ?

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Right .

dialogue type : s^nd
H :  e I bet with the lapel mike there 's plenty , uh , room acoustic

dialogue type : fh|s^aap
H :  but I I think the rest is cross - talk .

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  So I I think it 's just ,

dialogue type : s^na
H :  yeah , what you said , cross - talk .

dialogue type : b.%
H :  Mm - hmm .
