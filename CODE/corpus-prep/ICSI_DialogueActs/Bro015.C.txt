dialogue type : s^tc
C :  Well , the news more specifically t for Aurora

dialogue type : fh
C :  um

dialogue type : s
C :  So I guess there was again a conference call but uh they are not decide on everything yet .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  For the VAD they probably they will do something like having some kind of idealized VAD that they could run on the channel zero of the SpeechDat - Car

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and then take the same um end points and apply them on channel one

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C :  Uh g

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Yeah , to the clean and take the end points for the noisy .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^am
C :  But I am not sure this is decided yet .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , probably uh s the same VAD for everybody .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^am
C :  Maybe .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Yeah , they 're still not decided .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Nothing much .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Probably the um these weight things , they will apply the same kind of weighting scheme for TI - digits than for the SpeechDat - Car .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So it would be weighting of

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  It would be an average of improvements rather than an average of word error rates which would make the more clean parts of TI - digits more important than they are right now .

dialogue type : %--
C :  This

dialogue type : s
C :  They they t I think they will tend to go this way , but hmm .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
C :  Yeah , if we have the result for the tandem with um MSG also

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So @ @ it was t

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah there is no surpri there is no surprise .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , so there is nor significant improvement .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um . Yeah , basically that 's all .

dialogue type : s
C :  We 've started to work on some kind of report for the work so we 've not much more results .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  It 's next week , yeah .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Sunil was working on this .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um . He sent a bunch of a bunch of results

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh

dialogue type : s
C :  but I don't know what 's the status of this .

dialogue type : s
C :  I guess it was just the result that he sent ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so . Um .

dialogue type : s
C :  He just used the spectral subtraction and the LDA filters I guess Mmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it was not better than what

dialogue type : s
C :  Then he tried to put the on - line normalization and it did not improve further ,

dialogue type : s
C :  putting the on - line normalization ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , we know most what we have to to put in in this .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So , I guess . Yeah , we m

dialogue type : h
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^no

C : 

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't know .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^arp
C :  I think it 's was playing with the number of states per word .

dialogue type : s
C :  They had sixteen , seventeen , eighteen .

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , because it was around between sixteen and twenty

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , apparently , um they had better results when they increased the number of states .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : z
C :  D ' you put two ?

dialogue type : z
C :  Oh , yeah .
