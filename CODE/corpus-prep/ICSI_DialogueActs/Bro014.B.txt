dialogue type : z
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : z
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK ,

dialogue type : qy^j^rt
B :  did you solve speech recognition last week ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Alright !

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Let 's do image processing .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
B :  Alright !

dialogue type : s
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's April fifth .

dialogue type : s
B :  Actually , Hynek should be getting back in town shortly if he isn't already .

dialogue type : h
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^j^na
B :  Well , we 'll drag him here .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  I know where he is .

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  U u u u uh , I meant , you know , this end of the world ,

dialogue type : s
B :  yeah , is really what I meant ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  uh , cuz he 's been in Europe .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
B :  Great !

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  I 'm sorry ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I didn't quite get that .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  There 's there 's four and there 's seven

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  I I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : qw
B :  But in HTK , what 's the difference between , uh , a an inner loop and an outer loop in these iterations ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , right !

dialogue type : s
B :  This was the mix up stuff .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  I remember now .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw^d.%--
B :  As opposed to ?

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's great .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
B :  Yeah . In fact , you could do something like keep exactly the same procedure and then add a fifth thing onto it

dialogue type : s
B :  that had more .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Might be between , uh , shared , uh shared variances or something ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : qo^tc
B :  So what else ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  Oh , this is a conference call for , uh , uh , Aurora participant sort of thing .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  Do you know who was who was since we weren't in on it , uh , do you know who was in from OGI ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Was was was Hynek involved

dialogue type : qrr
B :  or was it Sunil

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , you don't know .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , I mean , the fact that it 's inconsistent is an obvious mistake .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  I don't know

dialogue type : s
B :  I haven't thought it through ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^e
B :  it 's like if you say what 's the what 's the best way to do an average ,

dialogue type : qr^d
B :  an arithmetic average or a geometric average ?

dialogue type : s
B :  It depends what you wanna show .

dialogue type : s
B :  Each each one is gonna have a different characteristic .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  Well , they are doing that .

dialogue type : s
B :  No , that is relative .

dialogue type : qr
B :  But the question is , do you average the relative improvements or do you average the error rates and take the relative improvement maybe of that ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And the thing is it 's not just a pure average because there are these weightings .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's a weighted average .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , that 's what he 's seeing as one of the things they could do .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  It 's just when you when you get all done , I think that they pro

dialogue type : s
B :  I m I I wasn't there

dialogue type : s
B :  but I think they started off this process with the notion that you should be significantly better than the previous standard .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so they said " how much is significantly better ?

dialogue type : qw.%--
B :  what do you ? "

dialogue type : s
B :  And and so they said " well , you know , you should have half the errors , " or something , " that you had before " .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So it 's ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  But it does seem like

dialogue type : s^r
B :  i i it does seem like it 's more logical to combine them first

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
B :  Oh , yeah ?

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  Well , you know , the the thing is that if you look at the numbers on the on the more difficult cases , um , if you really believe that was gonna be the predominant use , none of this would be good enough .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  whereas you sort of with some reasonable error recovery could imagine in the better cases that these these systems working .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I think the hope would be that it would uh , it would work well for the good cases

dialogue type : s
B :  and , uh , it would have reasonable reas soft degradation as you got to worse and worse conditions .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  But but No .

dialogue type : s^ar
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar^r
B :  well , no .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , it isn't the operating theater .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , they don they they don't they don't really know , I think .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  I mean , I th

dialogue type : h|s^cs
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  to maybe have two or three numbers ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  you know ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and and and say here 's how much you , uh you improve the , uh the the relatively clean case

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bsc
B :  or or well - matched case ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  and here 's how here 's how much you ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , actually it 's true .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , I had forgotten this ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , but , uh , well - matched is not actually clean .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  What it is is just that ,

dialogue type : s^m^na
B :  u uh , the training and testing are similar .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I guess what you would do in practice is you 'd try to get as many , uh , examples of similar sort of stuff as you could ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  and then ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So the argument for that being the the the more important thing , is that you 're gonna try and do that , but you wanna see how badly it deviates from that when when when the , uh it 's a little different .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  That 's a that 's a that 's an arg

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  that 's an ar

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , that 's an argument for it ,

dialogue type : s^co
B :  but let me give you the opposite argument .

dialogue type : s
B :  The opposite argument is you 're never really gonna have a good sample of all these different things .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  I mean , are you gonna have w uh , uh , examples with the windows open ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  half open ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  full open ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Going seventy , sixty , fifty , forty miles an hour ?

dialogue type : s
B :  On what kind of roads ?

dialogue type : s
B :  With what passing you ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh , I mean ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I I I think that you could make the opposite argument that the well - matched case is a fantasy .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  You know ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I think the thing is is that if you look at the well - matched case versus the po you know , the the medium and the and the fo and then the mismatched case , um , we 're seeing really , really big differences in performance .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And and y you wouldn't like that to be the case .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , I don't remember the numbers right off ,

dialogue type : s^r
B :  but if you if you go from the well - matched case to the medium , it 's not an enormous difference in the in the the training - testing situation ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and and and it 's a really big performance drop .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  You know ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Yeah , I mean the reference one , for instance this is back old on , uh on Italian uh , was like six percent error for the well - matched

dialogue type : s
B :  and eighteen for the medium - matched

dialogue type : s
B :  and sixty for the for highly - mismatched .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and , you know , with these other systems we we helped it out quite a bit ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but still there 's there 's something like a factor of two or something between well - matched and medium - matched .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So you could argue , in fact , that the well - matched is something you shouldn't be looking at at all ,

dialogue type : s
B :  that that the goal is to come up with features that will still give you reasonable performance ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  you know , with again gentle degregra degradation ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
B :  um , even though the the testing condition is not the same as the training .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  I mean , what was the the medium - mismatch condition again ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's still the same same microphone in both cases ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  but , uh , it 's there 's a mismatch between the car conditions .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , you could argue that 's a pretty realistic situation

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  and , uh , I 'd almost argue for weighting that highest .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  They they compute the relative improvement first

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  and then average that with a weighting ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And so then the that that makes the highly - matched the really big thing .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
B :  so , u i since they have these three categories , it seems like the reasonable thing to do is to go across the languages and to come up with an improvement for each of those .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Just say " OK , in the in the highly - matched case this is what happens ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  in the m the , uh this other m medium if this happens ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  in the highly - mismatched that happens " .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  you should see , uh , a gentle degradation through that .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I gather that in these meetings it 's it 's really tricky to make anything ac make any policy change

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because everybody has has , uh , their own opinion

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
B :  So nobody would be there , probably . Right ?

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Good .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  Work to do .

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  So whose VAD

dialogue type : qy.%--
B :  is Is is this a ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Oh , I I think th that would be good .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , it 's not that the design of the VAD isn't important ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but it 's just that it it it does seem to be i uh , a lot of work to do a good job on on that

dialogue type : s^df
B :  and as well as being a lot of work to do a good job on the feature design ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
B :  if we can cut down on that maybe we can make some progress .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  sure .

dialogue type : %-
B :  But i

dialogue type : %-
B :  bu

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So y so you

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  m s Yeah ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Well , let 's say for ins

dialogue type : s
B :  see , MFCC for instance doesn't have anything in it , uh , related to the pitch .

dialogue type : s
B :  So just just for example .

dialogue type : s
B :  So suppose you 've that what you really wanna do is put a good pitch detector on there

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^r
B :  if it gets an unambiguous result then you 're definitely in a in a in a voice in a , uh , s region with speech .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , for the baseline .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So so if you use other features then y

dialogue type : s
B :  But it 's just a question of what is your baseline .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  What is it that you 're supposed to do better than ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  And so

dialogue type : s
B :  having the baseline be the MFCC 's means that people could choose to pour their ener their effort into trying to do a really good VAD

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  or tryi

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  They 're sort of separate .

dialogue type : s^arp
B :  Unfortunately there 's coupling between them ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which is part of what I think Stephane is getting to , is that you can choose your features in such a way as to improve the VAD .

dialogue type : s
B :  And you also can choose your features in such a way as to prove improve recognition .

dialogue type : s
B :  They may not be the same thing .

dialogue type : s^m^na
B :  You should do both

dialogue type : s
B :  and and I I think that this still makes I still think this makes sense as a baseline .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  you know , we had the MFCC 's before ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  lots of people have done voice activity detectors ,

dialogue type : s
B :  you might as well pick some voice activity detector and make that the baseline ,

dialogue type : s
B :  just like you picked some version of HTK and made that the baseline .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then let 's try and make everything better .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and if one of the ways you make it better is by having your features be better features for the VAD then that 's so be it .

dialogue type : %--
B :  But ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : s^bu^df
B :  cuz i i some of the some of the people didn't have a VAD at all , I guess .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  And and

dialogue type : s
B :  then they they looked pretty bad

dialogue type : s
B :  and and in fact what they were doing wasn't so bad at all .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I mean , it seems like ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it should include sort of the current state of the art that you want are trying to improve ,

dialogue type : s^na
B :  and MFCC 's , you know , or PLP or something it seems like reasonable baseline for the features ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  and anybody doing this task , uh , is gonna have some sort of voice activity detection at some level , in some way .

dialogue type : s
B :  They might use the whole recognizer to do it but rather than a separate thing ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but but they 'll have it on some level .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Well , I think people just had

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  it wasn't that they purposely brain - damaged it .

dialogue type : s^df^nd
B :  I think people hadn't really thought through about the , uh the VAD issue .

dialogue type : s
B :  And and then when the the the proposals actually came in and half of them had V A Ds and half of them didn't ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and the half that did did well

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and the half that didn't did poorly .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  When you say " we have that " , does Sunil have it now , too ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qw
B : 

dialogue type : qw
B :  how how much worse is it on the other conditions ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  when you say it 's a little worse ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  the latencies are much shorter .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  but you 've got the latency shorter now .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's better than the system that we had before .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that 's that 's all fine .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^co
B :  So let me try to understand .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
B :  When when you do these same improvements to proposal - one ,

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
B :  that , uh , on the i

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  things are somewhat better , uh , in proposal - two for the well - matched case

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  and somewhat worse for the other two cases .

dialogue type : qy.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : qy
B :  The th now that these other things are in there , is it the case maybe that the additions of proposal - two over proposal - one are less im important ?

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  I get it .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  There was a start of some effort on something related to voicing or something .

dialogue type : qy.%--
B :  Is that ?

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk.%--
B :  Yeah , w

dialogue type : s
B :  what yo what you 're calling the excitation , as I recall , is you 're subtracting the the , um the mel mel mel filter , uh , spectrum from the FFT spectrum .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's it 's not really an excitation ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but it 's something that hopefully tells you something about the excitation .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^arp
B :  Well , yeah , except the variance was big .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I mean , what w we we are coming up with feature sets after all .

dialogue type : s
B :  So another way of looking at it is that um , the mel cepstru mel spectrum , mel cepstrum , any of these variants , um , give you the smooth spectrum .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  It 's the spectral envelope .

dialogue type : s
B :  By going back to the FFT , you 're getting something that is more like the raw data .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : qw
B :  another way of looking at it is what characterization of the difference between the raw data and this smooth version is something that you 're missing that could help ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So , I mean , looking at different statistical measures of that difference ,

dialogue type : s
B :  coming up with some things and just trying them out

dialogue type : s
B :  and seeing if you add them onto the feature vector does that make things better or worse in noise ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  where you 're really just i i

dialogue type : s
B :  the way I 'm looking at it is not so much you 're trying to f find the best the world 's best voiced - unvoiced , uh , uh , classifier ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but it 's more that , you know , uh , uh , try some different statistical characterizations of that difference back to the raw data

dialogue type : fh
B :  and and

dialogue type : s
B :  m maybe there 's something there that the system can use .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Well , that 's the rea

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  w w what I 'm arguing is that 's

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , uh , what I 'm arguing is that that that 's givi you gives you your intuition .

dialogue type : s
B :  But in in reality , it 's you know , there 's all of this this overlap and so forth ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and But what I 'm saying is that may be OK ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because what you 're really getting is not actually voiced versus unvoiced ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  both for the fac the reason of the overlap and and then , uh , th you know , structural reasons ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  uh , uh , like the one that Chuck said ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  that that in fact , well , the data itself is that you 're working with is not perfect .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  So , what I 'm saying is maybe that 's not a killer

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because you 're just getting some characterization ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  one that 's driven by your intuition about voiced - unvoiced certainly ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but it 's just some characterization of something back in the in the in the almost raw data , rather than the smooth version .

dialogue type : s
B :  And your intuition is driving you towards particular kinds of , uh , statistical characterizations of , um , what 's missing from the spectral envelope .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , obviously you have something about the excitation ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and what is it about the excitation ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and , you know and you 're not getting the excitation anyway , you know .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s^cs^r
B :  uh , especially if if these trainings and so forth are faster , I would almost just take a uh , a scattershot at a few different ways of look of characterizing that difference

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
B :  and , uh , you could have one of them but and and see , you know , which of them helps .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , you have , uh , uh , variance only ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so it 's kind of like you 're just multiplying together these , um , probabilities from the individual features within each mixture .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  so ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , I know that , um , people doing some robustness things a ways back were were just doing just being gross and just throwing in the FFT

dialogue type : s
B :  and actually it wasn't wasn't wasn't so bad .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B :  Uh , so it would s

dialogue type : s
B :  and and you know that i it 's gotta hurt you a little bit to not have a a spectral , uh a s a smooth spectral envelope ,

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So you essentially take the values that th that you get from the triangular filter and extend them

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  to sor sort of like a rectangle , that 's at that m value .

dialogue type : b
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  No , it 's makes sense to look at low frequencies .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  I mean , i you could argue about whether it should be linear interpolation or or or or zeroeth order ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but but

dialogue type : s
B :  at any rate something like this is what you 're feeding your recognizer , typically .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , so the mel cepstrum is the is the is the cepstrum of this this , uh , spectrum or log spectrum ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qr
B :  You - you 're subtracting in in in power domain or log domain ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's sort of like division , when you do the yeah , the spectra .

dialogue type : h
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  But , anyway ,

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa^t3
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na^t3
B :  I guess that makes sense .

dialogue type : s^aa^t3
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Pitch .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's like fundamental frequency .

dialogue type : fg|%--
B :  So , I mean , i t t

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^co
B :  I mean , ignore all the details and all the ways which is that these are complete lies .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , the the you know , what you 're doing in feature extraction for speech recognition is you have , uh , in your head a a a a simplified production model for speech ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  in which you have a periodic or aperiodic source that 's driving some filters .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , first order for speech recognition , you say " I don't care about the source " .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And so you just want to find out what the filters are .

dialogue type : s
B :  The filters roughly act like a , um a , uh a an overall resonant you know , f some resonances and so forth that th that 's processing excitation .

dialogue type : s
B :  So if you look at the spectral envelope , just the very smooth properties of it , you get something closer to that .

dialogue type : s
B :  And the notion is if you have the full spectrum , with all the little nitty - gritty details , that that has the effect of both ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and it would be a multiplication in in frequency domain

dialogue type : s^e
B :  so that would be like an addition in log power spectrum domain .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so this is saying , well , if you really do have that sort of vocal tract envelope , and you subtract that off , what you get is the excitation .

dialogue type : s
B :  And I call that lies because you don't really have that ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  you just have some kind of signal - processing trickery to get something that 's kind of smooth .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  It 's not really what 's happening in the vocal tract

dialogue type : s^df
B :  so you 're not really getting the vocal excitation .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  That 's why I was going to the why I was referring to it in a more a more , uh , uh , conservative way ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it 's the excitation " .

dialogue type : s
B :  But it 's not really the excitation .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So so , stand standing back from that , you sort of say there 's this very detailed representation .

dialogue type : s
B :  You go to a smooth representation .

dialogue type : s^df^r
B :  You go to a smooth representation cuz this typically generalizes better .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but whenever you smooth you lose something ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so the question is have you lost something you can you use ?

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
B :  Um , probably you wouldn't want to go to the extreme of just ta saying " OK , our feature set will be the FFT " ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz we really think we do gain something in robustness from going to something smoother ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but maybe there 's something that we missed .

dialogue type : qw
B :  So what is it ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And then you go back to the intuition that ,

dialogue type : s
B :  well , you don't really get the excitation ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but you get something related to it .

dialogue type : s
B :  And it and as you can see from those pictures , you do get something that shows some periodicity , uh , in frequency ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  you know ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and and and also in time .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B :  so ,

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Yeah , maybe .

dialogue type : s^bd
B :  Well , I mean it looks better ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but , I mean , the thing is if if , uh if you 're actually asking you know , if you actually j uh , need to do place along an FFT , it may be it may be pushing things .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  The spectral subtraction is being done

dialogue type : qw
B :  at what level ? Is it being done

dialogue type : qy^e^rt
B :  at the level of FFT bins

dialogue type : qrr^e^rt
B :  or at the level of , uh , mel spectrum or something ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  I mean , how are they doing it ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So in that case , it might not make much difference at all .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Maybe .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I mean , certainly it 'd be better .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qo^tc
B :  What else ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy
B :  Uh , has has anything happened yet on this business of having some sort of standard , uh , source ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B :  or ?

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  Early June ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  late June ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  middle June ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  and he 's been doing all the talking

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  This is this by the way a bad thing .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  We 're trying to get , um , m more female voices in this record as well .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Make sur make sure Carmen talks as well .

dialogue type : fh|qy^rt
B :  Uh , but has he pretty much been talking about what you 're doing also ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah , well .

dialogue type : s
B :  You know , uh , we 'll get we 'll get to , uh , Spanish voices sometime ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and we do we want to recognize , uh , you too .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  Oh , no .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^j
B :  w we are we 're in the , uh , Bourlard - Hermansky - Morgan , uh , frame of mind .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  Yeah , we like high error rates .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^j
B :  That way there 's lots of work to do .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B :  Uh ,

dialogue type : qy^d.%--
B :  anything to

dialogue type : qy^d
B :  talk about ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  This is in order to use the SRI system or something .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
B :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  certainly in a short short - term this just sounds easier .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I mean , longer - term if it 's if it turns out to be useful , one one might want to do something else ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , uh , I mean , in in other words , you you may be putting other kinds of errors in from the re - synthesis process .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s
B :  Uh , it depends what you what you do .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I mean , it 's it 's it 's , uh ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^no
B :  Don't know .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  But anyway it sounds like a reasonable way to go for a for an initial thing ,

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  and we can look at at exactly what you end up doing

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and and then figure out if there 's some something that could be be hurt by the end part of the process .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  That was it , huh ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qo
B :  Um , anything to add ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Sure .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , this sort of goes back to earlier stuff by Drullman .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  But , I guess , I thought you had brought this up in the context of , um , targets somehow .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  But i m

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  i it 's not I mean , they 're sort of not in the same kind of category as , say , a phonetic target or a syllabic target

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  or a feature or something .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , that 's sort of what MSG does .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Anyway , we 'll talk more about it later .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  So maybe , le

dialogue type : s^co^na
B :  let 's do digits .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Let you you start .
