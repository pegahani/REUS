dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  um

dialogue type : fh
B :  the

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh ,

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  what 's the right word ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I had to put everything out

dialogue type : s^e
B :  to to put the removable hard disk in

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  but i but it 's not not , um very , uh difficult or something like that .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Uh !

dialogue type : s
B :  So Wilbert will set up the second computer .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's about one hour to put this , uh hard disk in

dialogue type : s
B :  and a further hour to , uh Well , two or three hours to install the operating systems .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  At the moment .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  um On Friday when I installed , um uh Linux the first time I got access to the local network here , um , but not to any machines outside of , uh , ICSI .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , till Monday there 's no access at all to any machines ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  also not to inside machines .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , I think it 's related to the work , um they 've done on Sunday here

dialogue type : s.%-

B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
B :  But , uh

dialogue type : s^co
B :  your argument is , uh , I think it we have to have the right to change it .

dialogue type : s^co^df
B :  So if there 's anything changing in insurances or something something like that , that we have access to this page further on to chan to make any changes .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ng
B :  Yeah , but it 's much more complicated .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I think the best solution is really to put a link on the ICSI page to this stuff .

dialogue type : s
B :  And the stuff itself is , uh , located at our server .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^m^na
B :  in our directory ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : h|s^no
B :  Um , I don't know .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Maybe it could be a good thing if we have such an event button that , um , somewhere beneath this button or wherever , that there 's a date , when the last update was .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  So that you know it 's worth to click this button to see there 's a new , um , announcement or not .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  S So otherwise , you are often clicking this button

dialogue type : s^df
B :  and you get your old information or even an uh empty page .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
B :  something like that .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  " Last updated " ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's just a su suggestion

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't know how easy it is to to implement something like that .

dialogue type : s
B :  Holidays

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  And there 's no final master 's thesis or something like that what they have to perform ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Well

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No , no , no , no , no .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  So I will stay here till the end of February

dialogue type : fh
B :  and

dialogue type : s
B :  afterwards , um , at Berlin I 'm yeah , funded by an institution of the German government ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  they are paying me ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and I have to do research for them , of course .

dialogue type : s
B :  I have to um well , uh , reach some goals and so on .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  But on the other hand there will be some time left I think to do some work on this area I started here .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  And for me , myself , I 'm also very interested in in continue this work

dialogue type : s
B :  and so that will be manageable

dialogue type : fh
B :  and , um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  well ,

dialogue type : s
B :  at the moment it 's quite difficult to find students , eh , who are doing their master 's thesis and so on

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because there are not a lot of students , uh , which are in this state in Germany now ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  about two years ago the numbers of students were , um , studying computer science , uh , started to increase again

dialogue type : s
B :  and so in one or two years we will have , uh , many students , uh , which are performing their master 's thesis

dialogue type : s
B :  and so I think there will also be , uh , many students which are joining in this work .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  So , hopefully , uh , I will found will find some students which are joining in

dialogue type : fh
B :  and , um

dialogue type : s
B :  So , hopefully this work will be go on .

dialogue type : z
B :  That 's it .
