G :  No .

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Um , I don't think they 're designed to be over your ears .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
G :  But I definitely haven't figured it out .

dialogue type : s
G :  " Sip , sigh . "

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : %--
G :  u

dialogue type : s^na
G :  usually we 've done that

dialogue type : s
G :  and also we 've s done digits as well ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but I forgot to print any out .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Besides with this big a group ,

dialogue type : s.%
G :  it would take too much time .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df^nd
G :  Yeah , but it takes too much time .

dialogue type : s
G :  Uh , especially for querying .

dialogue type : s
G :  Landay . James .

dialogue type : s^df^nd
G :  But if we had the CrossPads , we could ask people , you know , if if something comes up write it down and mark it somehow ,

dialogue type : s^f
G :  you know .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  But that 's alright .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  I don't think there 'd be so many that you couldn't have someone clean it up

dialogue type : s^e
G :  pretty easily .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  And I 'm Adam Janin on channel A .

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt
G :  And , uh , do you want to do the P D As and the P Z

dialogue type : s
G :  Far .

dialogue type : s
G :  Yeah , and eventually once this room gets a little more organized , the Jimlets will be mounted under the table ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and these guys will be permanently mounted somehow .

dialogue type : s
G :  You know , probably with double - sided tape ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  but So .

dialogue type : s
G :  You So we won't have to go through that .

dialogue type : s^aap
G :  Well , that was just one of the reasons .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
G :  But , yeah , definitely .

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , I asked them to

dialogue type : s
G :  and none of them did .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  So , I I asked them to send me ideas for queries after the meeting

dialogue type : s
G :  and no one ever did .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
G :  I didn't follow up either .

dialogue type : s^bd^e:s
G :  So I didn't track them down and say " please do th do it now " .

dialogue type : s
G :  But , uh , no one spontaneously provided anything .

dialogue type : s^df^no:s
G :  I just don't know how else to generate the queries other than getting an expert to actually listen to the meeting and say " that 's important ,

dialogue type : s^df^e:s
G :  that might be a query " .

dialogue type : s^aap
G :  I mean , that gives you a summary

dialogue type : s^nd.%--
G : 

dialogue type : qh^df^ng
G :  How do you generate queries from that ?

dialogue type : s
G :  Uh , James and I were talking about this during one of the breaks .

dialogue type : s
G :  And the problem with that is , I 'm definitely going to do something with information retrieval

dialogue type : s^e
G :  even if it 's sort of not full full - bore what I 'm gonna do for my thesis .

dialogue type : s
G :  I 'm gonna do something .

dialogue type : s
G :  I 'm not gonna do anything with summarization .

dialogue type : s
G :  And so if someone wants to do that , that 's fine ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but it 's not gonna be me .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : %
G :  Uh , y

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , i this would tell you what the hit is ,

dialogue type : s
G :  not what the query is .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  And so you could you can generate a query from the hits ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^ba^nd
G :  Yeah , I think that 's difficult

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because then they 're not gonna ask the questions that are in the summary .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
G :  th Yeah , I think it has to be a participant .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , it doesn't have to be .

dialogue type : s
G :  OK . So that that is another use of Meeting Recorder that we haven't really talked about ,

dialogue type : s
G :  which is for someone else ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  as opposed to as a remembrance agent ,

dialogue type : s
G :  which is what had been my primary thought in the information retrieval part of it would be .

dialogue type : fh
G :  But , uh ,

dialogue type : s
G :  I guess if you had a meeting participant , they could use the summary to refresh themselves about the meeting and then make up queries .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I don't know how to do it if until you have a system .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
G :  Yeah , that that 's what I was saying .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  But at least it would get us started .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^ba^df^ng
G :  Although it seems like that 's , um , a high burden on the note - taker .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  That 's a pretty fine grain that the note - taker will have to take .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^nd
G :  Well , I think that 's a little bit of a problem .

dialogue type : s
G :  Their sort of note - taking application stuff

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  they 've been doing for the last couple of years ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and I don't think anyone is still working on it .

dialogue type : s
G :  I think they 're done .

dialogue type : s
G :  Um , so I 'm not sure that they have anyone currently working on notes .

dialogue type : s
G :  So what we 'd have to interest someone in is the combination of note and speech .

dialogue type : qh
G :  And so the question is " is there such a person ? "

dialogue type : s
G :  And I think right now , the answer is " no " .

dialogue type : s^ng
G :  We 'll just have to see .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
G :  Yeah , absolutely . Then you want to have it .

dialogue type : s
G :  By hand .

dialogue type : s^2
G :  Minutes .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  Never .

dialogue type : s^na^r|s^na
G :  Never . I 've never seen it at ICSI .

dialogue type : qo.%--
G :  Does anyone ?

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , Dan is the one who who most frequently would take notes ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : qy^bh
G :  Oh , really ?

dialogue type : s^na|s^2
G :  That 's true are four or five people .

dialogue type : s^2
G :  Culture .

dialogue type : s^ng.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  There 's uh a person with a laptop at each meeting .

dialogue type : s
G :  There are more .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , there are ten - ish .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  They 're very sparse .

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Yeah . This is something early in the project we talked a lot about .

dialogue type : s^aap|s^df^nd
G :  I agree , but but you you just you g end up with video ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and and instrumented rooms .

dialogue type : s
G :  And that 's a different project , I think .

dialogue type : s^aa|%-
G : 

dialogue type : qh^df.%-
G : 

dialogue type : qh^df.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Huh .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^df^nd
G :  But I think adding photographs adds a whole nother level of problems .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^df^ng
G :  But that it 's gonna be a lot of effort on our part to create it , and store it ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and get all the standards , and to do anything with it .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
G :  Low fidelity .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Well , once the room is a little more fixed that 's a little easier

dialogue type : s^df.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , the wireless .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na^rt
G :  I I I don't disagree .

dialogue type : s
G :  I think that if you have that , then people who are interested in vision can use this database . The problem with it is you 'll have more people who don't want to be filmed than who don't want to be recorded .

dialogue type : s^df^e:s
G :  So that there 's going to be another group of people who are gonna say " I won't participate " .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^df^nd
G :  But , you know , that 's a lot of infrastructure and work .

dialogue type : s^df^e^rt
G :  To set it up and then anonymize it ?

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt^t3
G :  Couldn't find it ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^e^rt^t3
G :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^nd.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
G :  er , if we weren't recording this , this this would get lost . Right ?

dialogue type : s
G :  The point is that we 're not saving it anyway .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^e
G :  In in our real - life setting .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , uh , in that case we don't need to take pictures of it .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
G :  And and they seem to not be able to give enough of them away ,

dialogue type : s
G :  so we could probably get more as well .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^no
G :  Yeah , I 'm not sure .

dialogue type : s
G :  I think it it it will again depend on Landay ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and if he has a student who 's interested ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and how much infrastructure we 'll need .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , if it 's easy , we can just do it .

dialogue type : s
G :  Um , but if it requires a lot of our time , we probably won't do it .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
G :  Yeah . Yeah , we have to sort of figure out what we 're gonna do .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
G :  Right . I ag I think I agree with that .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  I think , though , the importance marking is a good idea , though .

dialogue type : s^e
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Do it on pilots or laptops or something .

dialogue type : s^j:s^cs
G :  OK , if something 's important everyone clap .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
G :  Yeah . Um , I think that 's right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
G :  Oh , OK . That 's fine .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Yeah . What I was gonna say is that I don't want to ask people to do something they wouldn't normally do in a meeting .

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's ver I just want to keep away from the artificiality .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  But I think it definitely

dialogue type : s
G :  if they exist .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  And then Jane 's idea of summarization afterward I think is not a bad one .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
G :  picking out basically to let you pick out keywords ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  um , and , uh , construct queries .

dialogue type : s
G :  People in the meeting .

dialogue type : s
G :  You know , just at at the end of the meeting , before you go ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  go around the table .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Ugh .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2^bu^d^rt
G :  And see score them ?

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Hmm .

dialogue type : %--
G :  I d

dialogue type : fg|s

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %
G :  fff !

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt
G :  Maybe e Is email easier ?

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , I when you first said do do it , um , spoken , what I was thinking is , oh then people have to come up

dialogue type : s
G :  and you have to hook them up to the recorder .

dialogue type : s
G :  So , if they 're already here I think that 's good ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but if they 're not already here for I 'd rather do email .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  I 'm much faster typing than anything else .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bd^no
G :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^2.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^na:s
G :  Yeah , read the digits ,

dialogue type : s^na:s
G :  do the summary .

dialogue type : s^t3
G :  God , that 's bugging me .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Can we turn that light off ?

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa|%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Very annoying .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Oh , much better .

dialogue type : s^j
G :  Too much caffeine .

dialogue type : s
G :  I thought it was the projector for a moment .

dialogue type : s:qw
G :  It was like , " what 's going on ? "

dialogue type : s
G :  We we 've just been talking , how do we generate queries ?

dialogue type : s
G :  And so that was one suggestion .

dialogue type : qw
G :  And what ?

dialogue type : s^aap|s^aa
G :  At least . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu^e
G :  m i Even if that much ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Less .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
G :  Well , in answer to " is it Landay 's problem ? " ,

dialogue type : s
G :  um , he doesn't have a student who 's interested right now in doing anything .

dialogue type : s
G :  So he has very little manpower .

dialogue type : s
G :  Um , there 's very little allocated for him

dialogue type : s
G :  and also he 's pretty focused on user interface .

dialogue type : s
G :  So I don't think he wants to do information retrieval ,

dialogue type : s
G :  query generation , that sort of stuff .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Or or just a memory refresher .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
G :  Yep . I agree .

dialogue type : s^t3
G :  We 're still here .

dialogue type : s
G :  As many are willing to do it .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^bd
G :  I mean , I we didn't take minutes and we don't have summaries .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  But , uh , people could , like , listen to them a little bit and generate some queries .

dialogue type : s
G :  Of course Jane doesn't need to .

dialogue type : s
G :  I 'm sure you have that meeting memorized by now .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^ng
G :  Or want to get up and leave .

dialogue type : s^2:s
G :  Me too , me too , me too .

dialogue type : %-
G :  Well ,

dialogue type : s
G :  you have the other thing , that that they know why we 're doing it .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  We 'll I mean , we 'll we 'll be telling them that the reason we 're trying to do this is is to d generate queries in the future ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  so try to pick things that other people didn't say .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-:s.%-
G :  Yeah , like Jim Bass says " add a few lines on dialogue in your next perf "

dialogue type : s
G :  But that that 's gonna be very hard to generate .

dialogue type : %-

dialogue type : s
G :  But what 's interesting to me may not b have been interesting to you .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s

dialogue type : qy^d^g

dialogue type : s
G :  W we just need to start somewhere .

dialogue type : b
G :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
G :  Importance ?

dialogue type : s^arp:s
G :  I wouldn't even say that " that they learned " .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Uh , you might want to mention something that that you brought up .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : %--
G :  n

dialogue type : s
G :  I think that 's gonna predominantly end up being whoever takes down the equipment then .

dialogue type : fh|s^t1
G :  Yeah , that would be , let 's see , me .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
G :  Give them a reward ,

dialogue type : qy^cs^d^j
G :  a dollar a query ?

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs
G :  Absolutely . So I think we 're gonna have to start with keywords

dialogue type : s^cs^e
G :  and and if someone becomes more interested we could work our way up .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : qy^bh
G :  Really ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^na
G :  Oh , that 's true .

dialogue type : fg|s^df
G :  Yeah , I was thinking about Wizard of Oz ,

dialogue type : s^bd
G :  but it requires the wizard to know all about the meetings .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
G :  Oh , yeah . I I understand .

dialogue type : s
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
G :  But that neither could anyone else , though , is what , uh , my point is .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df
G :  Right . Since we have the transcript .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
G :  Dates maybe .

dialogue type : s^bd^no
G :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
G :  That 's something I always forget .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^aa|qy
G :  Sure . Can you hand me my note pad ?

dialogue type : s^ft^t3

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^t

dialogue type : s^df
G :  My July is really very crowded .

dialogue type : s.%-

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na

dialogue type : s
G :  Dot Berkeley dot EDU , of course .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^rt
G :  Oh , is this IBM ?

dialogue type : fg|qw
G :  Uh , so do they How are they gonna do the multi - channel ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  I thought so .

dialogue type : qy^2^bu^d
G :  Mix ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
G :  OK . That 's , uh , my question .

dialogue type : s
G :  So we 'll give them all sixteen channels

dialogue type : s
G :  and they 'll do whatever they want with it .

dialogue type : s^ba^ng
G :  It 's not hard .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  So , sure .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^t^tc
G :  Not an immediate action item but something we do have to worry about is data formats for for higher - level information .

dialogue type : s^bsc
G :  Well , or d or not even higher level ,

dialogue type : s^bsc
G :  different level , prosody and all that sort of stuff .

dialogue type : s
G :  We 're gonna have to figure out how we 're gonna annotate that .

dialogue type : s^nd
G :  But that 's not That 's display .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  That 's different than format .

dialogue type : s
G :  Get my parents to do it .

dialogue type : s
G :  I think my father would last through the second prompt before he hang hung up .

dialogue type : s
G :  He would never use it .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw^rt
G :  What is it ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's a tape recorder .

dialogue type : s^j
G :  It 's eight tape recorders .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  Un - unfortunately Landay told me that Jason is not gonna be working on that anymore .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : qw

dialogue type : qrr^bu^d
G :  Landay or Jason ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  True .

dialogue type : s^na

dialogue type : s^arp^df
G :  Well , but that 's not very much .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  Yeah . Basically what his software does is h it picks out keywords and does a Google - like search .

dialogue type : s.%-

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Um , the " Georgia Tech Classroom Two Thousand " is a good one .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , Georgia Tech did a very elaborate instrumented room .

dialogue type : s
G :  And I want to try to stay away from that .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
G :  It 's also it 's not it 's not near - far , right ?

dialogue type : s
G :  I think @ @ gonna add that to one of my action items .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  Cuz I had thought they 'd only done far - field ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  intelligent - room sorts of things .

dialogue type : s^e^no
G :  I hadn't known that then they 'd done any more than that .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  I think everyone here is on the list .

dialogue type : s^nd

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^e

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^g^rt
G :  You are on it , aren't you ?

dialogue type : b
G :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s:qy
G :  " Psst . Want to buy a corpora ? "

dialogue type : s^na

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : fg
G :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  what I thought was interesting was the combination of the CrossPad and the speech .

dialogue type : s
G :  Especially , um , the interaction of them rather than just note - taking .

dialogue type : qh
G :  So , can you determine the interesting points by who 's writing ?

dialogue type : qh^e
G :  Can you do special gestures and so on that that have , uh , special meaning to the corpora ?

dialogue type : s
G :  I really liked that .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Did you take pictures of the boards ?

dialogue type : s^2|s^na
G :  To the pre previous meeting . That 's right .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Ah !

dialogue type : s
G :  I wonder if work 's already been done on it .

dialogue type : s^cs^j.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  That actually has come up a couple times in queries .

dialogue type : s
G :  I was talking to Landay

dialogue type : s
G :  and that was one of his examples .

dialogue type : s:qw
G :  When when did people laugh ?

dialogue type : s
G :  So we need a laugh detector .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Cuz that seems to be pretty common .

dialogue type : s^m^na
G :  Not in the congressional hearings .

dialogue type : s
G :  Quiet sobbing .

dialogue type : s^na
