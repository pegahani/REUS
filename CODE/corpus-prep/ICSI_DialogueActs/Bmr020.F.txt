F :  We can say the word " zero " all we want ,

dialogue type : z
F :  but just

dialogue type : z
F :  Curly brackets .

dialogue type : z
F :  Well ,

dialogue type : z
F :  correction for transcribers .

dialogue type : z
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
F :  u

dialogue type : z
F :  u

dialogue type : z
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : z
F :  I probably just should have left it on .

dialogue type : z
F :  Yeah I did have to run ,

dialogue type : z
F : 

dialogue type : z
F :  Well , I u I actually don't know what the default is anymore as to how we 're using the the front - end stuff but for for when we use the ICSI front - end ,

dialogue type : z
F :  but um ,

dialogue type : z
F :  there is an there is an o an option in in RASTA ,

dialogue type : z
F :  which ,

dialogue type : z
F :  um , in when I first put it in , uh , back in the days when I actually wrote things , uh , I did actually put in a random bit or so that was in it ,

dialogue type : z
F :  but then I realized that putting in a random bit was equivalent to adding uh adding flat spectrum ,

dialogue type : z
F :  and it was a lot faster to just add a constant to the to the spectrum . So then I just started doing that

dialogue type : z
F :  instead of calling " rand " or something ,

dialogue type : z
F :  so .

dialogue type : z
F :  So it d it does that .

dialogue type : s^fe^tc
F :  Gee ! Here we all are !

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt^t3
F :  There 's an agenda ?

dialogue type : fg|s^bu
F :  Uh , and you just sent off a Eurospeech paper ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , I guess you first you have to do the first one ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  Oh they they had some extension that they announced or something ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  Oh this isn't the Aurora one ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
F :  It 's another one ?

dialogue type : s^fe
F :  Oh !

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : fg
F :  Well ,

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well we have now ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Well .

dialogue type : s^j
F :  I mean I get these AARP things ,

dialogue type : s^j
F :  but I 'm not se really senior yet ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fg
F :  Um ,

dialogue type : qw^rt
F :  but uh , other than that delightful result , what was the rest of the paper about ?

dialogue type : s
F :  You sent it to me

dialogue type : s
F :  but I haven't seen it yet .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah , we we have pretty limited sample here .

dialogue type : qw
F :  But what was it like , say , in the Robustness meeting , for instance ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  Maybe ten percent ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Were you including the the lapel in this ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  And did the did did the la did the the problems with the lapel go away also ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  fray for for insertions ?

dialogue type : s^2
F :  Less so .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  i it 's the high signal - to - noise ratio

dialogue type : s^t3
F :  here that that helps you .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  But he yeah , he 's he 's right ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  y I mean maybe

dialogue type : s
F :  you weren't intending to pause at all ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but You were intending to stop for fifty - seven milliseconds ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but then Chuck came in

dialogue type : s
F :  and so you paused for a second

dialogue type : s^e
F :  or more .

dialogue type : b
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Huh .

dialogue type : s^j
F :  Actually for a lot of these people I think you could just sort of backchannel continuously

dialogue type : s^j
F :  and it would pretty much be fine .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  u R D RDR ,

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : qrr^bu
F :  Is that a dash or a dot in there ?

dialogue type : fg
F :  So ,

dialogue type : s
F :  that 's why it was good to have Andreas , say these things

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs^t^tc.%--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba^t3
F :  Uh , it looks much better .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  Yeah , if it 's working well ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  that sounds like a good idea

dialogue type : s^df
F :  since as you say you have to do stuff with the other end anyway .

dialogue type : s
F :  What 's the problem the l I forget .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Is the problem the lapel ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s^j
F :  the dead meetings .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I I I don't know .

dialogue type : s^aap
F :  It would be kind of quick

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  but they 're still listening to everything .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qw
F :  I mean , what 's the worst that happens ?

dialogue type : qy.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean as long as th on the other end they can say there 's there 's something conventions so that they say " huh ? "

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  and then we can flag those later .

dialogue type : %-
F :  i i It i

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  but but I I I have another suggestion on that , which is , since , really what this is , is is is trying to in the large , send the right thing to them and there is gonna be this this post - processing step ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  um ,

dialogue type : qh^cs
F :  why don't we check through a bunch of things by sampling it ?

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So y you do a bunch of meetings ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  you listen to to a little bit here and there ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  if it sounds like it 's almost always right and there 's not any big problem you send it to them .

dialogue type : s
F :  And , you know , then they 'll send us back what we w what what they send back to us ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and we 'll we 'll fix things up

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and some meetings will cost more time to fix up than others .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^cs.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  it 's probably in your paper that I haven't looked at lately ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Uh , an order of magnitude

dialogue type : qw
F :  notion of of how on a good meeting , how often uh , do you get segments that come in the middle of words and so forth ,

dialogue type : qw
F :  and uh in a bad meeting how often ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Well he 's saying , you know , that the the EDU meeting was a good good meeting ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh , and so so so it was almost it was almost always doing the right thing .

dialogue type : s
F :  So I wanted to get some sense of what what almost always meant .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then , uh in a bad meeting , or p some meetings where he said oh he 's had some problems , what does that mean ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  So I mean does one of the does it mean one percent and ten percent ?

dialogue type : qrr^rt
F :  Or does it mean five percent and fifty percent ?

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Or Maybe percentage isn't the right word ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  but you know how many how many per minute ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  You know .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  But I think that 's less of a problem .

dialogue type : s
F :  They 'll just listen .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's just wasted time .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  And th and that 's for a good meeting .

dialogue type : qo
F :  Now what about in a meeting that you said we 've you 've had some more trouble with ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So I So i Sometime , we might wanna go back and look at it more in terms of how many times is there a spurt that 's that 's uh , interrupted ?

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Something like that ?

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ng
F :  Yeah again I I think that that is probably less of a problem

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because if you 're if there 's If if a if a word is is split , then they might have to listen to it a few times to really understand that they can't quite get it .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Whereas if they listen to it and there 's don't hear any speech I think they 'd probably just listen to it once .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  So there 'd you 'd think there 'd be a a factor of three or four in in , uh , cost function ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  you know , between them or something .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  So so what you 're saying is that nearly always what happens when there 's a problem is that is that uh , there 's some uh , uh nonspeech that uh that is b interpreted as speech .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Well then , we really should just send the stuff .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because that doesn't do any harm .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  You know , if they they hear you know , a dog bark and they say what was the word ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^fe^j
F :  Ruff ruff !

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
F :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  But I think I th Again , I think that sort of that that would be good ,

dialogue type : s^na
F :  and what that 'll do is just cut the time a little further .

dialogue type : s
F :  But I think none of this is stuff that really needs somebody doing these these uh , uh , explicit markings .

dialogue type : s
F :  Yeah , cuz the other thing that was concerning me about it was that it seemed kind of specialized to the EDU meeting ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and and that then when you get a meeting like this or something ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and and you have a b a bunch of different dominant speakers

dialogue type : qw
F :  you know , how are you gonna handle it .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Whereas this sounds like a more general solution

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  I I would just use some samples ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  make sure you don't send them three hours of " bzzz " or something .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Great .

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  That 's life .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw
F :  What was the l what was the laptop sound ?

dialogue type : qy^e^rt
F :  I mean was it speech ,

dialogue type : qrr.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Great .

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Well , I mean ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  isn't there a category something like uh , " sounds for someone for whom there is no i close mike " ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.x
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  So .

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt^t^tc
F :  Shall we uh , do digits and get out of here ?

dialogue type : s^bk.%
F :  Yes ma '

dialogue type : qw^bu
F :  Which part ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df^na
F :  Cuz , I wouldn't don't think we would mind having that transcribed , if they did it .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co^t^tc
F :  Let 's do digits .

dialogue type : qh^cs^rt
F :  Uh , why don't we do it together ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  that 's that 's a nice fast way to do it .

dialogue type : s
F :  One , two , three ,

dialogue type : s^co
F :  go !

dialogue type : z
F :  I haven't been ,

dialogue type : z
F :  no .

dialogue type : z
F :  Uh , concentration .

dialogue type : z
F :  Yeah .
