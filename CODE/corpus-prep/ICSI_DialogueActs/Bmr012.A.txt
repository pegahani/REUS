dialogue type : z
A :  By the way , there was a bug .

dialogue type : z
A :  Yeah , i it wasn't using the proper

dialogue type : z
A :  basically it wasn't adapting anything .

dialogue type : z
A :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Oh , because when it estimates the transformer pro produces like a single matrix or something .

dialogue type : z
A :  Basically there were no counts

dialogue type : z
A :  Hello , hello .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I think

dialogue type : qy^cs
A :  Um may I make one suggestion ?

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Instead of age put date of uh year of birth

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because age will change , but The year of birth changes , you know , stays the same , usually .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  Well well I don't know .

dialogue type : s^t1
A :  Anyway .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : %
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa^t3
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %
A :  OK .

dialogue type : sj
A :  Well it was interesting ,

dialogue type : s
A :  suddenly the the overall error rate when we first ran it was like eighty percent

dialogue type : s
A :  but i looking at the first sentences looked much better than that

dialogue type : s
A :  and then suddenly it turned very bad

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  it was actually recognized

dialogue type : fh
A :  so

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  So so we have everything recognized but we scored only the first uh whatever , up to that time to

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : fg|%-
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  There are a fair number of errors that are , you know where got the plural S wrong or the inflection on the verb wrong .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well that 's those are the only we ones there are ,

dialogue type : %
A :  I mean

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I should I should say that the language model is not just Switchboard

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean there 's uh actually more data is from Broadcast News

dialogue type : s^e
A :  but with a little less weight

dialogue type : s^df.%-
A :  uh because

dialogue type : b
A :  mm - hmm ,

dialogue type : b
A :  right .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
A :  Um By the way just for fun we also ran ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  I mean our complete system starts by doing ge a gender detection

dialogue type : s
A :  so just for the heck of it I ran that

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um and it might be reassuring for everybody to know that it got all the genders right .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah so

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean clearly there are um with just a small amount of uh actual meeting transcriptions uh thrown into the language model you can probably do quite a bit better

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^arp
A :  Not that much the vocabulary actually

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  I think um well we have to see

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  We we talked about setting up the SRI recognizer here .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's you know if if there are more machines um uh here

dialogue type : s
A :  plus people can could run their own uh you know variants of of of the recognition runs

dialogue type : fh
A :  um

dialogue type : s
A :  certainly doable .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h
A :  U um

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^tc
A :  U uh actually I had a question about the downsampling ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um I don't know who , I mean how this was done

dialogue type : qy
A :  but is is there are there any um issues with downsampling

dialogue type : s
A :  because I know that the recognizer um that we use h can do it sort of on the fly

dialogue type : fh
A :  um

dialogue type : s
A :  so we wouldn't have to have it eh you know do it uh explicitly beforehand .

dialogue type : qy.%--
A :  And is there any um i

dialogue type : qy
A :  are there other d sev uh is there more than one way to do the downsampling where one might be better than another ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|%-
A :  So so the th

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  So so the other thing we should try is to just take the original wave forms ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I mean segment them but not downsample them .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  And and feed them to feed them to the SRI recognizer and see if if the SRI front - end does something .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
A :  Right and and it doesn't is no more work for um you know for us .

dialogue type : s^aap
A :  Well but they 're only twice as big

dialogue type : fh
A :  so

dialogue type : %-
A :  I mean it 's it 's just a

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
A :  Yeah I mean it would be uh you know it would probably take uh about um you know

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  minus the transfer time it would it would take uh you know ten minutes to try and and and

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  And and if for some reason we see that it works better then we might investigate why

dialogue type : fh|%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  You know a at some point someone might have optimized whatever filtering is done for the actual recognition um performance .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A :  So in other words

dialogue type : s^m
A :  right ,

dialogue type : fg
A :  so

dialogue type : s
A :  Mel cepstrum .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  That 's what I would assume but you never know ,

dialogue type : qy^d
A :  you know .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  Actually , no .

dialogue type : s^co
A :  Don't stop .

dialogue type : s^co
A :  Don't stop at that part because we 're actually using the entire conversation to estimate the speaker parameters ,

dialogue type : s^co.%-
A :  so shouldn't use you should s you know , get

dialogue type : b.%
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  They 're less animated .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  Like uh like you know Jerry Springer thing ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g.%-
A :  you know r

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy
A :  Do you have to hand it around

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  and if you have two pieces of

dialogue type : s
A :  Pretty soon .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
A :  Um Gotta go .
