D :  um , as as a starting point for the project .

D :  Um .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  In in my proposal , I I was thinking about starting from a set of , uh , phonological features , or a subset of them .

dialogue type : s
D :  Um , but that might not be necessarily a good idea according to , um , John .

dialogue type : s
D :  He said , uh , um , these these phonological features are are sort of figments of imagination also .

D :  Ye

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt

D : 

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Just to see where where I could start off from ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
D :  uh , you know ?

dialogue type : s
D :  A a a set of small features and continue to iterate and find , uh , a better set .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .
