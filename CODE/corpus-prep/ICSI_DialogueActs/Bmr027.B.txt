dialogue type : z
B :  Oh !

dialogue type : z
B :  Should we , uh , close the door , maybe ?

dialogue type : z
B :  So it 's

dialogue type : z
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
B :  Huh .

dialogue type : z
B :  Well , that 's a

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^t.%--
B :  So , just to repeat the thing bef that we said last week ,

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  it was there 's this suggestion of alternating weeks on more , uh , automatic speech recognition related or not ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Was that sort of the division ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  So which week are we in ?

dialogue type : s^arp
B :  I thought we had a thing about speech recognition last week too .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um . Yeah .

dialogue type : qw.%--
B :  Um . So , w what follows ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  At some point y you go around and get people to sign something ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df
B :  Yeah , but I 've forgotten .

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  And how long of an opportunity did you tell them ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  July fifteenth .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
B :  Oh , so they have a plenty of time ,

dialogue type : %-
B :  and y

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Given that it 's that long ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  Why was that date chosen ?

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
B :  You just felt you wanted to ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s
B :  No , the only th the only mention I recall about that was just that July fifteenth or so is when this meeting starts .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
B :  w

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  We probably should have talked about it ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B :  cuz i because if we wanna be able to give it to people July fifteenth ,

dialogue type : s^bu:s
B :  if somebody 's gonna come back and say " OK , I don't want this and this and this used " , uh , clearly we need some time to respond to that .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^df^no
B :  I just didn't remember ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  NSA .

dialogue type : s
B :  German , Dutch , Swiss and Spanish .

dialogue type : s
B :  I It was the network network services group .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  Otherwise known as the German , Dutch , and Spanish .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B :  I mean , if we 're going to have a policy on it ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  that we discuss the length of time that we want to give people ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  so that we have a uniform thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , tha that 's a month ,

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  which is fine .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I mean ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I I i I think that somebody might request something

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  even though we say that .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  But I think it 's good to at least start some place like that .

dialogue type : qw
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  if we say two weeks , or if we say a month ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs:s
B :  say that , you know , i a as um , " per the the the , uh , page you signed , you have the ability to look over this stuff " and so forth

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I would I would imagine some sort of generic thing that would say " because we , uh , will continually be making these things available to other researchers , uh , this can't be open - ended

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and so , uh , uh , please give us back your response within this am you know , within this amount of time " , whatever time we agree upon .

dialogue type : qy^rt^t1
B :  Did I ?

dialogue type : s
B :  No , I haven't yet .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s
B :  No , no . I 'm not saying that you should change anything .

dialogue type : s
B :  I I 'm what I 'm what I 'm I 'm trying to spark a discussion hopefully among people who have read it

dialogue type : s
B :  so that that you can you can , uh , decide on something .

dialogue type : s
B :  So I 'm not telling you what to decide .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I 'm just saying you should decide something ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , the one thing that I did read and that you just repeated to me was that you gave the specific date of July fifteenth .

dialogue type : s
B :  And you also just said that the reason you said that was because someone said it to you .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So what I 'm telling you is that what you should do is come up with a length of time that you guys think is enough

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and you should use that rather than this date that you just got from somewhere .

dialogue type : s^bd
B :  That 's all I 'm saying .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
B :  It well , it well , you 're right . Sometimes somebody will be away

dialogue type : s
B :  and , uh , you know , there 's , uh for any length of time that you uh , choose there is some person sometime who will not end up reading it .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's it 's , you know , just a certain risk to take .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , we we haven't experienced it before .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  If this is a purely administrative task , we can actually have administration do it .

dialogue type : s
B :  But the thing is that , you know , I I I think , without going through a whole expensive thing with our lawyers , from my previous conversations with them , my my sense very much is that we would want something on record as indicating that they actually were aware of this .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  Yeah . We never really talked about that .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  We certainly didn't talk , uh , about with them at all about , uh , the manner of them being made the , uh , uh , materials available .

dialogue type : s
B :  That was something that was sort of just within our implementation .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B :  Well .

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  Let me look at this again .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah . My Adam , my my view before was about the nature of what was of the presentation ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : qh.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : qh.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  That was the kind of dispute I was making before .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  and we have to decide how stringent we want to be in these things ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but they will always come back with saying that , um , you need to you want to have someth some paper trail or which includes electronic trail that they have , uh , in fact O K 'd it .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I think that if you f i if we send the email as you have

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and if there 's half the people , say , who don't respond at all by , you know , some period of time , we can just make a list of these people

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  you know , just give it to me

dialogue type : s
B :  and I 'll hand it to administrative staff or whatever ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs:s
B :  Is is this OK ? And would you please mail you know , mail Adam that it is , if i if it , you know , is or not . "

dialogue type : s
B :  So , you know , we can we can do that .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think the main thing is I mean , what lawyers do is they always look at worst cases .

dialogue type : s
B :  So they s so so Tha - that 's what they 're paid to do .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so , it is certainly possible that , uh , somebody 's server would be down or something

dialogue type : s
B :  and they wouldn't actually hear from us ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then they find this thing is in there

dialogue type : s
B :  and we 've already distributed it to someone .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , what it says in there , in fact , is that they will be given an opportunity to blah - blah - blah ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but if in fact if we sent them something or we thought we sent them something but they didn't actually receive it for some reason , um , then we haven't given them that .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I i i em email is enough .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bd
B :  I mean , I 'm not a lawyer ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but I 've been through these things a f things f like this a few times with lawyers now

dialogue type : s^df
B :  so I I I I 'm pretty comfortable with that .

dialogue type : s
B :  So again , hopefully , um , this shouldn't be quite as odious a problem either way ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , in any of the extremes we 've talked about

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because uh , we 're talking a pretty small number of people .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^df
B :  Yeah . Cuz it what it what it really does promise here is that we will ask their permission .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Um , and I think , you know , if you go into a room and close the door and and ask their permission and they 're not there , it doesn't seem that

dialogue type : s
B :  that 's the intent of , uh , meaning here .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , the way ICSI goes , people , uh , who , uh , were here ten years ago still have acc have forwards to other accounts and so on .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  So if we get to a boundary case like that then maybe I will call the attorney about it .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , you know , hopefully we won't need to .

dialogue type : s
B :  So we 'll we 'll see if we do or not .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah . I think very few people will

dialogue type : s
B :  and and and , you know , people people see long emails about things that they don't think is gonna be high priority , they typically , uh , don't don't read it , or half read it .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Cuz people are swamped .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Uh , or e well , maybe even additionally , uh , um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  " Even if you 've decided you have no changes you 'd like to make , if you could tell us that " .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , the other thing I 've learned from dealing with dealing with people sending in reviews and so forth , uh , is , um , if you say " you 've got three months to do this review " , um , people do it , you know , two and seven eighths months from now .

dialogue type : s
B :  If you say " you 've got three weeks to do this review " , they do do it , you know , two and seven eighths weeks from now they do the review .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um So ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^na
B :  There 's the responding part

dialogue type : qh.%--
B :  and there 's also what if ,

dialogue type : s^bd
B :  uh , I mean , I hope this doesn't happen ,

dialogue type : qh
B :  what if there are a bunch of deletions that have to get put in and changes ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Then we actually have to deal with that

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Are you del are you bleeping it by adding ?

dialogue type : %-
B :  I I

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I I understand ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  but is is it summing signals

dialogue type : qrr
B :  or do you delete the old one and put the new one in ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s^cs.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s^bd.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
B :  Encrypt it .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah . You could encrypt it ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , but we never also we 've also never done it .

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  So . And , uh and I 'm sorry responding without , uh , having much knowledge ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but the thing is , uh , I am , like , one of these people who gets a gazillion mails

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  and and stuff comes in as

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  So so the only thing we 're missing is is some way to respond to easily to say , uh , " OK , go ahead " or something .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
B :  Yeah . It 's converging .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  And we actually need a third thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's not that you 've looked at it ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it 's that you 've looked at it and and and agree with one of the possible actions .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : qy^bh^d
B :  Oh ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^2^bu^j^rt

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt^t^tc
B :  We heard anything from IBM ?

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  at all ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  But I think Yeah . Like you said , I mean , that 's that 's gonna be our standard proc

dialogue type : s
B :  that 's what the transcribers are gonna be spending most of their time doing , I would imagine ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^am

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I I was asking about this .

dialogue type : s
B :  I don't really quite understand this .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I think this actually didn't just come from her ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but this is what , uh , DARPA had asked for .

dialogue type : s
B :  Um , she 's referring to it as the an annual report for the fiscal year .

dialogue type : s
B :  But of course the fiscal year starts in October ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so I don't quite understand w w why we do an annual report that we 're writing in July .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , I think basically it it 's none of those .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's that the meeting is in July

dialogue type : s
B :  so they so DARPA just said do an annual report .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  So anyway , I 'll be putting together stuff .

dialogue type : s
B :  I 'll do it , uh , you know , as much as I can without bothering people ,

dialogue type : s
B :  just by looking at at papers and status reports .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  I mean , the status reports you do are very helpful .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , so I can grab stuff there .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs
B :  Yeah . If people could do it as soon as as you can , if you haven't done one si recently .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh . Uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but , you know , I 'm I 'm sure before it 's all done , I 'll end up bugging people for for more clarification about stuff .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um . But , um ,

dialogue type : s^bd^no
B :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  I guess I guess I know pretty much what people have been doing .

dialogue type : s
B :  We have these meetings and and there 's the status reports .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh . But , um . Um .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I 'll be talking to her late tomorrow afternoon ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and if something hasn't been in a status report and you think it 's important thing to mention on this kind of thing , uh , uh , just pop me a one - liner

dialogue type : s
B :  and and and I 'll I 'll have it in front of me for the phone conversation .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^t
B :  I guess , uh , you you 're still pecking away at the demos and all that , probably .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , that 's right .
