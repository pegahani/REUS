dialogue type : z
D :  Or , I like it , also , like this .

dialogue type : z
D :  So you see the

dialogue type : z
D :  So .

dialogue type : s^t1.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^rt^t.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^t
D :  about forms in general .

dialogue type : s
D :  Stuff .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^fa
D :  I uh probably should have printed out more of these .

dialogue type : s
D :  So one of the things that I 've been doing with the digits forms is I 've been adding more and more speaker specific information to them

dialogue type : s
D :  and it 's getting pretty crowded and you have to fill it out each time .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , what I thought was , it would be nice to have a single speaker form that you fill out once .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then , on the digits form you just have to put your name down and you can look it up from the speaker form .

dialogue type : s
D :  so , I had a first pass of it ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I spoke with Jane a bit about how to specify what language and education and that sort of stuff

dialogue type : s
D :  and so I have a first pass at it .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I was uh just wondering if people had any comments on information that should or shouldn't be on it .

dialogue type : s^fa
D :  And I only did one copy which was really stupid of me .

dialogue type : s
D :  um So I 'll just sort of say what it 's on and then I can hand it around .

dialogue type : s
D :  So the top of it is uh , Name , Sex Email or Other Contact Information .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I put the contact information just in case we have people with the same name , so that you can distinguish them ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and then also just to have a separate contact from the consent form .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then , uh , we talked a little bit about whether to do how we get at the background .

dialogue type : s
D :  And we could do profession , but it 's so uniform that we figured what was more important was actually the education level .

dialogue type : s
D :  um At least that would get at some idea of their background .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  So I have a And s

dialogue type : s^aa^m
D :  and relevant to status .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  So that what I have is uh

dialogue type : s
D :  So uh , I have uh , five things that you can circle ,

dialogue type : s
D :  Undergrad , Grad , Post - doc , Professor , and then Other , with a colon and a place where you can fill in if there 's some Other .

dialogue type : s
D :  So I think the problem with that is that there 's not a necessarily easy equivalent for our visitors , who are not used to the US education levels .

dialogue type : s
D :  and may need some help to translate what that means .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , the problem with that is um , I think the same as the problem of profession .

dialogue type : sj^df
D :  That it it will be there will be a tendency all for everyone to put down " speech researcher " or or something at that granularity .

dialogue type : s
D :  So I don't think there 's a problem asking the education level , I th At least I don't feel like there is .

dialogue type : qo
D :  um I think the only question is whether the what categories should there be .

dialogue type : s
D :  Less .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , one of the one of the criteria I had for designing this form , is that I didn't want a separate instruction sheet .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so we 'll get to that in a moment when we talk about language also .

dialogue type : s
D :  Is I did not want to have to , you know come down and quiz each person and have a uh social dynamics expert being the one who 's filling out the answers .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  I want it to be self - evaluating .

dialogue type : s
D :  You can give it to them and they can understand what you 're asking .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  That 's a separate question .

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  So , we 'll We 'll get to that in a moment .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I know .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , this particular form is speaker is dependent only on the speaker ,

dialogue type : s
D :  not on the meeting .

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s^df
D :  But then that 's interfering with the meeting .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , what I like about this information is you give it to them once , and they fill it out once ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and and then you have that information .

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  Not at all .

dialogue type : sj^df
D :  I mean , the fact that one person 's an undergrad and the other 's a full professor is interesting .

dialogue type : qh.%-
D :  So , the question is how much of this information um , can y

dialogue type : s^aa^fe
D :  Well , absolutely !

dialogue type : s
D :  But but you want to have that information .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : qh
D :  So , if you don't have that information , how are you gonna do anything ?

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  I mean , so what would you suggest ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Undergrad , Grad , Post - doc , Professor , Other

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  oh , that 's right ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  you know I was saying " Professor " .

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , when I said " Professor " , I guess what I was thinking in my mind was more " PHD but not Post - doc " .

dialogue type : qy^cs^d^rt
D :  and Or maybe Post - doc change " Post - doc " to " PHD " ?

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because I think PHD and Professor are d are distinct

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
D :  aren't they ?

dialogue type : s^j
D :  Someone who has a PHD .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  So , maybe Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD and Other ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
D :  If i Instead of instead of instead of Professor or instead of Post - doc ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD , Professor , Other ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  Well , the whole reason that I 'm doing it this way is is uh my experience so far has been the exact reverse .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  I guess we could have another type of form for less frequent .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Well I think that if if we 're planning to do that , then we should probably have another set of forms .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  You know , a single form that 's the consent form and the speaker information form and not have them do digits .

dialogue type : s^t
D :  This is a topic I want to bring up after I get through this .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , that that that 's another form that I want to discuss . um , with the digits forms .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Yeah , I 'm I have that as a topic , also .

dialogue type : s^co^t
D :  So , let 's finish with the speaker form speaker form and then we 'll get over o get over to that one .

dialogue type : s^t
D :  So , Education Level , Undergrad , Grad , Post - PHD , Professor , Other .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
D :  OK ?

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  um and then I put " Optional " with a big " Optional " in parentheses , Age .

dialogue type : s
D :  Because I think a lot of people are sensitive to it and won't want to write it down .

dialogue type : s
D :  So I don't want to make them feel like they have to .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df^nd:s
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs^ng
D :  Well , I think that just having on the form saying Optional , Age , again means I don't have to be sitting here and explaining the form every time we do this .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  And having a little instruction sheet and say " If you 're in this age range do this , and if you 're in this rage do that . "

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah , right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ng^rt
D :  Well , I think maybe that 's because no one here is sensitive about their age .

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  But , I would rather let them leave it blank than lie .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  So that 's why I want to put That 's why I want to put s " Optional , Age " ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  so that if they don't want to put it , they leave it blank .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  But if you put " Optional " , won't they just leave it blank rather than lie ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^ng^rt
D :  You don't think they 'd just leave it blank if it says has a big " Optional " right next to it ?

dialogue type : sj^df
D :  It It I think it 's better to put " Optional " .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  I mean , that 's why I put it there , s

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  but it seems like maybe you disagree .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well I didn't mark anything else as specifically optional ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  Um , and then the next are two sections

dialogue type : s
D :  One indented separately .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , one 's for native English speakers and one for non - native English speakers .

dialogue type : s
D :  OK , so for the native English speaker it asks for a variety of English with three circle boxes

dialogue type : s
D :  American , British , Indian and Other , for write - in .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yep . Jane and I discussed this , and it was it was again the same problem

dialogue type : s
D :  that it 's gonna be a self - evaluation anyway ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  and so I don't want to have to be standing over the person and asking them " Well , do you mean that your native an l an language was British when you were born , and then it changed to American when you were two , and then it changed to " and so on .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , th there 's room on the form to put al a a line of instruction , but I 'm just not sure what it re should really be .

dialogue type : s
D :  So the the for the non - na for the native English speakers we have Variety of English and Region .

dialogue type : s
D :  And that 's it .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then we have another form later down which is um , list other language influences .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^na
D :  Right , neither would I .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  If you 're American English it would be region of the US .

dialogue type : s
D :  That that so that 's why I didn't have circle forms .

dialogue type : s
D :  Because it would be different depending on what your language is .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  It - I think it would be however you would identify your own .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , as I said I don't really see a way of doing a circle fill in , because there would be there would have to be one for American English , one for British English , one for you know , one for each type .

dialogue type : s
D :  But but that would mean I would have to do generate a different form for circles , if you 're American English or British English or Indian English .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  Yeah , I just don't know what to do about the other varieties of English .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , that 's why I wanted to just leave it something that you could write it down .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , there could be a circle one .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^cs:qw
D :  So , you could say " What region did you grow up in from these years ? "

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  What language was spoken in the home ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Depends of who you ask , what the age range is .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  So so th

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , the way it 's phrased right now , it 's clearly asking about language .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  And so , what it 's trying to get at is what you think you speak .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  Now , I think that the point is well taken that sometimes people are wrong about what they think they speak .

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  But , other than having a trained linguist interview them and ask these very specific questions , I don't see a way around it .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because as you said , what you 're gonna have to stay say is " Well , list the languages that your parents spoke when you were in home and how good they were at it and how long they spoke it ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and now list the ones in preschool

dialogue type : s
D :  and now list the ones in first grade

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  and now list the ones your friends speak "

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  So I want to try to keep the complexity so someone can fill out this form at the beginning of a meeting without taking f uh forty - five minutes .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  So I think that adding the the TIMIT categories is a good idea ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because that 's very easy for a person to fill out .

dialogue type : qo^df^rt
D :  But I think we still have this problem of is it gonna be a self - evaluation ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
D :  or are we gonna ask them " what was it when you were four years old , or what was it when you were six years old , or what wher " w

dialogue type : qw
D :  What 's the best way of phrasing the question ?

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  Or adapta or adaptation .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
D :  Then maybe we shouldn't just shouldn't ask .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Well , maybe for the native English speakers we shouldn't even ask the region if it 's that unreliable .

dialogue type : s^tc
D :  The other thing also is that I 'm asking for the variety of English , and I did just put American , British , Indian and other .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , I didn't put Canadian , Australian , and all the other varieties .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  e But do you think those three are OK ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  So that for the Eng - native English speakers , we 'll do variety of English , regions from the TIMIT labels , and another field .

dialogue type : %-
D :  And then

dialogue type : s^t1
D :  I thought this was be fast .

dialogue type : s^t3
D :  Air conditioning .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
D :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Right , the way the way the form reads now , I think it 's pretty clear that 's what we 're asking cuz it says " Native English speakers , Variety of English , American , British , Indian , Other , Region " .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then we 'll have Southern English , you know , whatever whatever the TIMIT categories are .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  So I think i if you look at this fr

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|sj
D :  Right , so I it seems to me that if you read this form , i w it 's pretty obvious that it 's a subcategory of the language that you think you speak ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  not where you live .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , I don't say anything about where you live on the form .

dialogue type : s
D :  So it 's just in the section talking about language .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:s^co
D :  And then uh , as Jane said , the last question is " List other language influences , bilingual dialects , et cetera . "

dialogue type : s
D :  And that 's just and open - ended place for them to do .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  And then the bottom of the form is for not for them to fill out , but for us to fill out , for um the aliases and database speaker database that the person is in , since we 'll eventually anonymize

dialogue type : s
D :  and this will be a form a place for us to connect the two .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then the meetings that they attended ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because there 'll be one form for each person .

dialogue type : fh
D :  OK . So .

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  Yeah , I guess I 'll fiddle around yet again with the language stuff .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , there 's another area which is non - native English speakers which asks for Native language , Region , and Variety of English .

dialogue type : s
D :  And that 's it .

dialogue type : s^m
D :  Proficiency .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  That 's a good idea .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , do you think that 's That 's also because they know that it 's a re important for them to be good at it .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  So , don't don't you think they overrate rather than underrate ?

dialogue type : %-
D :  So , but

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  no , I think proficiency is actually a good thing to have on this sort of form .

dialogue type : qh
D :  The the question are what are what would the categories be ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^arp^no
D :  Yeah , I 'm I don't know .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
D :  Being totally monolingual , I 'm not the right person to ask , to talk about this

dialogue type : s
D :  but it just seems to me that that doesn't the length of time doesn't really get at what we 're asking .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  It seems to be that asking about the proficiency , even if it 's self - rated , is what we wanna know .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  With that form .

dialogue type : qr.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Uh , the other form is a modified digits form .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  uh and it 's pretty sim this one 's pretty simple ,

dialogue type : s
D :  it 's it 's very much what like the digits forms in front of us , except it doesn't ha ask for sex or native language .

dialogue type : s
D :  Um , so it 's Name , Email , Time , Date , Seat , Session , Mike number , Channel , Mike type .

dialogue type : s
D :  Uh , in case people have the same name .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Have the same name .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Yeah , I 'm particularly sensitive to this cuz a good friend of mine in S in Seattle was named Scott Smith and there were fourteen of them in at Boeing .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So We could drop email .

dialogue type : s^bd
D :  I mean that 's not a big deal ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Well , the other way I was thinking about it was assigning them an ID

dialogue type : s^df
D :  but I hate it when people do that to me ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  when they say , here 's you ID ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  don't forget it .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , I I wanted just something that would give us a hint of who the person is if the name field isn't readable or it 's a duplicate .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
D :  Your mother 's maiden name mother 's maiden name

dialogue type : s^cs^j
D :  social security number ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So , although the email email will change , I think that 's a good way of doing it .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  We 'll be able to backtrack from email .

dialogue type : s^tc
D :  Um , and then the other thing I was thinking about and it probably wouldn't be on the digits form ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  but it it is something that some form about the individual meeting .

dialogue type : s
D :  Now , the problem I have with that is I don't know who would be filling it out .

dialogue type : s
D :  Just to pick up an arbitrary an example .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Right .

dialogue type : qw
D :  So th so the sorts of questions I had were one Who 's gonna fill it out , and who 's gonna take responsibility for filling it out in each meeting ,

dialogue type : qy
D :  I mean , will we re will we require it .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw
D :  And that was my other question , which is um what sort of information do we want to record ?

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , so I think pairwise relationships are pretty easy .

dialogue type : s
D :  You know , source , destination , relation .

dialogue type : qy
D :  Are there other sorts of things that might we might want to record ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  I think that fits in well with the whole meeting map mapping meetings concept is that 's another way of looking at looking at it .

dialogue type : qy
D :  So , are there anything other than pairwise ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh yeah , OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yes , shirt certainly .

dialogue type : s
D :  I 've been thi I it seems to be that there is We could attach more structure if we wanted to .

dialogue type : s
D :  Especially because a lot of these relationships are pairwise power relationships .

dialogue type : s
D :  Um , just as an example , it would be , " Source , Adam Janin " , " Destination , Morgan " , " Relationship , Advisor " .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  that are relevant .

dialogue type : s^aa.%
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg|s^bd^na.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa^m
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bd
D :  Well , it 's just cuz it 's my turn .

dialogue type : s^bd
D :  Well , the D T Ds mean we can do whatever however we want it .

dialogue type : s^df^nd
D :  But what I what I was thinking uh the reason that I didn't want to make it completely open - ended is that it does seems like there is some structure which is common .

dialogue type : s
D :  Especially with these pairwise ones , where you can describe them and pairwise .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  And you might want a tool that used that information .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Sure , absolutely .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  So you 're football league was a good one .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So the ones I 've been thinking of are all sort of uh , power , responsibility .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
D :  I guess husband - wife is yet another one .

dialogue type : s^fe
D :  Ach !

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Some more .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Nope .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , so what I have right now is all pairwise ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so that 's probably not sufficient .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah , maybe not .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yep . OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , I think that in a lot of the meetings people won't be filling this out anyway .

dialogue type : s
D :  So really what I want to have is a place that if a researcher wants that information , they can add it .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  So it We can regenerate a lot of this information .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  But Even if we can't , generate it , I think it 's alright to have some of the sections in your database blank , that this information was not collected for this meeting .

dialogue type : s
D :  And there 's just not gonna be a way around that .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's just gonna happen

dialogue type : s
D :  like the N S A meeting , the networks meeting .

dialogue type : sj
D :  I don't think they 're gonna want to fill out that information .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
D :  OK , enough on forms .

dialogue type : s
D :  They haven't received them yet ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I did get a response from them saying " Yes we 're still alive ,

dialogue type : s
D :  we haven't done anything yet . " basically .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  So so , they 've transferred the responsibility to someone else .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I can't remember his name McCoond ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^m^rt
D :  McCoond ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Something like that ,

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  And so he sent me email and said he 's gonna be starting to work on it ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I haven't received anything else .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  So tomorrow I 'll send a email and just ask if he received it ,

dialogue type : s
D :  he should be getting it today .

dialogue type : s^bsc
D :  Actually he should have gotten it yesterday .

dialogue type : s
D :  But . Give him a day .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  And And And did is this from the mixed signal ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  OK , so there is some normalization already , in that they 've been volume equalized uh over the entire signal .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^df^ng
D :  Well , but the mixed signal already has a normalization in it .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , I think it 'll be worse ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  right ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs
D : 

dialogue type : s^e
D :  hamming window .

dialogue type : b
D :  Huh .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  And he has on his graph something like forty percent .

dialogue type : s
D :  It looked like fifty percent or more are point two seconds or longer overlap

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's li I think the last page .

dialogue type : s^bsc
D :  Nope , not the last page .

dialogue type : qw^t1
D :  Where was it ?

dialogue type : s
D :  It was one of the tables .
