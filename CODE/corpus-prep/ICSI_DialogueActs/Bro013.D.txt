dialogue type : s
D :  No , I w I begin to play with Matlab and to found some parameter robust for voiced - unvoiced decision .

dialogue type : s
D :  But only to play .

dialogue type : s
D :  And we they we found that maybe w is a classical parameter , the sq the variance between the um FFT of the signal and the small spectrum of time we after the um mel filter bank .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , well , is more or less robust .

dialogue type : s
D :  Is good for clean speech .

dialogue type : s
D :  Is quite good for noisy speech .

dialogue type : s
D :  but um we must to have bigger statistic with TIMIT ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  and is not ready yet to use on ,

dialogue type : s^no
D :  well , I don't know .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  I have here .

dialogue type : s
D :  I have here for one signal , for one frame .

dialogue type : s
D :  The the mix of the two , noise and unnoise , and the signal is this .

dialogue type : s
D :  Clean , and this noise .

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  the mixed , the big signal is for clean .

dialogue type : h|s
D :  Uh this is uh this axis is nnn , " frame " .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : h|s
D :  Uh , this is uh energy , log - energy of the spectrum .

dialogue type : %--
D :  Of the

dialogue type : s
D :  this is the variance ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  the difference between the spectrum of the signal and FFT of each frame of the signal

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and this mouth spectrum of time after the f may fit for the two ,

dialogue type : s
D :  this big , to here , they are to signal .

dialogue type : s
D :  This is for clean and this is for noise .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
D :  I I think that I have d another graph ,

dialogue type : s^no
D :  but I 'm not sure .

dialogue type : s
D :  The lower is noise and the height is clean .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's height .

dialogue type : s
D :  Oh . I must to have .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Pity , but I don't have two different

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Yeah , it is the height is voiced portion .

dialogue type : s
D :  And this is the noise portion .

dialogue type : s
D :  And this is more or less like this .

dialogue type : s
D :  But I meant to have see @ @ two two the picture .

dialogue type : s
D :  This is , for example , for one frame .

dialogue type : s
D :  the the spectrum of the signal .

dialogue type : s
D :  And this is the small version of the spectrum after ML mel filter bank .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  And this is

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  This is not the different .

dialogue type : s
D :  This is trying to obtain with LPC model the spectrum

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  but using Matlab without going factor and s

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Not pre - emphasis .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Nothing .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I think that this is good .

dialogue type : s
D :  This is quite similar .

dialogue type : s
D :  this is this is another frame .

dialogue type : s
D :  ho how I obtained the envelope , this envelope , with the mel filter bank .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  Yeah because when did noise clear in these section is clear

dialogue type : s
D :  if s @ @ val value is indicative that is a voice frame and it 's low values

dialogue type : s
D :  you have read up and you have a paper , the paper that you s give me yesterday .

dialogue type : s
D :  they say that yesterday they are some problem

dialogue type : x
D : 

dialogue type : s^m
D :  Is another problem .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah like this .

dialogue type : s
D :  Of kind like this .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .
