dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Uh , so uh , so I c I definitely have to leave at three - thirty today

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Yeah , they 're they 're having birthday cake and such

dialogue type : s
B :  and so I can't miss that .

dialogue type : s|s^aa
B :  I 'm a May birthday , yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  this is one it 's one hour of of of speech ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  And it took you a few hours to to do it .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  He said that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hunh .

dialogue type : qy.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qw
B :  How - how many how many beeps are there , and how many do we were they d were were off ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : qy.%-
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah , and it was a hundred - ish .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  uh , uh , excuse me .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  If you get one off , it t everything is off cuz of the alignment

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  Uh , and this is all in one file that 's continuous .

dialogue type : qh^cs
B :  So why don't you make it multiple files ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because then if they have one off , then

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , it seems now , if you just ha make one mistake then everything is off .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^rt|s.%--
B :  Yeah , just say , " OK , is " ten minutes is "

dialogue type : s^bd
B :  I mean , maybe there 's other things to do that are more clever ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but this just seemed to be the sort of the obvious thing

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because , again , if you make one mistake , then everything after that mistake is off .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Oh . Kind of low variance ,

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
B :  wouldn't that be ?

dialogue type : s
B :  You sort of might end up with some infinities there ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : qy^rt^t3
B :  Can I see that ?

dialogue type : qw^t3
B :  Where 's the case ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So is this a

dialogue type : qy^rt^t3
B :  seven or something ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qw^t3
B :  What is it ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  M - one - hundred .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Or you could you could have ascending tones , or something .

dialogue type : h|%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  No , I just thi I don't know . If you have a hundred or something just just sort of move them up i mu up a a half tone or something for for each one ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bh^rt
B :  Oh was it ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^cc^j
B :  See , I should listen .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^am^ba
B :  That might work too .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B :  Yeah , I was just thinking that actually temporally just , uh , uh , uh , an increasing tones so that

dialogue type : s
B :  they would really have a sense of whether they were going , you know , forward or backward

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
B :  Well , it 's a thought .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Yeah , maybe .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's probably better ,

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  S scratch my other idea .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Great idea ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  No , two is probably better than what I was suggesting ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because what I was suggesting , in order to make it through a reasonable range for the whole thing , you 'd have to have the the tonal differences between the two kind of small ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and actually you want them large .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw
B :  I mean , what 's going wrong on the other end ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  What are they doing ?

dialogue type : qw.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  OK ,

dialogue type : %-
B :  s

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  that 's your indicator there , and twenty - three that somebody happens to say in a meeting .

dialogue type : s^bu^ng
B :  But they might miss that ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I think having a beep too is good .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  W we 're saying " beep " . Yeah for instance .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  But it sounds like a k a a a short conversation with Brian might be might be helpful to get a sense of what 's going on .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  You 're saying i it 's it 's about an hour meeting ,

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qw^br
B :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , I was just wondering what the average length thing was .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh

dialogue type : fg|%-
B :  So , right . So i

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Right , but my point was , you know , if It 's a big difference to me if there 's a thousand or there 's a hundred .

dialogue type : s
B :  If there 's a thousand , then that means that this is only happening three times out of a thousand .

dialogue type : s
B :  Which means , you know , even just splitting it up into a few files would probably take You know , nearly all the time ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  W if it 's a hundred , then you know , that 's not the issue ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but if it 's a hundred , then , the average length of each one is pretty pretty long

dialogue type : s
B :  and so having a little thing at the front of it is no big deal .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , that 's why I was curious .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
B :  Yeah , you 're still talking a forced al

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , with the beep models , is what 's really you 'd have really g it would be really good though .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Uh uh , again , especially if there 's hundred many hundreds or thousands I still think it would it would cut the incidence of this a lot if it was possible to break it into a couple files .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
B :  Yeah . Cuz it , you know , it 's r r

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I mean , you 've already broken them into chunks ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so if you have if you have a th if you have a thousand chunks then make ten things of a hundred , or or you know .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then it will be , you know , this Eve - every now and then there 'll be a a beep missing .

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  Which one is these ?

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
B :  You know , there are so many things about this that are non - uniform that I think having having some modicum of uniformity is a good thing ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  For instance , jus just the fact that people sit in different positions , different times ,

dialogue type : s^df^e
B :  the exactly where they put it with respect to their mouth is different each time .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , I think we we 're we 're getting rid of major differences

dialogue type : s
B :  like we 're not using the lapel anymore , an and so forth .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But

dialogue type : s
B :  the other stuff is just gonna some variability we 're gonna have to accept .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : fg|s^ba
B :  Yeah , see I I happen to like the old one better .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  And some people do ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  You know . I mean , here 's another argument against worrying too much about uniformity .

dialogue type : s
B :  We have something like forty - five hours of data collected .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , uh , we 're also gonna be integrating in this corpus stuff that 's that 's being done at UW , uh , with entirely different microphones .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  I think that 's sort of the big deal .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  Uh , another wireless system .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  You mean , another transmitter ?

dialogue type : qrr.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Oh , to get r to get rid of the wired things .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes , absolutely .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Uh , because cuz we 've had With the exception of forgetting to change the batteries from time to time , uh , we 've really had no tr no trouble with this at all ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And and the wired stuff is just gonna continue to degrade as , you know ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Whoever will pay ,

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  Do you mean the kind that hang from the ear , sort of thing ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Yeah , but I don't know that one .

dialogue type : qw
B :  So what 's that mean ?

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Oh they they have little headsets ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Oh you 've you 've got one .

dialogue type : qw
B :  So where where does how do you wear that ?

dialogue type : qw^e.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bk^m
B : 

dialogue type : x
B :  Huh .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah , that I 've seen .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  Why would it be cool ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^fa
B :  Oh , I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  You 're talking about that as a possible thing to plug into the Sonys .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  No ?

dialogue type : s^aap|s^aa
B :  Well , some people will , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  Well , I mean , another s

dialogue type : s
B :  An - another side to that is that , um , in principle , uh , if it all comes together , supposedly we 're gonna get two um , IRAM boards .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Uh , little later on in the year .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so , we 're gonna wanna be thinking in terms of some wireless connection to it .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so we have , you know , some kind of little something ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and , uh , we have a wireless connection , this board , that 's doing the computation for the f the , uh the recognition .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so , you know , we wanna be able to show off to somebody ,

dialogue type : s
B :  you know , we have a base station somewhere ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and you 're wandering around , uh , hands free ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s
B :  No , no , what I 'm saying is that we 're gonna have to put together some kind of a little superstructure , d some sort of demo box that it that doesn't do a whole lot ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but it somehow connects to uh , remotely to this IRAM board

dialogue type : s
B :  which will be doing the real computation .

dialogue type : s
B :  In other words , we 're we 're not gonna attempt to build , uh , it do the real work of building a portable device that 's little , that is doing all the computation we wanna do for the recognition and the far - field mike , uh , compensation and all that stuff .

dialogue type : s
B :  So we 're gonna do all that on this powerful board ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and , uh , have some wireless connection to it .

dialogue type : qh
B :  And then the question is what is what does it look like ,

dialogue type : qh
B :  does it look like something that you you hold like this ,

dialogue type : qh
B :  or do we make a big deal out of it that you hold it arm at arm 's length th so that you can see some display ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  or , uh ,

dialogue type : qh.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bd^no
B :  You know . I don't know .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , it th these are all possibilities .

dialogue type : s^bk|qy.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Who Well , we 're s talking about a fairly limited group ,

dialogue type : qy
B :  are are is it a small enough group that they would could just have accounts ?

dialogue type : qy^e
B :  Does that solve anything ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^nd.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : qw

dialogue type : b
