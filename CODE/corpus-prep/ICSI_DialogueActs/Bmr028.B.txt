dialogue type : s^na
B :  I think that 's correct .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  So do you have to pad that out ? Uh , so that it looks like it 's an eight kilohertz sampled thing ?

dialogue type : qrr.%-
B :  Or ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Seems like you should be able to spawn that off into a background process ,

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  because not everything is displayed in that tree at once .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  Seems like you wanna ass

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Did you actually look through your transcripts ?

dialogue type : qrr^d
B :  Or you just approved them all .

dialogue type : s
B :  I just approved all mine .

dialogue type : s
B :  I didn't look at them .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's a compliment to you .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  He said it 's hard to find things you say wrong .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
B :  Find everything that should be bleeped .

dialogue type : s
B :  I haven't done anything .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  I was away for a couple of days .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  What does the two - second threshold mean ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Ah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I wouldn't think that the language model would continue across two seconds .

dialogue type : s
B :  Wel - He had a problem .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  H he did , and then it didn't work ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and

dialogue type : s
B :  I didn't hear anything after that .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Yeah . He he didn't say he hasn't said anything to me about it .

dialogue type : fg|%-
B : 

dialogue type : fg|%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  They 're stored on Popcorn .

dialogue type : b
B : 

dialogue type : h|s
B :  Um , I 'm rebuilding the net that we 're gonna use for the tandem stuff .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so what I 'm doing is , um , putting in the stream reader into the Quicknet libraries for the SRI feature files .

dialogue type : s
B :  An - Which is the right way to do it .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , when we did our first experiments and I was , uh , creating SRI feature files from the ICSI front - end , I just had perl scripts , you know , and hacked a bunch of stuff together

dialogue type : s
B :  just to get it going .

dialogue type : s
B :  But the r the right way to do it is to integrate it in with the ICSI tools .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And so ,

dialogue type : s
B :  that 's what I 'm doing now .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so once I get that done , then I 'll generate the P - files I need .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Cuz we already have the feature files in the SRI format .

dialogue type : s
B :  So what I need to do is , make it so that the the Quicknet stuff can read those .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's both .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  There 's a there 's an input stream and an output stream .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  So , then it 's t uh , tandem experiments after that ?

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  We don't have too many . We just have that just have a few Linux machin

dialogue type : s
B :  Whatever the language model says .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  D Do you think the battery ran out ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B :  Or ?
