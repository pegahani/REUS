dialogue type : z
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
E :  Right .

dialogue type : z
E :  Uh , right .

dialogue type : z
E :  Uh .

dialogue type : z
E :  Right . Yeah , I I I avoided that as long as I could for you guys ,

dialogue type : z
E : 

dialogue type : z
E :  Right .

dialogue type : z
E :  e

dialogue type : z
E : 

dialogue type : z
E :  OK . We can do this .

dialogue type : z
E :  Everybody 's got different digits ,

dialogue type : z
E :  right ?

dialogue type : z
E :  No .

dialogue type : z
E :  e

dialogue type : z
E :  yeah , the

dialogue type : z
E :  Well , they they have s they have the close talking microphones for each of us ,

dialogue type : z
E : 

dialogue type : z
E :  yeah , there 's separate channels .

dialogue type : z
E :  So when I say

dialogue type : z
E :  OK .

dialogue type : z
E :  Right .

dialogue type : z
E :  No .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , you you had s you said there were two things that you might wanna do .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Yeah , no I s I s I see this has got the castle in it , and stuff like that .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^am
E :  Uh , yeah , I think so .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
E :  No , this is the twenty - first .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Whatever .

dialogue type : s
E :  You certainly can .

dialogue type : s^no.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right ,

dialogue type : fg
E :  um .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , the time to mention it , if you mention it , is when you talk about mirror neurons ,

dialogue type : s
E :  then you should talk about the more recent stuff , about the kicking

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : b
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  and that the plan is to see to what extent the you 'll get the same phenomena with stories about this ,

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  and that we 're planning to do this ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  which , we are .

dialogue type : s
E :  So that 's one thing .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s
E :  Depends . I mean , there is a , um , whole language learning story ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
E :  OK ?

dialogue type : %--
E :  which ,

dialogue type : %--
E :  uh , actually , i i

dialogue type : s
E :  even on your five - layer slide , you you 've got an old one that that leaves that off .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  OK , so , so anyway , I I agree that 's not central .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
E :  What you might wanna do is ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  um ,

dialogue type : s^bd
E :  and may not ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
E :  but you might wanna this is rip off a bunch of the slides on the

dialogue type : %--
E :  anal

dialogue type : s
E :  there the there we 've got various i generations of slides that show language analysis , and matching to the underlying image schemas ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  and ,

dialogue type : fh|qh.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  that ho that whole th

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  The quals w the the the quals slides would be fine .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  You could get it out of there , or some

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Yeah , it 's different ,

dialogue type : s
E :  this is the , uh , DNA building , or someth the double helix building .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  The yeah it was it turns out that if if you have multiple billions of dollars , y you can do all sorts of weird things ,

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^na
E :  Roughly , yeah .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Including cr cross - bridges ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  and

dialogue type : s
E :  You d you really now I I spent the last time I was there I spent maybe two hours hearing this story

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , no , no , y i there 's infinite money .

dialogue type : s^f
E :  See

dialogue type : s
E :  you th you th you then fill it with researchers .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  So , yeah , I think that 's that 's a good point ,

dialogue type : s.x
E :  th th that the date , the , uh ,

dialogue type : s
E :  a lot of the this is interacting with , uh , people in Italy

dialogue type : s
E :  but also definitely the people in Leipzig

dialogue type : fh
E :  and

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  the b the combination of the biology and the Leipzig connection might be interesting to these guys ,

dialogue type : b
E :  yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
E :  Anyway ! Enough of that ,

dialogue type : s^co^t
E :  let 's talk about your thesis proposal .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : h
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No , no , no .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  So I did note

dialogue type : s
E :  i i it looks like the , uh , metaphor didn't get in yet .

dialogue type : s^bd
E :  Well , s reference is one thing ,

dialogue type : qy.%--
E : 

dialogue type : qy.%-
E :  Oh , did you put in something about ,

dialogue type : %--
E :  uh , the individual ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  we 'd talked about putting in something about people had ,

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh yeah , OK .

dialogue type : s^ba|s
E :  Good . I see where you have it .

dialogue type : s
E :  So the top of the second of pa page two you have a sentence .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
E :  But , what I meant is , I think even before you give this , to Wahlster , uh , you should ,

dialogue type : s
E :  unless you put it in the text ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and I don't think it 's there yet ,

dialogue type : s
E :  about we talked about is the , um , scalability that you get by , um , combining the constructions with the general construal mechanism .

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  Is that in there ?

dialogue type : s^bk|qw
E :  Uh , OK , so where where is it ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  cuz I 'll have to take a look .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Uh , OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  No , it it it s says it

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  but it doesn't say it doesn't it d it d

dialogue type : s^aa|s^e
E :  yeah , it doesn't give the punch line .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Cuz let me tell the gang what I think the punch line is ,

dialogue type : s
E :  because it 's actually important ,

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  which is , that , the constructions , that , uh , Nancy and Keith and friends are doing , uh , are , in a way , quite general

dialogue type : s
E :  but cover only base cases .

dialogue type : s
E :  And to make them apply to metaphorical cases and metonymic cases and all those things , requires this additional mechanism , of construal .

dialogue type : s
E :  And the punch line is , he claimed , that if you do this right , you can get essentially orthogonality ,

dialogue type : s
E :  that if you introduce a new construction at at the base level , it should com uh , interact with all the metonymies and metaphors

dialogue type : s
E :  so that all of the projections of it also should work .

dialogue type : s
E :  And , similarly , if you introduce a new metaphor , it should then uh , compose with all of the constructions .

dialogue type : s
E :  And it to the extent that that 's true then then it 's a big win over anything that exists .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
E :  So that , you know , for example , uh , in the metaphor case , that you have a kind of direct idea of a source , path , and goal

dialogue type : s
E :  and any metaphorical one and abstract goals and all that sort of stuff you can do the same grammar .

dialogue type : s
E :  And it is the same grammar .

dialogue type : fh
E :  But , um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  the way the construction 's written it requires that the object of the preposition for example be a container .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , " trouble " isn't a container ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but it gets constr construed as a c container .

dialogue type : s
E :  Et cetera .

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  So that 's that 's where this , um ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  So 's it 's it it 's a very big deal , i i in this framework ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  and the thesis proposal as it stands doesn't ,

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  um , I don't think , say that as clearly as it could .

dialogue type : s^aap
E :  Oh , nothing is context - free ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but there are basic cases .

dialogue type : s
E :  That is , um , there are physical containers ,

dialogue type : s
E :  there are physical paths ,

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s^f
E :  you know ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  et cetera .

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  Oh , it doesn't mean that they 're unambiguous .

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , a cafe can be construed as a container , or it can be construed you know as as a obstacle ,

dialogue type : s
E :  or as some physical object .

dialogue type : s
E :  So there are multiple construals .

dialogue type : s
E :  And in fact that 's part of what has to be done .

dialogue type : s
E :  This is why there 's this interaction between the analysis and the construal .

dialogue type : s
E :  The b the the double arrow .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
E :  So , uh , yeah , I mean , it doesn't magically make ambiguity go away .

dialogue type : s
E :  But it does say that , uh , if you walked into the cafe and broke your nose , then you are construing the cafe as an obstacle .

dialogue type : s
E :  And if that 's not consistent with other things , then you 've gotta reject that reading .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  But " run into " does .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df
E :  Yeah , no , but " run into " does .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  Because you will find " run into , "

dialogue type : fh
E :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^2.%--
E :  well , or " into the cafe " for that m

dialogue type : s^f
E : 

dialogue type : s:s
E :  " His car ran into the cafe . "

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , you can " run into " in that sense too .

dialogue type : fh
E :  But , uh ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  But Like , " run into an old friend " , it probably needs its own construction .

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , uh , you know , George would have I 'm sure some exa complicated ex reason why it really was an instance of something else

dialogue type : s
E :  and maybe it is ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  but , um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  there are idioms

dialogue type : s
E :  and my guess is that 's one of them ,

dialogue type : s^bd^no^rt
E :  but , um I don't know .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Uh .

dialogue type : fg|%-
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
E :  oh yeah , mo for sure ,

dialogue type : s^r
E :  motivated ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but then you can't parse on motivated .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
E :  OK , so , um ,

dialogue type : qo
E :  anything else you want to ask us about

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  We could look at a particular thing and give you feedback on it .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Right right r

dialogue type : s:s
E :  OK , f let 's let 's suppose you use " in " and " on " .

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , that 's what you started with .

dialogue type : s
E :  So " in the bus " and " on the bus , "

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  um , that 's actually a little tricky in English

dialogue type : s
E :  because to some extent they 're synonyms .

dialogue type : s^f
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|qw
E :  OK , what did he say .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : fg|s^na
E :  Yeah , I I believe all that ,

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Right . So so that that may or may not be what you what you want to do .

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean you could do something much simpler

dialogue type : s^cs^e
E :  like " under the bus , " or something ,

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  Well , unless he was repairing it or something ,

dialogue type : s^bd
E :  but yeah .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Uh , but OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^2^aap
E :  Or being out of something as , uh as well .

dialogue type : s
E :  So " running out of it " definitely has a process aspect to it .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So ,

dialogue type : s^bd^df
E :  b that 's OK ,

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  I mean b but the difference

dialogue type : qy.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  Yeah , so so nob so no one has in in of the ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
E :  professional linguists ,

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  there was this whole thesis on " out of " .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , there I thought or there was a paper on it .

dialogue type : qw^br
E :  Huh ?

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  There was a

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , it may be just " out " .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  I think there was " over "

dialogue type : s
E :  but there was also a paper on " out " .

dialogue type : s
E :  Or something .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
E :  Yeah , and all that sort of stuff .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  OK . But anyway . We 're not gonna do that between now and next week .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b.%
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^ng
E :  No no no , but not for your talk .

dialogue type : %--
E :  I 'm - we 're worrying about the th the thes

dialogue type : s
E :  it 's just for one guy .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%--
E :  No , no . The question is d do you wanna do you wanna construe do you wanna constr - strue

dialogue type : %--
E :  r

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
E :  Exactly . It 's because do you wanna c do you want to view the bakery as a p a place that that i for example , if y

dialogue type : s
E :  Well th well , that 's one .

dialogue type : s
E :  You want to buy something .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  But the other is ,

dialogue type : s
E :  uh , yo you might have smelled a smell and are just curious about whether there 'd be a bakery in the neighborhood ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  or ,

dialogue type : %--
E :  um , pfff

dialogue type : s
E :  you know , you wonder how people here make their living ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and there 're all sorts of reasons why you might be asking about the existence of a bakery

dialogue type : s
E :  that doesn't mean , " I want to buy some baked goods . "

dialogue type : fh
E :  But um ,

dialogue type : s^ba^df
E :  those are interesting examples

dialogue type : s
E :  but it 's not clear that they 're mainly construal examples .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  There 's all sorts of stuff going on .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So

dialogue type : s^co
E :  let 's so let 's think about this from the point of view of construal .

dialogue type : s^co.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  So the metonymy thing is probably the easiest

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s
E :  N no not that one ,

dialogue type : s
E :  that 's that 's a the sort of background .

dialogue type : s
E :  This is the t uh , page five .

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No .

dialogue type : s
E :  Just beyond that .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^j
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's not for sale .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Uh . So

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
E :  OK . Can we think of a nice metaphorical use of " where " in the tourist 's domain ?

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^cs:s
E :  you you can sometimes use " where " f for " when "

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  in the sense of , you know ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  um ,

dialogue type : qh.%--
E :  where wh where where was , um ,

dialogue type : qh
E :  " where was Heidelberg , um , in the Thirty Years ' War ? "

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Or something .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  You know , or some such thing .

dialogue type : b
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah . Essentially , yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  But anyway th so there are there are cases like that .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um ,

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa
E :  Yeah . There certainly is that , yeah .

dialogue type : s:qw
E :  You know , " Where could I learn its opening hours , " or something .

dialogue type : s
E :  But that 's not metaphorical .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  So we 're thinking about , um ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
E :  or we could also think about ,

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : qo
E :  How about " I 'm in a hurry " ?

dialogue type : s
E :  It i But it 's a state and the the issue is , is that it may be just a usage ,

dialogue type : s
E :  you know , that it 's not particularly metaphorical ,

dialogue type : s^bd^no
E :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah . Yeah , right .

dialogue type : s^fe
E :  Ah !

dialogue type : qw.%-
E :  How about

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
E :  I I I you know , " I 'm in I 'm in a state of exhaustion " ?

dialogue type : s
E :  or something like that ,

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  which a tourist w

dialogue type : qw^br
E :  Huh ?

dialogue type : s^na:s
E :  A st uh , well , you can certainly say , um , you know , " I 'm in overload . "

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Tu - stur tourists will often say that .

dialogue type : qy^am^rt
E :  Oh , you can do that ?

dialogue type : qh
E :  Really ?

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk|%--
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bk^m
E :  Right . As an institution ,

dialogue type : b
E :  yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
E :  Ah !

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  So that 's that 's that 's a that 's a reasonable point ,

dialogue type : s
E :  that it in this domain you 're gonna get less metaphor and more metonymy .

dialogue type : s
E :  And polysemy , and stuff like that .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk^t3
E :  Alright . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^t3
E :  s See you .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs.%--

dialogue type : s^am^cs

dialogue type : qh
E :  was this alleyway open .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs^rt^tc
