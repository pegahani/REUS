dialogue type : z
D :  Channel three . Alright .

dialogue type : h|s^nd
D :  N um , not not not much is new .

dialogue type : s
D :  So when I talked about what I 'm planning to do last time , I said I was , um , going to use Avendano 's method of , um , using a transformation , um , to map from long analysis frames which are used for removing reverberation to short analysis frames for feature calculation .

dialogue type : s
D :  He has a trick for doing that involving viewing the DFT as a matrix .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  but , uh , um , I decided not to do that after all

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because I I realized to use it I 'd need to have these short analysis frames get plugged directly into the feature computation somehow

dialogue type : s^df
D :  and right now I think our feature computation is set to up to , um , take , um , audio as input , in general .

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  So I decided that I I 'll do the reverberation removal on the long analysis windows

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  and then just re - synthesize audio

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  and then send that .

dialogue type : h
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s^arp
D :  or even if I 'm using our system , I was thinking it might be easier to just re - synthesize the audio ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because then I could just feacalc as is

dialogue type : s^df
D :  and I wouldn't have to change the code .

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Right . That 's true .

dialogue type : fg
D :  But e u

dialogue type : s^2
D :  From the re - synthesis ?

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  O - OK .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know anything about re - synthesis .

dialogue type : qw
D :  Uh , how likely do you think that is ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  That Yeah , e That 's it , that 's it .

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , OK .
