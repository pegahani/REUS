dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^cs
C :  Have Have we thought about having a conference call to include him in more of in more of the meeting ?

dialogue type : s^bd^no
C :  I I mean , I don't know ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see . OK .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^ba
C :  No . It 's not good .

dialogue type : s^ba^r
C :  That 's not good .

dialogue type : s
C :  This is this that one 's better .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  If you have a strong fe if you have a strong preference , you could use this .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  It 's just we we think it has some spikes .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , uh , we we didn't use that one .

dialogue type : s
C :  But you could if you want .

dialogue type : s^no.%
C :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
C :  And Andre - Andreas , your your microphone 's a little bit low .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
C :  So if you see the picture

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
C :  and then you have to scr

dialogue type : s^t3.%
C :  That looks good .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Well .

dialogue type : fg|s^ba
C :  Yeah . This would be OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  We we we think that this has spikes on it ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so it 's not as good acoustically ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  And there 's a screw that you can tighten .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Good .

dialogue type : s
C :  That looks good .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^fa.%
C :  Sorry .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  I have to ask you something ,

dialogue type : s^cs^df
C :  is i does it have to be Waves ? Because if we could benefit from what you did , incorporate that into the present transcripts , that would help .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And then , um , the other thing is , I believe that I did hand

dialogue type : s
C :  So . One of these transcripts was gone over by a transcriber

dialogue type : s
C :  and then I hand - marked it myself so that we do have , uh , the beginning and ending of individual utterances .

dialogue type : s
C :  Um , I didn't do it word level ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  So I so for for one of the N S A groups .

dialogue type : s
C :  And also I went back to the original one that I first transcribed and and did it w uh , w uh , utterance by utterance for that particular one .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  if that 's a sufficient unit , I think that you do have hand - marking for that .

dialogue type : s
C :  But it 'd be wonderful to be able to benefit from your Waves stuff .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  I used it in Transcriber

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , I th I 'm thinking just ch e e incorporating it into the representation .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  if you have start points , if you have , like , time tags ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  which is what I assume .

dialogue type : qy.%--
C :  Isn't that what what you ?

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C :  If it ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  So you would know this more than I would .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  It seems like she if she 's g if she 's moving time marks around ,

dialogue type : s
C :  since our representation in Transcriber uses time marks , it seems like there should be some way of of using that benefitting from that .

dialogue type : s
C :  We have two .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Oh , good .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Good !

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Uh - huh . Yeah , exactly . Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
C :  Yes , I did .

dialogue type : s
C :  And furthermore , I found that there were a certain number where not not a lot , but several times I actually moved an utterance from Adam 's channel to Dan 's or from Dan 's to Adam 's .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So there was some speaker identif

dialogue type : s
C :  And the reason was because I transcribed that at a point before uh , before we had the multiple audio available

dialogue type : %--
C :  f

dialogue type : s
C :  so I couldn't switch between the audio .

dialogue type : s
C :  I I transcribed it off of the mixed channel entirely ,

dialogue type : s
C :  which meant in overlaps , I was at a at a terrific disadvantage .

dialogue type : s
C :  In addition it was before the channelized , uh , possibility was there .

dialogue type : s
C :  And finally I did it using the speakers of my , um of you know , off the CPU on my on my machine

dialogue type : s^df
C :  cuz I didn't have a headphone .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , I I mean , i in retrospect it would 've been good to ha have got I should 've gotten a headphone .

dialogue type : s
C :  But in any case , um , thi this is this was transcribed in a in a , uh , less optimal way than than the ones that came after it ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and I was able to you know , an and this meant that there were some speaker identif identifications

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  which were changes .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Fixed that .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^fe
C :  Uh - oh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^ft
C :  Thank you for mentioning .

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , no , tha that That I think went away a couple of versions ago ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but it 's good to know .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C : 

dialogue type : s^bd^df
C :  not for long utterances ,

dialogue type : s^bd^e
C :  but jus just a couple of places ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and embedde embedded in overlaps .

dialogue type : s
C :  The other thing that was w interesting to me was that I picked up a lot of , um , backchannels which were hidden in the mixed signal ,

dialogue type : s
C :  which , you know , I mean , you c not not too surprising .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I I hadn't thought about this ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but I thou I wanted to raise this when you were uh , with respect to also a strategy which might help with the alignments potentially ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  When I was looking at these backchannels , they were turning up usually very often in w well , I won't say " usually " but anyway , very often , I picked them up in a channel w which was the person who had asked a question .

dialogue type : s:qy
C :  S so , like , someone says " an and have you done the so - and - so ? "

dialogue type : s
C :  And then there would be backchannels ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but it would be the person who asked the question .

dialogue type : s
C :  Other people weren't really doing much backchannelling .

dialogue type : s:s
C :  And , you know , sometimes you have the Yeah , uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bd
C :  I mean , i it wouldn't be perfect ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  but but it does seem more natural to give a backchannel when when you 're somehow involved in the topic ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and the most natural way is for you to have initiated the topic by asking a question .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s
C :  Exactly my point .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  An - and so this is the expectation thing that uh , uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  There you go .

dialogue type : s
C :  There you go .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Well , that 's right .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C :  Well , an

dialogue type : s
C :  And what you say is the is the re uh , o other side of this ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which is that , you know , so th there are lots of channels where you don't have these backchannels , w when a question has been asked

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  So that 's good news , really .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Good .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , see , I know S Sue wrote about spurts of development .

dialogue type : s^ba^rt
C :  But , in any case , I think it 's a good term ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  And ma maybe maybe Chafe did .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Chafe speaks about intonation units .

dialogue type : s
C :  But maybe he speaks about spurts as well

dialogue type : s^no
C :  and I just don't know .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  Yeah , go ahead .

dialogue type : b
C :  Great .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  That 's wonderful .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : s
C :  What 's interesting is it 's exactly what , um , i in discussing with , um , Sue about this ,

dialogue type : s
C :  um , she , um , i i i indicated that that you know , that 's very important for overlap analysis .

dialogue type : s
C :  And that 's another thing she said .

dialogue type : s
C :  This is This is Bever 's Bever 's effect ,

dialogue type : s
C :  when where In psy ps psycho - linguistics you have these experiments where people have perceptual biases a as to what they hear ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Superb .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  I think we can ha

dialogue type : %
C :  Nah .

dialogue type : s
C :  And good ones ,

dialogue type : s^r
C :  good ones ,

dialogue type : s
C :  which sometimes means a little extra time .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm looking forward to seeing your representation .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'd like to see that .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Great .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  It 's , uh , two thousand eleven twenty - one one thousand .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Great .

dialogue type : s
C :  I sent email when I finished the that one .

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  That was sort of son

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
C :  Yeah , that 's right . That 's right .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  That 's much simpler .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  Yeah . Not that NSA .

dialogue type : b
C :  Interesting .

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  I guess it does w

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  It also raises the possibility of , um , using that kind of representation I mean , I don't know , this 'd be something we 'd wanna check , but maybe using that representation for data entry

dialogue type : s^cs^e
C :  and then displaying it on the channelized , uh , representation ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  cuz it I think that the I mean , my my preference in terms of , like , looking at the data is to see it in this kind of musical score format .

dialogue type : s
C :  And also , s you know , Sue 's preference as well .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  but , I mean , this if this is a better interface for making these kinds of , uh , you know , lo clos local changes , then that 'd be fine , too .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't I have no idea .

dialogue type : s
C :  I think this is something that would need to be checked .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^fe
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk.%
C :  Ah .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Nice .

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^e^rt
C :  I mean , at the same time ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  Oh , you haven't !

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Oh , and the groupings are important ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so yo you 're supposed to pause between the groupings .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Yeah . That 'd be good .

dialogue type : s^cs^j

dialogue type : s^bk
