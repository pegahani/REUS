dialogue type : s^cs
G :  I c I could talk about the meeting .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na^rt
G :  Well , you you , um , already know about the meeting that 's coming up

dialogue type : s
G :  and I don't know if if this is appropriate for this .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  I mean , maybe maybe it 's something we should handle outside of the meeting .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa.%
G :  Sure . Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^t
G :  I had thought under my topic that I would mention

dialogue type : s
G :  the , uh , four items that I I , uh , put out for being on the agenda f on that meeting ,

dialogue type : s
G :  which includes like the pre - segmentation and the and the developments in multitrans .

dialogue type : s^m^na
G :  Yeah , under the NIST thing .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  And that 's true .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  I mean , I we did discuss this .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk^m
G :  a couple times ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  ugh

dialogue type : s
G :  well , I mean there 's it 's the double thing .

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's the equipment and also how it 's worn .

dialogue type : s
G :  And he 's always they always they just rave about how wonderful Adam 's Adam 's channel is .

dialogue type : %-
G :  And then ,

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
G :  Yeah , but I mean it 's not just that , it 's also you know you

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's also like n no breathing ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  You know , it 's like it 's it 's um ,

dialogue type : s
G :  it 's really it makes a big difference from the transcribers ' point of view

dialogue type : s
G :  and also from the research s point of view .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Good .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h
G :  OK , so , um , uh ,

dialogue type : s
G :  Jonathan Fiscus is coming on the second of February

dialogue type : s
G :  and I 've spoken with , uh , u u a lot of people here ,

dialogue type : s
G :  not everyone .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um , and , um ,

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  he expressed an interest in seeing the room

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  and in , um , seeing a demonstration of the modified multitrans ,

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  which I 'll mention in a second ,

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  and also , um , he was interested in the pre - segmentation

dialogue type : s
G :  and then he 's also interested in the transcription conventions .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
G :  And , um So , um , it seems to me in terms of like ,

dialogue type : fh|%--
G :  um , i i it wou

dialogue type : fh
G :  You know , OK .

dialogue type : s
G :  So the room , it 's things like the audio and c and audi audio and acoustic acoustic properties of the room

dialogue type : s
G :  and how it how the recordings are done ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and that kind of thing .

dialogue type : s
G :  And , um . OK , in terms of the multi - trans , well that that 's being modified by Dave Gelbart to , uh , handle multi - channel recording .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bd|s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Yeah , and it 's t and it looks really great .

dialogue type : s
G :  He he has a prototype .

dialogue type : s
G :  I I , uh , @ @ didn't didn't see it , uh , yesterday

dialogue type : s
G :  but I 'm going to see it today .

dialogue type : s
G :  And , uh , that 's that will enable us to do nice um , tight time marking of the beginning and ending of overlapping segments .

dialogue type : s
G :  At present it 's not possible with limitations of of the , uh , original design of the software .

dialogue type : fh
G :  And um .

dialogue type : s^bd^no
G :  So , I don't know .

dialogue type : s
G :  In terms of , like , pre - segmentation , that that continues to be , um , a terrific asset to the to the transcribers .

dialogue type : s
G :  Do you I know that you 're al also supplementing it further .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Do you want to mention something about that c Thilo ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
G :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk.%
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  This is good . Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  Excellent , so this 'd be like w e providing also speaker ID potentially .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Wonderful .

dialogue type : b
G :  Wonderful .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : qy^rt^t
G :  Can I ask one thing ?

dialogue type : fh
G :  Uh , so , um ,

dialogue type : s
G :  Jonathan Fiscus expressed an interest in , uh , microphone arrays .

dialogue type : fh|qy.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean b And I also want to say , his he can't stay all day .

dialogue type : s
G :  He needs to uh , leave for uh , from here to make a two forty - five flight

dialogue type : s^e
G :  from from Oakland .

dialogue type : s
G :  So it makes the scheduling a little bit tight

dialogue type : qr^cs
G :  but do you think that , um that , uh , i John Canny should be involved in this somehow or not .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I have no idea .

dialogue type : s^nd
G :  It 's premature .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Fine .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Good .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
G :  Well one thing I I mean , I don't know .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , I know that having an array of I mean , I would imagine it would be more expensive to have a an array of microphones .

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt
G :  But couldn't you kind of approximate the natural sis situation by just shutting off uh , channels when you 're later on ?

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt
G :  I mean , it seems like if the microphones don't effect each other then couldn't you just , you know , record them with an array and then just not use all the data ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Fine .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Yeah , w although I m I I have to u u mention the human subjects problems , that i increase with video .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  I it it occurred to me , has Don signed a human subject 's form ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
G :  A permission form ?

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  You were here at a meeting before .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Did you sign a form ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s
G :  You don't you don't have to leave for it .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^f
G :  you know .

dialogue type : %-
G :  o

dialogue type : s^bk^m
G :  Transcriptions , OK .

dialogue type : s
G :  Um , I thought about there are maybe three aspects of this .

dialogue type : s
G :  So first of all , um , I 've got eight transcribers .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  Uh , seven of them are linguists .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  One of them is a graduate student in psychology .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  Um , Each I gave each of them , uh , their own data set .

dialogue type : s
G :  Two of them have already finished the data sets .

dialogue type : s
G :  And the meetings run , you know , let 's say an hour . Sometimes as man much as an hour and a half .

dialogue type : s
G :  Oh , it 's what I mean is one meeting .

dialogue type : s
G :  Each each person got their own meeting .

dialogue type : s
G :  I didn't want to have any conflicts of , you know , of of when to stop transcribing this one

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So I wanted to keep it clear whose data were whose ,

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  And , uh , meetings , you know , I think that they 're they go as long as a almost two hours in some in some cases .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  Uh , right now all eight of them have differe uh , uh , additional data sets . That means potentially as many as ten might be finished by the end of the month .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Hope so .

dialogue type : s
G :  But the pre - segmentation really helps a huge amount .

dialogue type : s
G :  And , uh , also Dan Ellis 's innovation of the , uh the multi - channel to here really helped a r a lot in terms of clearing clearing up h hearings that involve overlaps .

dialogue type : fh
G :  But , um ,

dialogue type : s
G :  just out of curiosity I asked one of them how long it was taking her , one of these two who has already finished her data set .

dialogue type : s
G :  She said it takes about , uh , sixty minutes transcription for every five minutes of real time .

dialogue type : s
G :  So it 's about twelve to one ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which is what we were thinking .

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's well in the range .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
G :  OK . Uh , these still , when they 're finished , um , that means that they 're finished with their pass through . They still need to be edited and all

dialogue type : s
G :  but But it 's word level , speaker change , the things that were mentioned .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
G :  OK , now I wanted to mention the , um , teleconference I had with , uh , Jonathan Fiscus .

dialogue type : s
G :  We spoke for an hour and a half

dialogue type : s
G :  and , um , had an awful lot of things in common .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  He , um , um , he in indicated to me that they 've that he 's been ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I 'm not quite sure the connection ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but spending a lot of time with the ATLAS system .

dialogue type : s
G :  And I guess that I mean , I I need to read up on that .

dialogue type : s
G :  And there 's a web site that has lots of papers .

dialogue type : s
G :  But it looks to me like that 's the name that has developed for the system that Bird and Liberman developed for the annotated graphs approach .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  So what he wants me to do

dialogue type : s
G :  and what we what we will do and uh , is to provide them with the u already transcribed meeting

dialogue type : s
G :  for him to be able to experiment with in this ATLAS System .

dialogue type : s
G :  And they do have some sort of software ,

dialogue type : s
G :  at least that 's my impression , related to ATLAS

dialogue type : s
G :  and that he wants to experiment with taking our data

dialogue type : s
G :  and putting them in that format , and see how that works out .

dialogue type : s
G :  I I I explained to him in in detail the , uh , conventions that we 're using here in this in this word level transcript .

dialogue type : fh
G :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
G :  you know , I I explained , you know , the reasons that that we were not coding more elaborately

dialogue type : s
G :  and and the focus on reliability .

dialogue type : s
G :  He expressed a lot of interest in reliability .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  It 's like he 's he 's really up on these things .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s:qw
G :  Um , independently he asked , " well what about reliability ? "

dialogue type : s
G :  So , he 's interested in the consistency of the encoding and that sort of thing .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^bd^df
G :  Uh , well Adam 's read more in more detail than I have on this .

dialogue type : s
G :  I need to acquaint myself more with it .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  Uh , whenever you have coding categories , um , and you 're dealing with uh , a taxonomy , then you can have branches that that have alternative , uh , choices that you could use for each each of them .

dialogue type : s
G :  And it just ends up looking like a graphical representation .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
G :  Including LDC .

dialogue type : s^am
G :  I think so .

dialogue type : s
G :  Mm - hmm . Then there 's their web site that has lots of papers .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  And I looked through them

dialogue type : s^e
G :  and they mainly had to do with this , um , this , uh , tree structure , uh , annotated tree diagram thing .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  So , um , um and , you know , in terms of like the conventions that I 'm a that I 've adopted , it there there 's no conflict at all .

dialogue type : s
G :  And he was , you know , very interested .

dialogue type : s:qw
G :  And , " oh , and how 'd you handle this ? "

dialogue type : s:s
G :  And I said , " well , you know , this way "

dialogue type : s
G :  and And and we had a really nice conversation .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  Um , OK , now I also wanted to say in a different a different direction is , Brian Kingsbury .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  So , um , I corresponded briefly with him .

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  He still has an account here .

dialogue type : s
G :  I told him he could SSH on and use multi - trans , and have a look at the already done , uh , transcription . And he and he did .

dialogue type : s
G :  And what he said was that , um , what they 'll be providing is will not be as fine grained in terms of the time information .

dialogue type : fh|s^cc
G :  And , um , that 's , uh You know , I need to get back to him and and , uh , you know , explore that a little bit more and see what they 'll be giving us in specific ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  but I just haven't had time yet .

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
G :  Sorry , what ?

dialogue type : b
G :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^ng
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I don't think that they 're court reporters .

dialogue type : s
G :  I don't think they have the special keyboards and that and that type of training .

dialogue type : s
G :  I I get the sense they 're more secretarial .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
G :  Up to now it 's been monologues , uh , as far my understood .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  And and what they 're doing is

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G :  uh , cuz , you know , I mean , we wanted to have it so that they were in familiar f terms with what they wanted to do .

dialogue type : s
G :  He downloaded from the CD onto audio tapes .

dialogue type : s
G :  And apparently he did it one channel per audio tape .

dialogue type : s
G :  So each of these people is transcribing from one channel .

dialogue type : s
G :  And then what he 's going to do is check it ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  a before they go be beyond the first one .

dialogue type : s
G :  Check it and , you know , adjust it , and all that .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I I don't know .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^na
G :  I think it would be difficult to do it that way . I really

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  Well I th I think so .

dialogue type : s
G :  Yeah , I I would think that it would be kind of hard to come out with Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  I agree .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah , we have .

dialogue type : s^ng
G :  Well , except I can say that my transcribers use the mixed signal mostly

dialogue type : s^e
G :  unless there 's a huge disparity in terms of the volume on on the mix .

dialogue type : s
G :  In which case , you know , they they wouldn't be able to catch anything except the prominent channel ,

dialogue type : s
G :  then they 'll switch between .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : fg|s^aa
G :  Well , OK .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s^no
G :  Well , I have to ask him .

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  And that 's that 's my email to him . That needs to be forthcoming .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  But but the , uh I did want to say that it 's hard to follow one channel of a conversation even if you know the people ,

dialogue type : s
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So , you know , one of these people was was transcribing the , uh , networks group talk

dialogue type : s:s
G :  and she said , " I don't really know what a lot of these abbreviations are , "

dialogue type : s.%--:s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  It 's very a real benefit having Brian involved

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because of his knowledge of what the how the data need to be used and so what 's useful to have in the format .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Good .

dialogue type : b
G :  Oh good .

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  Now wasn't I thought that one of the proposals was that IBM was going to do an initial forced alignment ,

dialogue type : s^e.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^cc
G :  Yeah . I I need to to write to him .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  I just you know , it 's like I got over - taxed with the timing .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
G :  A good size .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Good .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Well , I I was thinking it would be fun to to uh , uh , if if you wouldn't mind , to give us a pre - segmentation .

dialogue type : s
G :  Uh , maybe you have one already of that first m of the meeting that uh , the first transcribed meeting ,

dialogue type : s
G :  the one that I transcribed .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Do you have a could you generate a pre - segmentation ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Oh , darn .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Of course , of course , of course .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Excellent , good .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
G :  Yeah , Liz and I spoke d w at some length on Tuesday

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  and and I and I was planning to do just a a preliminary look over of the two that are finished and then give them to you .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  the the modification to multi - trans which will allow fine grained encoding of overlaps .

dialogue type : s
G :  Uh , then it would be very these people would be very good to shift over to finer grain encoding of overlaps .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  So if right now you have two overlapping segments in the same time

dialogue type : s
G :  bin , well with with the improvement in the database in in the , uh , sorry , in the interface , it 'd be possible to , um , you know , just do a click and drag thing , and get the uh , the specific place of each of those , the time tag associated with the beginning and end of of each segment .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  Also if you 're dealing with consonants that would be easier than vowels ,

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
G :  wouldn't it ?

dialogue type : s^e
G :  I mean , I would think that that , uh , being able to code that there 's a a fricative extending from here to here would be a lot easier than classifying precisely which vowel that was .

dialogue type : s
G :  I think vowels vowels are I think harder .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Mm - hmm , OK .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  Yeah , I 'm sure .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Uh , yeah , I I know .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  That 's nice .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Excellent .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  It 's a nice balance .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  That would be really nice to offer those things with that wide range .

dialogue type : s^ba^r
G :  Really nice .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Cool .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Good .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  Also it does seem like it takes us way out of the demographic .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , it seems like we we had this idea before of having like linguistics students brought down for free lunches

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  and that 's a nice idea .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah . That 's right .

dialogue type : s
G :  Of course some of that can be li done lexically .

dialogue type : s
G :  And I also they are doing disfluency tagging to some degree already .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  They 'd be really good .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  They 're they 're very they 're very consistent .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
G :  Uh , I wanted to whi while we 're Uh , so , to return just briefly to this question of more meeting data ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  um I have two questions .

dialogue type : s
G :  One of them is , um , Jerry Feldman 's group ,

dialogue type : qy.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I know that they recorded one meeting .

dialogue type : qy
G :  Are they willing ?

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
G :  That 's important .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
G :  Joe Sokol ?

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I see that Lila has a luncheon meeting in here periodically .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
G :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  of course there is this problem though , that if we give them the chance to excise later we e might end up with like five minutes out of a f of m one hour

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  of Yes . Really .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well there was this K P F A

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^t
G :  And I had one other one other aspect of this

dialogue type : s
G :  which is , um , uh , uh , Jonathan Fiscus expressed primar uh y a major interest in having meetings which were all English speakers .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Now he wasn't trying to shape us in terms of what we gather

dialogue type : s
G :  but that 's what he wanted me to show him .

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  So I 'm giving him our , um our initial meeting

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because he asked for all English .

dialogue type : s^df^e
G :  And I think we don't have a lot of all English meetings right now .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  That 's what I mean , yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  He doesn't care .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  No . Eh , well , British is OK .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Sure , sure , sure .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  Yeah . Different varieties of English .

dialogue type : s
G :  Native speaking . Native speaking English .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yes .

dialogue type : qh
G :  Oh , really .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  That 's funny .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Alright .

dialogue type : s
G :  And so that would make sense .

dialogue type : s
G :  I didn't have the context of that .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  All America , OK .

dialogue type : s
G :  I think that the Feldman 's meetings tend to be more that way ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  aren't they ?

dialogue type : s^e.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^ba.%
G :  It 's be fun .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
G :  We could get Julia Child .

dialogue type : s^bk^j
G :  I know .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  Pre - processing .

dialogue type : s
G :  You know , this does like seem like it would relate to some of what Jose 's been working on as well ,

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I was t I was trying to remember , you have this interface where you i you ha you showed us one time on your laptop

dialogue type : s
G :  that you you had different visual displays as speech and nonspeech events .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .
