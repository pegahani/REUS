dialogue type : z
B :  We 're , I mean we We didn't have a house before .

dialogue type : z
B :  Oh , yeah !

dialogue type : z
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%
B :  The new consent form .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^fe.%
B :  Exactly !

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Ah but , yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think what 's really interesting though , it is before d saying " yes , meetings have a lot of overlaps " is to actually find out how many more we have than two - party .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  Cuz in two - party conversations , like Switchboard , there 's an awful lot too if you just look at backchannels , if you consider those overlaps ?

dialogue type : s
B :  it 's also ver it 's huge .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's just that people haven't been looking at that because they 've been doing single - channel processing for speech recognition .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , the question is , you know , how many more overlaps do you have of , say the two - person type , by adding more people . to a meeting ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and it may be a lot more but i it may it may not be .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm ?

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  Well , it 's not really " nice " .

dialogue type : s
B :  It depends what you 're doing .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So if you were actually having ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  depends what you 're doing ,

dialogue type : s
B :  if Right now we 're do we have individual mikes on the people in this meeting .

dialogue type : s
B :  So the question is , you know " are there really more overlaps happening than there would be in a two - person party " .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I I agree that it 's an issue here but it 's also an issue for Switchboard

dialogue type : s
B :  and if you think of meetings being recorded over the telephone , which I think , you know , this whole point of studying meetings isn't just to have people in a room but to also have meetings over different phone lines .

dialogue type : s
B :  Maybe far field mike people wouldn't be interested in that but all the dialogue issues still apply ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so if each of us was calling and having a meeting that way you kn you know like a conference call .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , just the question is , y you know , in Switchboard you would think that 's the simplest case of a meeting of more than one person ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and I 'm wondering how much more overlap of the types that that Jane described happen with more people present .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it may be that having three people is very different from having two people or it may not be .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^arp
B :  Not you , me .

dialogue type : fg
B :  But uh but but

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  There there 's

dialogue type : s^na.%--
B :  actually to tell you the truth , the reason why it 's hard to measure is because of

dialogue type : s
B :  so , from the point of view of studying dialogue , I mean , which Dan Jurafsky and Andreas and I had some projects on , you want to know the sequence of turns .

dialogue type : s
B :  So what happens is if you 're talking and I have a backchannel in the middle of your turn , and then you keep going what it looks like in a dialogue model is your turn and then my backchannel ,

dialogue type : s
B :  even though my backchannel occurred completely inside your turn .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , for things like language modeling or dialogue modeling it 's We know that that 's wrong in real time .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , because of the acoustic segmentations that were done and the fact that some of the acoustic data in Switchboard were missing , people couldn't study it ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but that doesn't mean in the real world that people don't talk that way .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
B :  So , it 's um

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Well , we 've als

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  We 're looking at it here .

dialogue type : b
B :  Um .

dialogue type : fg|s^df
B :  Yeah , all I meant is that if you 're asking the question from the point of view of what 's different about a meeting , studying meetings of , say , more than two people versus what kinds of questions you could ask with a two - person meeting .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's important to distinguish that , you know , this project is getting a lot of overlap but other projects were too , but we just couldn't study them .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And and so uh

dialogue type : h|s
B :  Well , there is a high rate ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  It 's but I don't know how high , in fact

dialogue type : sj
B :  that would be interesting to know .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , I I don't di I agree with that .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's also true of Switchboard .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So it 's just , um

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  All I 'm saying is that from the

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  No , I I agree with that .

dialogue type : s
B :  I 'm just saying that it may the reason you get overlaps may or may not be due to sort of the number of people in the meeting .

dialogue type : s
B :  And that 's all .

dialogue type : s
B :  And and it would actually be interesting to find out

dialogue type : s
B :  because some of the data say Switchboard , which isn't exactly the same kind of context ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean these are two people who don't know each other and so forth ,

dialogue type : s
B :  But we should still be able to somehow say what what is the added contra contribution to sort of overlap time of each additional person , or something like that .

dialogue type : b
B :  But yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  If you can see them , actually .

dialogue type : sj
B :  It 's interesting ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so if you watch people are going like Right right , like this here ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but That may not be the case if you couldn't see them .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's a lot of head - nodding , in this

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : sj^fa|qw^rt
B :  Sorry , what were you saying ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I think there 's a lot of the kind that Jose was talking about , where I mean , this is called " precision timing " in conversation analysis , where they come in overlapping , but at a point where the information is mostly complete .

dialogue type : s
B :  So all you 're missing is some last syllables or something or the last word or some highly predictable words .

dialogue type : s
B :  So technically , it 's an overlap .

dialogue type : s
B :  But you know , from information flow point of view it 's not an overlap in the predictable information .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Well , that 's exactly , exactly why we wanted to study the precise timing of overlaps ins in uh Switchboard ,

dialogue type : s
B :  say , because there 's a lot of that .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , I was thinking you should be able to do this from the acoustics , on the close - talking mikes ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  right .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , not as well as what I mean , you wouldn't be able to have any kind of typology , obviously ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but you 'd get some rough statistics .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  I guess my my first comment was , um only that um we should n not attribute overlaps only to meetings ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but maybe that 's obvious ,

dialogue type : s
B :  maybe everybody knew that ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but that in normal conversation with two people there 's an awful lot of the same kinds of overlap ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and that it would be interesting to look at whether there are these kinds of constraints that Jane mentioned , that what maybe the additional people add to this competition that happens right after a turn ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  you know , because now you can have five people trying to grab the turn ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but pretty quickly there 're they back off

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and you go back to this sort of only one person at a time with one person interrupting at a time .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , I don't know .

dialogue type : s
B :  To answer your question I it I don't think it 's crucial to have controls

dialogue type : s
B :  but I think it 's worth recording all the meetings we can .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , um you know .

dialogue type : s
B :  D I wouldn't not record a two - person meeting just because it only has two people .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Can we actually record ?

dialogue type : qy.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's what they did on Map Task , you know , this Map Task corpus ?

dialogue type : s
B :  They ran exactly the same pairs of people with and without visual cues

dialogue type : sj
B :  and it 's quite interesting .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs^j
B :  Well , we could just put b blindfolds on .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  and we 'd take a picture of everybody sitting here with blindfolds .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^arp
B :  But probably from these you could 've infer it .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  It would be a research task .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  But you have to keep the chairs in the same pla like here .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  The fashion statement .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  But does it work for that one speaker throughout the whole meeting ?

dialogue type : s^cs^na
B :  I think that 'd be really interesting too , with blindfolds .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Well , trying with and with and without , yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  But then there 's just one @ @ , like .

dialogue type : s
B :  Oh , yeah , that 's really common .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  It 's very difficult if you try while you 're trying , say , to convince somebody on the phone it 's difficult not to move your hands .

dialogue type : s
B :  Not You know , if you watch people they 'll actually do these things .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I still think we should try a a meeting or two with the blindfolds ,

dialogue type : s
B :  at least of this meeting that we have lots of recordings of

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Um , maybe for part of the meeting , we don't have to do it the whole meeting .

dialogue type : sj
B :  That could be fun .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 'll be too hard to make barriers , I was thinking because they have to go all the way

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  you know , I can see Chuck even if you put a barrier here .

dialogue type : qy^bh^d^rt
B :  Y Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  But then we also have these mikes , is the other thing I was thinking ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  so we need a barrier that doesn't disturb the sound ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um

dialogue type : sj
B :  I mean , it sounds weird but but you know it 's it 's cheap and , uh Be interesting to have the camera going .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  I think the beep is a really good idea .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Notice how quiet I am .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  You have some people who only have beeps as their speech in these meetings .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah , definitely .

dialogue type : qy^d
B :  So I guess if there 's an overlap , like , if I 'm saying something that 's bleepable and somebody else overlaps during it they also get bleeped , too ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And , I wanted to say , I think this is really interesting analysis .

dialogue type : s
B :  I meant to say that before I started off on the Switchboard stuff .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  It 's neat .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qw.%-
B :  How long does it take , just briefly , like t to OK . to label the ,

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  It 's really neat .

dialogue type : s^cc.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  I feel like this troublemaker .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : z
B :  I 'm sorry .
