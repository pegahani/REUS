dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
D :  Something like that .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's the , uh , point .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
D :  We 'll show you .

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  No .

dialogue type : s^2:s
D :  Are pl playing at the cinema ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I changed that file , actually , where it 's on my account .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  You want to get it ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Or is di was it easy to get it ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  Yeah , I mean I changed those sentences to make it , uh , more , uh , idiomatic .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , of course , you can have i many variations in those sentences , they will still parse fine .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , in a sense it 's pretty broad .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  One thing I was wondering , was , those functions there , are those things that modify the M - three - L basically ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  AV medium .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  " See " .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s|s^f
D :  One thing I was wondering was , those percentage signs , right ?

dialogue type : qw
D :  So , I mean , why do we even have them ?

dialogue type : s^df.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s|s^bk
D :  So that 's the main purpose . Alright .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Fine , yeah .

dialogue type : fg|qw.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s|s^f
D :  those functions " Action " , " Goodbye " , and so on , right ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Are they actually , um , Are they going to be called ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Um , are they present in the code for the parser ?

dialogue type : qw
D :  What are you looking for ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  No , that 's not it .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bu^rt:s
D :  M - three - L dot DTD ?

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's just a specification for the XML format .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think each of those functions act on the current XML structure , and change it in some way , for example , by adding a a l a field to it , or something .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
D :  Oh , you mean that 's not going to actually modify the tree ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but it 's going to change the event .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh . Oh .

dialogue type : s
D :  When there 's a feature .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  Right there .

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  But there is some kind of function call ,

dialogue type : qw^df
D :  because how does it know to put Goodbye in Content , but , uh , Confirm in Features ?

dialogue type : fh
D :  So

dialogue type : s
D :  So , it 's not just that it 's adding that field .

dialogue type : %-
D :  It 's

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  Well , they 're defined somewhere , presumably .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Ooo !

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  Yeah , I thought I should , um , talk a little bit about that ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because that might be a good , uh , sort of architecture to have , in general for , uh , problems with , you know , multiple inputs to a node .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
D : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  should I Is there a white board here that I can use ?

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : qrr
D :  Or shall I just use this ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Hey !

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
D :  So , um Recall that , uh , we want to have this kind of structure in our Bayes - nets .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  Namely , that , um You have these nodes that have several bands , right ?

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  the typical example is that , um , these are all a bunch of cues for something ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and this is a certain effect that we 'd like to conclude .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  Like , let 's just look at the case when , um , this is actually the the final action , right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So this is like , uh , you know , touch ,

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s^fa
D :  Sorry .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Uh

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^m|qy^d^f^g
D :  E - EVA , right ?

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  Enter , V View , Approach , right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  Enter ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  View ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  Approach .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  So , I mean , we 'd like to take all these various cues , right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , let me pick a random one

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s^df^rt
D :  it could be , like This isn't the way it really is ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  but let me say that , suppose someone mentioned , uh , admission fees

dialogue type : s^ba^bd
D :  Ah , it takes too long .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  Try let me just say " Landmark " .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
D :  if it 's closed or not , at the moment .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  Alright , so you have nodes .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  And the , uh , problem that we were having was that , you know , given N - nodes , there 's " two to the N "

dialogue type : s
D :  Given N - nodes , and furthermore , the fact that there 's three things here , we need to specify " three times " , uh , " two to the N " probabilities .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's assuming these are all binary , which f they may not be .

dialogue type : s
D :  For example , they could be " time of day " ,

dialogue type : s
D :  in which case we could , uh , say , you know , " Morning , afternoon , evening , night " .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , this could be more

dialogue type : s
D :  So , it 's a lot , anyway .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , that 's a lot of probabilities to put here , which is kind of a pain .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  So Noisy - ORs are a way to , uh , sort of deal with this .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um

dialogue type : qw^t1
D :  Where should I put this ?

dialogue type : s:s
D :  So , the idea is that , um , Let 's call these , uh , C - one , C - two , C - three , and C - four , and E , for Cause and Effect , I guess .

dialogue type : s
D :  The idea is to have these intermediate nodes .

dialogue type : s^f
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , actually , the idea , first of all , is that each of these things has a quote - unquote distinguished state ,

dialogue type : s
D :  which means that this is the state in which we don't really know anything about it .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So , for example , if we don't really know if the thing is a landmark or not , Or , i if that just doesn't seem relevant , then that would be th sort of the Disting - the Distinguish state .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  It 's a really , you know , if there is something for the person talking about the admission fee ,

dialogue type : s
D :  you know , if they didn't talk about it , that would be the Distinguish state .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's just what they the word they used in that paper .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  So , the idea is that , um , you have these intermediate nodes , right ?

dialogue type : s^rt:s^rt
D :  E - one , E - two , E - three and E - four ?

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  So The idea is that , each of these EI is represents what this would be if all the other ones were in the distinguish state . Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So , for example , suppose that the person I mean , suppose the thing that they talked about is a landmark .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  But none of the other sort of cues really apply .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  W The this would just represent the probability distribution of this ,

dialogue type : s
D :  assuming that this cue is turned on and the other ones just didn't apply ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So , you know , if it is a landmark , and no none of the other things really ap applicable , then this would represent the probability distribution .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So maybe in this case Maybe we just t k Maybe we decide that , if the thing 's a landmark and we don't know anything else , then we 're gonna conclude that , um They want to view it with probability , you know , point four .

dialogue type : s
D :  They want to enter it with probability , uh with probability point five

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So we come up with these l little tables for each of those

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  And the final thing is that , um this is a deterministic function of these ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so we don't need to specify any probabilities .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  We just have to , um , say what function this is , right ?

dialogue type : s:s|qy^d^f^g
D :  So we can let this be , um G of E - one comma E - two . E - three , E - four . Right ?

dialogue type : s^rt:s
D :  and our example G would be , um , a majority vote ?

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  it 's Heckerman and Breese .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Uh , you can Yeah , you should take a look at it , I guess .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
D :  Yeah , it 's a good question .

dialogue type : h|s
D :  Um The so what we want , is basically JavaBayes to support deterministic , uh , functions .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  And , um In a sense it sup we can make it supported by , um , manually , uh , entering , you know , probabilities that are one and zeros , right ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  I don't think you can do this ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because G is a function from that to that .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So there 's no numbers .

dialogue type : s
D :  There 's just quadruplets of well , N - duplets of , uh , E Vs .

dialogue type : s^fa^t1
D :  Oops , sorry .

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , right .

dialogue type : s^m.%--
D :  W would not be ab able to observe

dialogue type : qw^br
D :  What ?

dialogue type : b.%
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bu^d
D :  Oh . A are you saying that we 'll not be able to observe certain nodes ?

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  That 's fine .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  That is sort of orthogonal thing .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So , specifically in this case you have to f have this many numbers ,

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  whereas in this case you just have to have three for this , three for this , three for this . Right ?

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So you have to have just three N ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So , this is much smaller than that .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know .

dialogue type : fg|s:s
D :  Yeah . This isn't a Noisy - OR anymore .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  it 's a Noisy - arg - max or a Noisy - whatever .

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  Well , the " OR " .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Right . I guess you 're right .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : qw
D :  Where else would it be stored ?

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's the question .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  So , is the idea to put it in the ontology ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  So , we are but we we 're not doing the ontology ,

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
D :  so we have to get to whoever is doing the u ultimately ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : fg|%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  That requires understanding the classes in JavaBayes , I guess . @ @ .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Ah !

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't see why the , uh , combining f functions have to be directly hacked into

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I mean , they 're used to create tables

dialogue type : s
D :  so we can just make our own little functions that create tables in XML .

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , OK .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
D :  So say it blows up , right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So there 's , like , the you know , ten , f ten , fifteen , uh , things .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's gonna be like , two to the that ,

dialogue type : s
D :  which isn't so bad .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  p Sure .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yep .
