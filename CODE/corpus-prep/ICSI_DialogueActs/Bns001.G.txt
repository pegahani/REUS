dialogue type : z
G :  OK ,

dialogue type : z
G :  Hey , Adam , you know what ?

dialogue type : z
G :  It must be funny to do an a research on how people behave while reading these numbers .

dialogue type : z
G :  That must be

dialogue type : z
G :  Yeah !

dialogue type : z
G :  It must be much more interesting to to see their behavior .

dialogue type : z
G :  Oh y yeah !

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
G :  Ah .

dialogue type : s^fa
G :  Sorry .

dialogue type : qy.%-
G :  Can I ?

dialogue type : s
G :  Maybe I can add something .

dialogue type : s
G :  Yeah , if there 's anything else which we what we could add on the web site .

dialogue type : s
G :  So , p For example , if you have a small abstract or some pictures or whatever , about the work you did before , what you are planning to do here , that would be fine ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  cuz now we can add some more stuff there .

dialogue type : s
G :  Or if you have something or if somebody has some slides , o or articles , whatever he wants to be published there .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah

dialogue type : fh
G :  and

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ng
G :  Yeah , it depends what what everybody wants to do .

dialogue type : fg
G :  So

dialogue type : s
G :  about the projects will be something ,

dialogue type : s
G :  then , about publications will be another point ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and Yeah , additional information about how is life in Berkeley and i Yep . I don't know , some some hints , some web sites or links which are useful when somebody arrives or stuff like that .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
G :  Oh , oh , no , I 'm not doing it for everybody

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
G :  Yeah , but but what is planned is that I do something like a previous , you know , layout , and give everybody the , uh , opin uh , the possibility to the chance to put his content inside

dialogue type : s^df
G :  so that the layout is for everybody the same ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  so about the projects and stuff .

dialogue type : s
G :  So , there will be something .

dialogue type : qw^rt
G :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
G :  Oh !

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
G :  Yeah , but the task changed really a lot ,

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  so , I 'd I rather would like to

dialogue type : s^bk|s
G :  Yeah , but I 'd rather like to follow the discussion before I gave any comments ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  cuz it 's really The first point is it 's much more than it was before I left ,

dialogue type : s:s^fe
G :  so it 's like five weeks in between , so it 's like that whew !

dialogue type : s
G :  that big now .

dialogue type : s
G :  And it really changed a lot

dialogue type : s^df
G :  cuz the I mean I found the classroom inside

dialogue type : s
G :  but , the thing where I left the discussion was that we are talking about uh a classroom where you know everybody could look on with any kind of device and follow lectures or do exercise or whatever .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s
G :  Now we are talking about something which is much more precise

dialogue type : s
G :  and the the range of stuff is maybe more narrow than before

dialogue type : s
G :  so I 'd rather like to to follow it a bit , and then to get more into the ideas .

dialogue type : qw
G :  What do you mean by " put together " ?

dialogue type : b
G :  Ah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  So why I wasn't ,

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  well , yeah , uh hold myself back a bit with comments , is uh cuz when I left the discussion , the discussion was what to to have something like a big umbrella about everybody who was at this point , here .

dialogue type : s
G :  And so the discussion was much broader than it is maybe right now .

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  And there I had the impression the umbrella was this kind of classroom thing .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  Right ?

dialogue type : qrr^d
G :  Or wrong ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
G :  Yeah , yeah , yeah . It is .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  Of course .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  That 's that 's clear .

dialogue type : %-
G :  But

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
G :  Yeah , that 's that 's clear ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G :  because when we were discussion discussing this uh stuff weeks ago , uh I had the impression that , you know , everything of these work packages uh fit together under this one big umbrella .

dialogue type : s
G :  And now it sounds different .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  So that 's what I don't understand .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Ah but , it 's also because I missed the last four weeks .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's a a bit hard for me to follow the development what happened in the last four weeks ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  why it changed so .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G :  So Cuz what 's difficult for me is what is meant by " application " ?

dialogue type : s^df
G :  So . Cuz I have sometimes the impression that everybody is defining " application " in different way .

dialogue type : qw
G :  So , what exactly is mean by " application " ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  So what has changed is that we 're not only focussing on this intelligent classroom , but on everything .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap|s^ng
G :  Yeah but there 's something needed to sell it .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^t3
G :  Bless you .

dialogue type : s
G :  Do not Don't switch it off .
