dialogue type : s^fa^t3
A :  Sorry .

dialogue type : h|s^rt
A :  Um , still working on my my quals preparation stuff .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , so I 'm I 'm thinking about , um , starting some , uh , cheating experiments to , uh , determine the , um the relative effectiveness of , um , some intermediate categories that I want to classify .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  So , for example , um , if I know where voicing occurs and everything , um , I would do a phone um , phone recognition experiment ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
A :  um , somehow putting in the the , uh the perfect knowledge that I have about voicing .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  So , um , in particular I was thinking , um , in in the hybrid framework , just taking those LNA files , and , um , setting to zero those probabilities that , um that these phones are not voicing .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  So say , like , I know this particular segment is voicing ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
A :  um , I would say , uh , go into the corresponding LNA file and zonk out the the posteriors for , um , those phonemes that , um , are not voiced ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and then see what kinds of improvements I get .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  And so this would be a useful thing , um , to know in terms of , like , which which , um which of these categories are are good for , um , speech recognition .

dialogue type : fh|%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  I hope to get those , uh those experiments done by by the time quals come come around in July .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
A :  OK , so just set to set to some really low number , the the non - voiced , um , phones .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
A :  And then renormalize .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %--
A :  m

dialogue type : fh|s
A : 

dialogue type : s^e
A :  TIMIT uh , phone recognition with TIMIT .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , the outputs of the net go into the standard , h um , ICSI hybrid , um , recognizer .

dialogue type : s
A :  So maybe , um , Chronos

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  Phone recognition .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right , right .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
A :  And , uh , another thing would be to extend this to , uh , digits or something where I can look at whole words .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  And I would be able to see , uh , not just , like , phoneme events , but , um , inter - phoneme events .

dialogue type : s^e
A :  So , like , this is from a stop to to a vo a vocalic

dialogue type : s^e
A :  segment .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  You know ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  so something that is transitional in nature .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that 's that 's it .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .
