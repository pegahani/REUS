dialogue type : z
E :  So .

dialogue type : z
E :  OK . Doesn't look like it crashed .

dialogue type : z
E :  That 's great .

dialogue type : z
E :  And start by giving the transcript number .

dialogue type : s^j
E :  So uh , you see , Don , the unbridled excitement of the work that we have on this project .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  It 's just uh

dialogue type : h|s^na
E :  Uh , you know , it doesn't seem like a bad idea to have that information .

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%-
E :  Yeah , I I 'd I think it 's some

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^t
E :  Um , so I I do have a a an agenda suggestion .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Uh , we I think the things that we talk about in this meeting uh tend to be a mixture of uh procedural uh mundane things and uh research points

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  and um I was thinking I think it was a meeting a couple

dialogue type : s
E :  and then we sort of drifted into the research and maybe five minutes into that Andreas had to leave .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
E :  So uh I 'm suggesting we turn it around

dialogue type : s^co
E :  and and uh sort of we have anybody has some mundane points that we could send an email later , uh hold them for a bit , and let 's talk about the the research - y kind of things .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um , so um the one th one thing I know that we have on that is uh we had talked a a couple weeks before um uh about the uh the stuff you were doing with with uh um uh l l attempting to locate events ,

dialogue type : s:s
E :  we had a little go around trying to figure out what you meant by " events "

dialogue type : s:s
E :  but I think , you know , what we had meant by " events " I guess was uh points of overlap between speakers .

dialogue type : s
E :  But I th I gather from our discussion a little earlier today that you also mean uh interruptions with something else

dialogue type : s^e
E :  like some other noise .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  Yes ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  You mean that as an event also .

dialogue type : s
E :  So at any rate you were you 've you 've done some work on that

dialogue type : fh|s^cs^t
E :  and um then the other thing would be it might be nice to have a preliminary discussion of some of the other uh research uh areas that uh we 're thinking about doing .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um , I think especially since you you haven't been in in these meetings for a little bit ,

dialogue type : s^t
E :  maybe you have some discussion of some of the p the plausible things to look at now that we 're starting to get data ,

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  uh and one of the things I know that also came up uh is some discussions that that uh that uh Jane had with Lokendra

dialogue type : s^e.%--
E :  uh about some some some um uh work about

dialogue type : s
E :  I I I d I I don't want to try to say cuz I I 'll say it wrong ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but anyway some some potential collaboration there about about the about the working with these data .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So , uh .

dialogue type : h|s^nd
E :  Uh . Well , I don't know if we if this is sort of like everybody has something to contribute sort of thing ,

dialogue type : s^df^e
E :  I think there 's just just a couple a couple people primarily

dialogue type : fh
E :  um but um

dialogue type : fh|qh^cs.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  Actually I think that that last one I just said we could do fairly quickly

dialogue type : qh^cs
E :  so why don't you you start with that .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^co
E :  Yeah , just explain what it was .

dialogue type : fg|s^df
E :  Well , I I should maybe interject to say this started off with a discussion that I had with him ,

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  so um we were trying to think of ways that his interests could interact with ours

dialogue type : fh|s^cs.x
E :  and um uh I thought that if we were going to project into the future when we had a lot of data , uh and um such things might be useful for that in or before we invested too much uh effort into that he should uh , with Jane 's help , look into some of the data that we 're already have

dialogue type : s^e:qy
E :  and see , is there anything to this at all ?

dialogue type : s:qy
E :  Is there any point which you think that , you know , you could gain some advantage and some potential use for it .

dialogue type : sj^df.%--:s
E :  Cuz it could be that you 'd look through it and you say " well , this is just the wrong task for for him to pursue his "

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  And and uh I got the impression from your mail that in fact there was enough things like this just in the little sample that that you looked at that that it 's plausible at least .

dialogue type : b.%
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  So anyway , that 's that 's e a quite different thing from anything we 've talked about that , you know , might might might come out from some of this .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs.x
E :  I mean , he certainly could use text ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  but we were in fact looking to see if there is there is there something in common between our interest in meetings and his interest in in in this stuff .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^no
E :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s
E :  probably de probably depends on what the prepared writing was .

dialogue type : fh
E :  But .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^am
E :  Could be .

dialogue type : s^aa.%-
E :  Yeah . That would be tou

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^df.x
E :  I probably been affect No , I th I think I 've been affected by too many conversations where we were talking about lawyers and talking about and concerns about " oh gee is somebody going to say something bad ? " and so on .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar|%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No no , it isn't sensitive at all .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  I was just I was just I was overreacting just because we 've been talking about it .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : s^na
E :  Yeah , well , there 's that .

dialogue type : s^arp
E :  But I I mean I think also to some extent it 's just educating the Human Subjects people , in a way ,

dialogue type : s^df
E : 

dialogue type : s^e
E :  I mean people say people 's names all the time .

dialogue type : sj
E :  So I think it it can't be bad to say people 's names .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  It 's just that i I mean you 're right that there 's more poten If we never say anybody 's name , then there 's no chance of of of slandering anybody ,

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Right , so I So my behavior is probably not natural .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah , we really can't .

dialogue type : s^tc
E :  But a actually , I 'm sorry . I really would like to push finish this off .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah , I di I didn't intend it an a policy though .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  It was it was just it was just unconscious well , semi - conscious behavior .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^no.x:s
E :  I I do I don't remember who " he " is .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Ah .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Uh , we were talking about Dan at one point and we were talking about Lokendra at another point .

dialogue type : s^no
E :  And I don't I don't remember which which part .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah . Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : b
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Yeah , you could do all these inferences ,

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
E :  Um , I I would like to move it into into uh what Jose uh has been doing

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because he 's actually been doing something .

dialogue type : b.%
E :  So . Right .

dialogue type : qw
E :  How many overlaps were there uh in it ?

dialogue type : s^ar|qw
E :  No no , how many of them were the overlaps of speech , though ?

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^ar|qy^bu
E :  No no , but I think what she 's asking is if at some particular for some particular stretch you had three people talking , instead of two , did you call that one event ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  I see .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Yeah . So I think Yeah . We just wanted to understand how you 're defining it .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  So then , in the region between since there there is some continuous region , in between regions where there is only one person speaking .

dialogue type : s^bu
E :  And one contiguous region like that you 're calling an event .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
E :  Is it Are you calling the beginning or the end of it the event ,

dialogue type : qrr
E :  or are you calling the entire length of it the event ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Got it .

dialogue type : s^am
E :  Could .

dialogue type : s^aa.%-
E :  Yeah . We just w

dialogue type : s^bu
E :  So again , that 's that 's three three hundred in forty - five minutes that are that are speakers , just speakers .

dialogue type : h|s
E :  Uh - huh . OK . Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  So that 's about eight per minute .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|qw
E :  OK , so how many of those thousand were silence ?

dialogue type : s^bk.x
E :  Right .

dialogue type : qw^r
E :  So how many of those thousand were silence , silent sections ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  The the the far - field ,

dialogue type : b
E :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah , well , just I mean , just in that that one s ten second , or whatever it was , example that Adam had that that we we passed on to others a few months ago ,

dialogue type : s
E :  there was that business where I g I guess it was Adam and Jane were talking at the same time

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  and and uh , in the close - talking mikes you couldn't hear the overlap , and in the distant mike you could .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
E :  So yeah , it 's clear that if you wanna study if you wanna find all the places where there were overlap , it 's probably better to use a distant mike .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  On the other hand , there 's other phenomena that are going on at the same time for which it might be useful to look at the close - talking mikes ,

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  Some of it 's masking masked .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
E :  No i

dialogue type : s.x
E :  Well , it 'd be hard , but on the other hand as you point out , if your if i if if your concern is to get uh the overlapping people people 's speech , you will you will get that somewhat better .

dialogue type : fh|qy^rt.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  uh you were you were working with th the data that had already been transcribed .

dialogue type : qy.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yes .

dialogue type : fh|qy^rt
E :  Now um did you make any use of that ?

dialogue type : s
E :  See I was wondering cuz we st we have these ten hours of other stuff that is not yet transcribed .

dialogue type : qy.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : fg
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bs
E :  So the twelve you you it took you twelve hours of course this included maybe some some time where you were learning about what what you wanted to do ,

dialogue type : s^bs.%-
E :  but but uh , it took you something like twelve hours to mark the forty - five minutes , your

dialogue type : s^fe^m
E :  s Twelve minutes !

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , you haven't done the whole session .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  This is just twelve minutes .

dialogue type : s^fe
E :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^co
E :  So let me back up again .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  So the when you said there were three hundred speaker overlaps ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  that 's in twelve minutes ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk^r
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
E :  So it 's three hundred in forty - five minutes ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but you have you have time uh , uh marked twelve minute the the the um overlaps in twelve minutes of it .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Got it .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  Well , I but I have a suggestion about that .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um , obviously this is very , very time - consuming , and you 're finding lots of things

dialogue type : s^ba^df
E :  which I 'm sure are gonna be very interesting ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  but in the interests of making progress , uh might I s

dialogue type : qw^cs
E :  how how would it affect your time if you only marked speaker overlaps ?

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^co
E :  Do not mark any other events ,

dialogue type : s^co^rt
E : 

dialogue type : qy
E :  Do you think that would speed it up quite a bit ?

dialogue type : qy^r^rt
E :  Do y do you think that would speed it up ?

dialogue type : h|qy^d^rt
E :  Uh , speed up your your your marking ?

dialogue type : s
E :  It took you a long time to mark twelve minutes .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
E : 

dialogue type : fg|qy
E :  Yeah , and my question is , if you did that , if you followed my suggestion , would it take much less time ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah OK .

dialogue type : sj^ba
E :  Then I think it 's a good idea .

dialogue type : sj^ba^r.%-
E :  Then I think it 's a good idea , because it

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah , I mean , we we know that there 's noise .

dialogue type : s
E :  There 's there 's uh continual noise uh from fans and so forth ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and there is uh more impulsive noise from uh taps and so forth

dialogue type : s
E :  and and something in between with paper rustling .

dialogue type : s
E :  We know that all that 's there

dialogue type : sj^ba
E :  and it 's a g worthwhile thing to study ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but obviously it takes a lot of time to mark all of these things .

dialogue type : sj
E :  Whereas th i I would think that uh you we can study more or less as a distinct phenomenon the overlapping of people talking .

dialogue type : h|s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  And and you need to have a lot more than that to have any kind of uh even visual sense of of what 's going on , much less any kind of reasonable statistics .

dialogue type : h|s^co
E :  Um , OK , yeah . So let 's back up because you weren't here for an earlier conversation .

dialogue type : s^bs
E :  So the idea was that what he was going to be doing was experimenting with different measures

dialogue type : s^e.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean there 's a bunch of things I mean , increased energy is - is sort of an obvious one .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Um , and uh , it 's not obvious ,

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  I mean , you could you could do the dumbest thing and get get it ninety percent of the time .

dialogue type : s
E :  But when you start going past that and trying to do better , it 's not obvious what combination of features is gonna give you the you know , the right detector .

dialogue type : s
E :  So the idea is to have some ground truth first .

dialogue type : s
E :  And so the i the idea of the manual marking was to say " OK this , i you know , it 's it 's really here " .

dialogue type : h|s^no^rt
E :  Uh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  We t we t w we t we talked about that .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
E :  We we we talked about that .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  s But so it 's a bootstrapping thing and the thing is ,

dialogue type : s^bs^rt
E :  the idea was , i we i i we thought it would be useful for him to look at the data anyway ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and and then whatever he could mark would be helpful ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  and we could Uh

dialogue type : s
E :  it 's a question of what you bootstrap from .

dialogue type : qy
E :  You know , do you bootstrap from a simple measurement which is right most of the time and then you g do better ,

dialogue type : qrr
E :  or do you bootstrap from some human being looking at it and then then do your simple measurements , uh from the close - talking mike .

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , even with the close - talking mike you 're not gonna get it right all the time .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Well

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
E :  Right , we discussed that .

dialogue type : s^bd
E :  It 's OK .

dialogue type : s^co
E :  See , this is where we really need the Meeting Recorder query stuff to be working ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because we 've had these meetings and we 've had this discussion about this , and I 'm sort of remembering a little bit about what we decided ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but I couldn't remember all of it .

dialogue type : fh|sj
E :  So , I think it was partly that , you know , give somebody a chance to actually look at the data and see what these are like , partly that we have e some ground truth to compare against , you know , when when he he gets his thing going ,

dialogue type : fh|%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  That was that was exactly the notion that that that we discussed .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^t3
E :  S See ya .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap
E :  But but that 's a refinement

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  and I think we wanna see try the simple thing first ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  cuz you add this complex thing up uh afterwards that does something good y y yo you sort of wanna see what the simple thing does first .

dialogue type : s
E :  But uh , having having somebody have some experience , again , with with uh with marking it from a human standpoint ,

dialogue type : s
E :  we 're I mean , I don't expect Jose to to do it for uh f fifty hours of of speech ,

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  but I mean we if uh if he could speed up what he was doing by just getting the speaker overlaps so that we had it , say , for forty - five minutes , then at least we 'd have three hundred examples of it .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  And when when uh Adam was doing his automatic thing he could then compare to that and see what it was different .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
E :  Oh , then everybody owns it .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's the people .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^j.x
E :  Yeah , good enough for government work , as they say .

dialogue type : fg|s^no.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fh|s^tc
E :  So , uh , maybe we should move on to other other things in limited time .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^t
E :  So so I was gonna ask , I guess about any any other things that that that either of you wanted to talk about ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  especially since Andreas is leaving in five minutes ,

dialogue type : s
E :  that that you wanna go with .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Right so there 's this this There 's this forty - five minute piece that Jane transcribed .

dialogue type : s
E :  That piece was then uh sent to IBM so they could transcribe so we have some comparison point .

dialogue type : s.x
E :  Then there 's s a larger piece that 's been recorded and uh put on CD - ROM and sent uh to IBM .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^no
E :  And then we don't know .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
E :  Oh , that 's right , that had those have not been sent .

dialogue type : s
E :  We 're saying about twelve hours .

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^rt
E :  No , so the the that 's the that 's the biggest one uh , chunk so far ,

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  but there 's at least one meeting recorded of uh the uh uh natural language guys .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : h|s^aa^rt
E :  Uh , they do .

dialogue type : s
E :  w w And we talked to them about recording some more

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  and we 're going to ,

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
E :  uh , we 've started having a morning meeting , today uh i starting a w a week or two ago , on the uh front - end issues ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and we 're recording those ,

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  uh there 's a network services and applications group here who 's agreed to have their meetings recorded ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and we 're gonna start recording them .

dialogue type : s
E :  They 're They meet on Tuesdays . We 're gonna start recording them next week .

dialogue type : s
E :  So actually , we 're gonna h start having a a pretty significant chunk

dialogue type : fh
E :  and

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  so , you know , Adam 's sort of struggling with trying to get things to be less buggy , and come up quicker when they do crash and stuff things like that ,

dialogue type : s
E :  now that uh the things are starting to happen .

dialogue type : s
E :  So right now , yeah , I th I 'd say the data is predominantly meeting meetings ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  but there are scattered other meetings in it and that that amount is gonna grow

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  i if we 're if we collect fifty or sixty hours , the meeting meetings it will probably be , you know , twenty or thirty percent of it ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  not not not eighty or ninety .

dialogue type : fh
E :  But .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^no.%--
E :  Yeah and th the the other thing is I 'm not pos

dialogue type : s^no.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
E :  maybe you wanna do it once for the novelty ,

dialogue type : s^no
E :  but I don't know if in general we wanna have meetings that we record from outside this group do the digits .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Because it 's just an added bunch of weird stuff .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  And , you know , we we h we 're highly motivated .

dialogue type : s
E :  Uh in fact , the morning group is really motivated

dialogue type : s^df
E :  cuz they 're working on connected digits ,

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s^aa
E :  Uh , yeah , I I think

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  definitely s so Absolutely .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Yeah , whoever we have working on the acoustics for the Meeting Recorder are gonna start with that .

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  I mean , one of the things I wanted to do , uh , that I I talked to to Don about , is one of the possible things he could do or m also , we could have someone else do it , is to do block echo cancellation ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  to try to get rid of some of the effects of the the the far - field effects .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um , I mean we have the party line has been that echo cancellation is not the right way to handle the situation

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because people move around ,

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  and uh , if if it 's if it 's uh not a simple echo , like a cross - talk kind of echo , but it 's actually room acoustics , it 's it 's it 's you can't really do inversion ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and even echo cancellation is going to uh be something It may you Someone may be moving enough that you are not able to adapt quickly

dialogue type : s
E :  and so the tack that we 've taken is more " lets come up with feature approaches and multi - stream approaches and so forth , that will be robust to it for the recognizer and not try to create a clean signal " .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Uh , that 's the party line .

dialogue type : s
E :  But it occurred to me a few months ago that uh party lines are always , you know , sort of dangerous .

dialogue type : sj^cs
E :  It 's good good to sort of test them , actually .

dialogue type : s
E :  And so we haven't had anybody try to do a good serious job on echo cancellation and we should know how well that can do .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
E :  So that 's something I 'd like somebody to do at some point , just take these digits , take the far - field mike signal , and the close uh mike signal , and apply really good echo cancellation .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
E :  Um , there was a have been some nice talks recently by by Lucent on on their b

dialogue type : s
E :  the block echo cancellation particularly appealed to me ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
E :  uh you know , trying and change it sample by sample , but you have some reasonable sized blocks . And um , you know , th

dialogue type : h|s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : qw.%--
E :  Uh , what 's the difference in If you were trying to construct a linear filter , that would

dialogue type : fh.x
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  that would subtract off the um uh parts of the signal that were the aspects of the signal that were different between the close - talk and the distant .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
E : 

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Yeah , so you 're trying to So you 'd There 's a a distance between the close and the distant mikes so there 's a time delay there ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and after the time delay , there 's these various reflections .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  there 's a a least squares algorithm that adjusts itself adjusts the weight so that you try to subtract essentially to subtract off uh different uh different reflections .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  Right ? So let 's take the simple case where you just had you had some uh some delay in a satellite connection or something

dialogue type : s
E :  and then there 's a there 's an echo .

dialogue type : s
E :  It comes back . And you want to adjust this filter so that it will maximally reduce the effect of this echo .

dialogue type : s^ng.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , when I 'm talking to you right now , you 're getting the direct sound from my speech ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but you 're also getting , uh , the indirect sound that 's bounced around the room a number of times .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
E :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
E :  So now , if you um try to r you To completely remove the effect of that is sort of impractical for a number of technical reasons ,

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  not to try to completely remove it , that is , invert the the room response ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but just to try to uh uh eliminate some of the the effect of some of the echos .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um , a number of people have done this

dialogue type : s
E :  so that , say , if you 're talking to a speakerphone , uh it makes it more like it would be , if you were talking right up to it .

dialogue type : s
E :  So this is sort of the st the straight - forward approach .

dialogue type : s
E :  You say I I I want to use this uh this item but I want to subtract off various kinds of echos .

dialogue type : s
E :  So you construct a filter , and you have this this filtered version uh of the speech um gets uh uh gets subtracted off from the original speech .

dialogue type : s
E :  Then you try to you try to minimize the energy in some sense .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  And so um uh with some constraints .

dialogue type : s^aa^m
E :  It 's a clean up thing . Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  So , echo cancelling is is , you know , commonly done in telephony ,

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  and and and it 's sort of the obvious thing to do in this situation if you if , you know , you 're gonna be talking some distance from a mike .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
E :  Right . So it 's taking samples , it 's doing adaptation , it 's adjusting weights ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and then it 's getting the sum .

dialogue type : fh|s.x
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  somebody look And and the digits would be a reasonable thing to do that with .

dialogue type : s
E :  I think that 'd be enough data plenty of data to do that with ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and i for that sort of task you wouldn't care whether it was uh large vocabulary speech or anything .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh . Um

dialogue type : s
E :  Brian 's Kingsbury 's work is an example of what we did f f from the opposite dogma .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  Right ?

dialogue type : s:s
E :  Which is what I was calling the " party line " , which is that uh doing that sort of thing is not really what we want .

dialogue type : s
E :  We want something more flexible , uh i i where people might change their position ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : %--
E :  There 's also um

dialogue type : s^fe
E :  oh yeah ,

dialogue type : s
E :  noise .

dialogue type : s
E :  So the echo cancellation does not really allow for noise .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's if you have a clean situation but you just have some delays ,

dialogue type : s
E :  Then we 'll figure out the right the right set of weights for your taps for your filter in order to produce the effect of those those echos .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  But um if there 's noise , then the very signal that it 's looking at is corrupted

dialogue type : s
E :  so that it 's decision about what the right you know , right right uh delays are is , uh is right delayed signal is is is uh is incorrect .

dialogue type : s
E :  And so , in a noisy situation , um , also in a in a situation that 's very reverberant with long reverberation times and really long delays , it 's it 's sort of typically impractical .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  So for those kind of reasons ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  and also a a c a complete inversion ,

dialogue type : s
E :  if you actually I mentioned that it 's kind of hard to really do the inversion of the room acoustics .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um , that 's difficult because um often times the the um the system transfer function is such that when it 's inverted you get something that 's unstable ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and so , if you you do your estimate of what the system is , and then you try to invert it , you get a filter that actually uh , you know , rings , and and uh goes to infinity .

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean there 's all sorts of all sorts of reasons why it 's not really practical .

dialogue type : s
E :  So for all those kinds of reasons , uh we we we sort of um , concluded we didn't want to in do inversion ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and we 're even pretty skeptical of echo cancellation , which isn't really inversion ,

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  and um we decided to do this approach of taking uh , just picking uh features , which were uh will give you more something that was more stable , in the presence of , or absence of , room reverberation ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and that 's what Brian was trying to do .

dialogue type : fh|s^tc
E :  So , um , let me just say a couple things that I was I was gonna bring up .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Uh . Let 's see . I guess you you actually already said this thing about the uh about the consent forms ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : qy^d.%--
E :  So this was the human subjects folks who said this , or that that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s^t
E :  Um , back on the data thing ,

dialogue type : s
E :  so there 's this sort of one hour , ten hour , a hundred hour sort of thing that that we have .

dialogue type : s
E :  We have we have an hour uh that that is transcribed ,

dialogue type : s
E :  we have we have twelve hours that 's recorded but not transcribed ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and at the rate we 're going , uh by the end of the semester we 'll have , I don't know , forty or fifty or something , if we if this really

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : qy
E :  Well , do we have that much ?

dialogue type : s^t1
E :  Let 's see ,

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  Eight weeks times three hours is twenty - four , so that 's Yeah , so like thirty thirty hours ?

dialogue type : s^arp
E :  But I don't think we 're gonna stop at the end of this semester .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  Right ?

dialogue type : sj
E :  So , I th I think that if we are able to keep that up for a few months , we are gonna have more like a hundred hours .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah , I was gonna mention that .

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah . So Yeah . So I I uh , I I 'd mentioned to Adam , and that was another thing I was gonna talk uh , mention to them before that uh there 's uh It it oc it occurred to me that we might be able to get some additional data by talking to uh acquaintances in local broadcast media .

dialogue type : s
E :  Because , you know , we had talked before about the problem about using found data , that that uh it 's just set up however they have it set up

dialogue type : s
E :  and we don't have any say about it

dialogue type : s
E :  and it 's typically one microphone ,

dialogue type : s
E :  in a , uh , uh or and and so it doesn't really give us the the the uh characteristics we want .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um and so I do think we 're gonna continue recording here and record what we can .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  But um , it did occur to me that we could go to friends in broadcast media and say " hey you have this panel show , or this you know , this discussion show , and um can you record multi - channel ? "

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  Well , they probably already use lapel ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but they might be able to have it it wouldn't be that weird for them to have another mike that was somewhat distant .

dialogue type : s
E :  It wouldn't be exactly this setup , but it would be that sort of thing ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and what we were gonna get from UW , you know , assuming they they they start recording , isn't als also is not going to be this exact setup .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , I I I I was thinking of looking into that .

dialogue type : s
E :  the other thing that occurred to me after we had that discussion , in fact , is that it 's even possible , since of course , many radio shows are not live , uh that we could invite them to have like some of their record some of their shows here .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  And and the I mean , the other side to it was the what which is where we were coming from I 'll I 'll talk to you more about it later is that is that there 's there 's uh

dialogue type : s
E :  the radio stations and television stations already have stuff worked out presumably , uh related to , you know , legal issues and and permissions and all that .

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , they already do what they do do whatever they do .

dialogue type : s
E :  So it 's uh , it 's So it 's so it 's another source .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  So I think it 's something we should look into ,

dialogue type : s
E :  you know , we 'll collect what we collect here

dialogue type : s
E :  hopefully they will collect more at UW also

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  and um and maybe we have this other source .

dialogue type : sj
E :  But yeah I think that it 's not unreasonable to aim at getting , you know , significantly in excess of a hundred hours .

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , that was sort of our goal .

dialogue type : s
E :  The thing was , I was hoping that we could @ @ in the under this controlled situation we could at least collect , you know , thirty to fifty hours .

dialogue type : s
E :  And at the rate we 're going we 'll get pretty close to that I think this semester .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^nd.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah . So I was thinking right now it 's sort of this exploratory stuff where you you look at the data , you use some primitive measures and get a feeling for what the scatter plots look like ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and and and uh and meanwhile we collect , and it 's more like yeah , three months from now , or six months from now you can you can do a lot of other things .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um , I mean the transcriptions I think are a bit of an unknown cuz we haven't gotten those back yet as far as the timing ,

dialogue type : sj
E :  but I think as far as the collection , it doesn't seem to me l like , uh , unreasonable to say that uh in January , you know , ro roughly uh which is roughly three months from now , we should have at least something like , you know , twenty - five , thirty hours .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , what we 're trying to stay away from was artificial constructions ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : qh^aa
E :  Why not ?

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I I b By the by the way , I don't think the transcriptions are actually , in the long run , such a big bottleneck .

dialogue type : sj
E :  I think the issue is just that we 're we 're blazing that path .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh|qy^rt
E :  And and um d Do you have any idea when when uh the you 'll be able to send uh the ten hours to them ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : s
E :  So early next week we send it to them ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and then then we check with them to see if they 've got it

dialogue type : s
E :  and we we start , you know asking about the timing for it .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  So I think once they get it sorted out about how they 're gonna do it , which I think they 're pretty well along on , cuz they were able to read the files and so on .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  Right ?

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Yeah , but You know , so they they they have you know , they 're volunteering their time and they have a lot of other things to do ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  right ?

dialogue type : s
E :  But they But at any rate , they 'll I I think once they get that sorted out , they 're they 're making cassettes there , then they 're handing it to someone who they who 's who is doing it ,

dialogue type : fh|sj
E :  and uh I think it 's not going to be I don't think it 's going to be that much more of a deal for them to do thirty hours then to do one hour ,

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  I think . It 's not going to be thirty

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's it 's just getting it going .

dialogue type : s^ng.%-
E : 

dialogue type : fg|s^co
E :  Yeah . Well , we should also check with Mari again , because they because they were really intending , you know , maybe just didn't happen , but they were really intending to be duplicating this in some level .

dialogue type : s
E :  So then that would double what we had .

dialogue type : s
E :  Uh . And there 's a lot of different meetings at UW

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  uh I mean really m a lot more than we have here right cuz we 're not right on campus ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  so .

dialogue type : h|s
E :  Uh , they seem to have some problems with it . We can we can talk about that later .

dialogue type : fh|s
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  So I mean , we have two speech meetings , one uh network meeting ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  uh Jerry was open to it but I I s

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  One of the things that I think is a little a little bit of a limitation , there is a think when the people are not involved uh in our work , we probably can't do it every week .

dialogue type : s
E :  You know ? I I I I think that that people are gonna feel uh are gonna feel a little bit constrained .

dialogue type : s
E :  Now , it might get a little better if we don't have them do the digits all the time .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  But but we c But I think , you know , we get some scattered things from this and that .

dialogue type : s
E :  And I I d I do think that maybe we can get somewhere with the with the radio .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No , I 'm not talking about ones that are already recorded .

dialogue type : s
E :  I 'm talking about new ones

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because because because we would be asking them to do something different .

dialogue type : s
E :  Right , that 's the found data idea .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  But what I 'm saying is uh if I talk to people that I know who do these th who produce these things we could ask them if they could record an extra channel , let 's say , of a distant mike .

dialogue type : sj
E :  And u I think routinely they would not do this .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , since I 'm interested in the distant mike stuff , I wanna make sure that there is at least that somewhere

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  But if we ask them to do that they might be intrigued enough by the idea that they uh might be e e willing to the I might be able to talk them into it .

dialogue type : s^co.%-
E :  OK . Well I don't why don't we why d u why don't we uh uh turn them turn

dialogue type : s
E :  Turning off the microphone made it crash .

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .
