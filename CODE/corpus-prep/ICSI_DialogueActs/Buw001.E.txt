E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  But th there is this , um There is this class of queries , which are the things that you didn't realize were important at the time

dialogue type : s^df^e:qy
E :  but some in retrospect you think " oh , hang on , didn't we talk about that ? "

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  And that 's kind of what this kind of , uh , complete data capture is kind of nicest for .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Cuz it 's the things that you wouldn't have bothered to make an effort to record but they get recorded .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , I mean And th there 's no way of generating those , u u until we just until they actually occur .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s:qw
E :  But I mean , it 's difficult to sort of say " and if I was gonna ask four questions about this , what would they be ? "

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s
E :  where the microphones are ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and then we could also put in what 's on the board .

dialogue type : s^ar|s

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Well , that 's the interesting thing , though .

dialogue type : s
E :  If we do if we collect four different summaries , you know , we 're gonna get all this weird data about how people perceive things differently .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's like this is not what we meant to research .
