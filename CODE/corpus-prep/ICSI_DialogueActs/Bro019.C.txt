dialogue type : z
C :  Uh , is it the twenty - fourth ?

dialogue type : z
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
C :  We uh we abandoned the lapel

dialogue type : z
C :  because they sort of were not too not too hot , not too cold ,

dialogue type : z
C :  they were you know , they were uh , far enough away that you got more background noise , uh , and uh and so forth

dialogue type : z
C :  but they weren't so close that they got quite the you know , the really good No , th

dialogue type : z
C : 

dialogue type : z
C :  Wait a minute .

dialogue type : z
C :  I 'm saying that wrong .

dialogue type : z
C :  They were not so far away that they were really good representative distant mikes ,

dialogue type : z
C :  but on the other hand they were not so close that they got rid of all the interference .

dialogue type : z
C :  So it was no didn't seem to be a good point to them .

dialogue type : z
C :  On the other hand if you only had to have one mike in some ways you could argue the lapel was a good choice ,

dialogue type : z
C :  precisely because it 's in the middle .

dialogue type : z
C :  There 's uh , some kinds of junk that you get with these things that you don't get with the lapel

dialogue type : z
C :  uh , little mouth clicks and breaths and so forth are worse with these than with the lapel ,

dialogue type : z
C :  but

dialogue type : z
C :  given the choice we there seemed to be very strong opinions for uh , getting rid of lapels .

dialogue type : z
C :  So ,

dialogue type : z
C :  And you should do a lot of talking so we get a lot more of your pronunciations .

dialogue type : z
C :  no , they don't don't have a have any Indian pronunciations .

dialogue type : z
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
C :  Session R

dialogue type : z
C :  R - nineteen .

dialogue type : z
C :  If you say so .

dialogue type : fg
C :  O K .

dialogue type : qy^rt^t
C :  Do we have anything like an agenda ?

dialogue type : qw
C :  What 's going on ?

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  I guess

dialogue type : fh
C :  um .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
C :  Sunil 's here for the summer ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  right .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^t
C :  so , one thing is to talk about a kick off meeting

dialogue type : s^am^e
C :  maybe

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^t
C :  and then just uh , I guess uh , progress reports individually , and then uh , plans for where we go between now and then , pretty much .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : qw^co
C :  Why don't you start with that ?

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : qw^cs
C :  How about an email that points to the FAQ ,

dialogue type : qy^f
C :  you know what I 'm saying ?

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So as I understand , you know , he 's using all the machines and you 're using all the machines ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  I remember I I forget whether it was when the Rutgers or or Hopkins workshop ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I remember one of the workshops I was at there were everybody was real excited cuz they got twenty - five machines

dialogue type : s
C :  and there was some kind of P - make like thing that sit sent things out .

dialogue type : s
C :  So all twenty - five people were sending things to all twenty - five machines

dialogue type : s
C :  and and things were a lot less efficient than if you 'd just use your own machine .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  as I recall ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  but .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d|qrr.%--
C :  So " run command " doesn't use P - make , or ?

dialogue type : qw
C :  So why would one use that rather than P - make ?

dialogue type : qy
C :  Now , does it have the same sort of behavior as P - make ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|qw.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I remember always used to be an issue , maybe it 's not anymore , that if you if something required if your machine required somebody hitting a key in order to evict things that are on it so you could work ,

dialogue type : qw^d^rt
C :  but if you were logged into it from home ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and you weren't hitting any keys ? cuz you were , home ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  We can ask him sometime .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  You probably wouldn't ordinarily , though .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
C :  Yeah . Right ?

dialogue type : s^r
C :  You probably wouldn't ordinarily .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  you 're at home and you 're trying to log in ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and it takes forever to even log you in ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and you probably go , " screw this " ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  and You know .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
C :  OK .

dialogue type : qw^cs.%--
C :  Well , why don't we uh ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : qw^cs^tc
C :  Sunil since you 're haven't haven't been at one of these yet , why don't yo you tell us what 's what 's up with you ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Wh - what you 've been up to , hopefully .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^br^cs
C :  Uh , can you back up a second ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I I I missed something ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I guess my mind wandered .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Ad - ad When you added the on - line normalization and so forth , uh , uh things got better again ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  or is it ?

dialogue type : qy^bu
C :  Did it not ?

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No , no .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  With a different time constant .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  No you didn't ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  G I guess the issue is that people do that anyway ,

dialogue type : s
C :  everybody does that ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and they wanted to see , given that you 're doing that , what what are the best features that you should use .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean clearly they 're interact .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I don't know that I entirely agree with it .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  But but it might be uh In some ways it might be better t to rather than giving the endpoints , to have a standard that everybody uses and then interacts with .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , you know . It 's it 's still someth reasonable .

dialogue type : s
C :  So it should make the spectral subtraction style things work even better ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because you don't have the mistakes in it .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  So it 's g it 's gonna be harder to beat that actually .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  No , that 's that 's that 's a good good update .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
C :  S

dialogue type : s
C :  So you s you So you said one thing I want to jump on for a second .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So so now you 're you 're getting tuned into the repository thing that he has here

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  and so we we 'll have a single place where the stuff is .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Cool .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^co^tc
C :  so maybe uh , just briefly , you could remind us about the related experiments .

dialogue type : s^bu^df
C :  Cuz you did some stuff that you talked about last week ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  I guess ?

dialogue type : fh|s^e.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bu^no
C :  I I don't know whether it was system one or system two ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  So I let me let me just stop you there .

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  But that 's what I mean .

dialogue type : fh
C :  But u u

dialogue type : s^fa
C :  Sorry ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  yeah , I 'm not being I 'm not being clear .

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
C :  What I meant was you had something like cepstra or something , right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  And so one difference is that , I guess you were taking spectra .

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  But you got some sort of different result .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  So I 'm trying to understand it .

dialogue type : fh
C :  But uh ,

dialogue type : %
C :  I th

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  So it sounds like you should look at some tables of results or something

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  and see where i where the where they were different and what we can learn from it .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  But are they changing the weighting ?

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't understand that .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I guess I I haven't been part of the discussion ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so , um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  it seems to me that the well - matched condition is gonna be unusual ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  in this case .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  Unusual .

dialogue type : s^df^rt
C :  Because , um , you don't actually have good matches ordinarily for what any @ @ particular person 's car is like ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  or

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  It seems like something like the middle one is is more natural .

dialogue type : s^no.%--
C :  So I don't know why the well - matched is

dialogue type : %
C : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  The well wa matched has mismatch ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  So remind me of what well - matched meant ?

dialogue type : s
C :  You 've told me many times .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , I mean ,

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  yeah , unless they deliberately chose it to be different , which they didn't because they want it to be well - matched ,

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : h|s^na
C :  Uh , it 's not guaranteed .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s:s^bk
C :  So it 's sort of i i it 's sort of saying OK ,

dialogue type : s:s
C :  so you much as you train your dictation machine for talking into your computer , um , you you have a car ,

dialogue type : s:s
C :  and so you drive it around a bunch and and record noise conditions , or something ,

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  and then I don't think that 's very realistic ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  I mean I th

dialogue type : fh
C :  I I you know ,

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  I I you know ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I guess they 're saying that if you were a company that was selling the stuff commercially , that you would have a bunch of people driving around in a bunch of cars ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and and you would have something that was roughly similar

dialogue type : s^am
C :  and maybe that 's the argument ,

dialogue type : s^ng
C :  but I 'm not sure I buy it ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  So

dialogue type : qw^tc
C :  What else is going on ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Well , the other thing would be to combine what you 're doing .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I mean maybe one or one or the other of the things that you 're doing would benefit from the other happening first .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
C :  Right ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so he 's doing a signal subspace thing ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  maybe it would work better if you 'd already done some simple spectral subtraction ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  or maybe vi maybe the other way around ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  you know ?

dialogue type : qw.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I I guess I 'm ignorant about this ,

dialogue type : qw.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qw
C :  I mean , since Wiener filter also assumes that you 're that you 're adding together the two signals , how is how is that differ from signal subspace ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , oh , OK

dialogue type : s
C :  so the difference is the KL .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see .

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  So essentially you could do simple spectral subtraction , followed by a KL transform , followed by a

dialogue type : s^e^m^na
C :  Wiener filter .

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  that 's right

dialogue type : s
C :  you don't wanna othorg orthogonalize if the things are noisy .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Actually .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um , that was something that uh , Herve and I were talking about with um , the multi - band stuff ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  that if you 're converting things to from uh , bands , groups of bands into cepstral coef you know , local sort of local cepstral coefficients that it 's not that great to do it if it 's noisy .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  so .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  So you should do spectral subtraction and then add noise .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I was only half kidding .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , that sort of what J JRASTA does , in a way .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  If you look at what JRASTA doing essentially i i it 's equivalent to sort of adding a little adding a little noise ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  in order to get rid of the effects of noise .

dialogue type : fh
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  Who is doing this ?

dialogue type : qw
C :  Who 's the guy in Grenada ?

dialogue type : s
C :  I don't know him .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , so at any rate , you 're looking general , uh , standing back from it , looking at ways to combine one form or another of uh , noise removal , uh , with with these other things we have ,

dialogue type : fh|s^ba
C :  uh , looks like a worthy thing to to do here .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Well one of the seems like one of the things to go through next week when Hari 's here ,

dialogue type : s^df
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  or I guess not next week ,

dialogue type : s^bsc
C :  week and a half ,

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
C :  uh , will be sort of go through these alternatives ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  what we 've seen so far ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  and come up with some game plans .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
C :  You know .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  he Here are some alternate visions .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  I mean one would be , you look at a few things very quickly ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  you pick on something that looks like it 's promising

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and then everybody works really hard on the same different aspects of the same thing .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Another thing would be to have t to to pick two pol two plausible things ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and and you know , have t sort of two working things for a while until we figure out what 's better ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  and then ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  you know ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  but , w um ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  uh , he 'll have some ideas on that too .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  there Somebody 's generating Wall Street Journal with additive artificially added noise or something ?

dialogue type : s^e.%--
C :  Sort of a sort of like what they did with TI - digits , and ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : fg
C :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^2
C :  Mis - Mississippi State maybe ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  Yeah , so that 'll be a little little task in itself .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah , it 's true for the additive noise , y artificially added noise we 've always used small vocabulary too .

dialogue type : s
C :  But for n there 's been noisy speech this larv large vocabulary that we 've worked with in Broadcast News .

dialogue type : s
C :  So we we did the Broadcast News evaluation

dialogue type : s
C :  and some of the focus conditions were noisy

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  But we but we didn't do spectral subtraction .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^g
C :  We were doing our funny stuff , right ?

dialogue type : s^df
C :  We were doing multi multi uh , multi - stream and and so forth .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  But it , you know , we di stuff we did helped .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I mean it , did something .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  now we have this um , meeting data .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  You know , like the stuff we 're recording right now ,

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  and uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  that we have uh , for the uh , the quote - unquote noisy data there is just noisy and reverberant actually .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  It 's the far field mike .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And uh , we have uh , the digits that we do at the end of these things .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  And that 's what most o

dialogue type : s
C :  again , most of our work has been done with that ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  with with uh , connected digits .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  but uh , we have recognition now with some of the continuous speech ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  large vocabulary continuous speech , using Switchboard uh , Switchboard recognizer ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  no training , from this ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  just just plain using the Switchboard .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  That 's that 's what we 're doing ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Now there are some adaptation though ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  that that uh , Andreas has been playing with ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  but we 're hop

dialogue type : s
C :  uh , actually uh , Dave and I were just talking earlier today about maybe at some point not that distant future , trying some of the techniques that we 've talked about on , uh , some of the large vocabulary data .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , I guess no one had done yet done test one on the distant mike using uh , the SRI recognizer

dialogue type : fh
C :  and , uh ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^df^j
C :  cuz everybody 's scared .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  You 'll see a little smoke coming up from the the CPU or something trying to trying to do it ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  but

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  But , you 're right

dialogue type : s^df^na.%--
C :  that that that 's a real good point , that uh , we we don't know yeah , uh , I mean , what if any of these ta

dialogue type : s
C :  I guess that 's why they 're pushing that in the uh in the evaluation .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  But um ,

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Good .

dialogue type : fh
C :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt^tc
C :  Anything else going on ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  at you guys ' end ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  So maybe You probably need to back up a bit

dialogue type : s^df.%--
C :  seeing as how Sunil ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I I I really wonder though .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean we 've had these discussions before ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and and one of the things that struck me was that uh , about this line of thought that was particularly interesting to me was that we um whenever you condense things , uh , in an irreversible way , um , you throw away some information .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , that 's mostly viewed on as a good thing , in the way we use it ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because we wanna suppress things that will cause variability for uh particular , uh , phonetic units .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but , you 'll do throw something away .

dialogue type : s:qy
C :  And so the question is , uh , can we figure out if there 's something we 've thrown away that we shouldn't have .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And um .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So ,

dialogue type : s:s^bk
C :  when they were looking at the difference between the filter bank and the FFT that was going into the filter bank , I was thinking " oh , OK ,

dialogue type : s:s
C :  so they 're picking on something

dialogue type : s:s
C :  they 're looking on it to figure out noise , or voice voiced property whatever . "

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  So that that 's interesting .

dialogue type : s
C :  Maybe that helps to drive the the thought process of coming up with the features .

dialogue type : s:qy
C :  But for me sort of the interesting thing was , " well , but is there just something in that difference which is useful ? "

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  So another way of doing it , maybe , would be just to take the FFT uh , power spectrum , and feed it into a neural network ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  and then use it , you know , in combination , or alone , or or whatever

dialogue type : h|s^ar
C :  Uh , no .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No

dialogue type : s^df
C :  the just the same same way we 're using I mean , the same way that we 're using the filter bank .

dialogue type : s
C :  Exact way the same way we 're using the filter bank .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I mean , the filter bank is good for all the reasons that we say it 's good .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  But it 's different .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And , you know , maybe if it 's used in combination , it will get at something that we 're missing .

dialogue type : s
C :  And maybe , you know , using , orth you know , KLT , or uh , um , adding probabilities , I mean , all th all the different ways that we 've been playing with , that we would let the essentially let the neural network determine what is it that 's useful , that we 're missing here .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , that 's probably why y i it would be unlikely to work as well by itself ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but it might help in combination .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  But I I I have to tell you ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I can't remember the conference ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but , uh , I think it 's about ten years ago , I remember going to one of the speech conferences

dialogue type : fh
C :  and and uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I saw within very short distance of one another a couple different posters that showed about the wonders of some auditory inspired front - end or something ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and a couple posters away it was somebody who compared one to uh , just putting in the FFT

dialogue type : s
C :  and the FFT did slightly better .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I mean the i i It 's true there 's lots of variability ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  but again we have these wonderful statistical mechanisms for quantifying that a that variability , and you know , doing something reasonable with it .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  um ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  It - it 's same , you know , argument that 's gone both ways about uh , you know , we have these data driven filters , in LDA ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and on the other hand , if it 's data driven it means it 's driven by things that have lots of variability , and that are necessarily not necessarily gonna be the same in training and test ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  so , in some ways it 's good to have data driven things ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and in some ways it 's bad to have data driven things .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So ,

dialogue type : s
C :  part of what we 're discovering , is ways to combine things that are data driven than are not .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , so anyway , it 's just a thought , that that if we if we had that maybe it 's just a baseline

dialogue type : s^e
C :  uh , which would show us " well , what are we really getting out of the filters " ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  or maybe i i

dialogue type : s^e
C :  probably not by itself ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  but in combination ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  you know , maybe there 's something to be gained from it ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  But , you know , y you 've only worked with us for a short time ,

dialogue type : s
C :  maybe in a year or two you w you will actually come up with the right set of things to extract from this information .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , maybe the neural net and the H M Ms could figure it out quicker than you .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  It 's just a thought .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it 's particularly more relevant now since we 're gonna be given the endpoints .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : qy^bu
C :  Talking cumulants or something ?

dialogue type : s^r
C :  Cumulants or something .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  But No .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  cumulants ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : %--
C :  Or m e

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah , but again You could argue that th that 's exactly what the neural network does .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , it doesn't do it very specifically ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  and

dialogue type : s^e
C :  pretty you know .

dialogue type : fh
C :  But .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : qy^rt^tc
C :  anything on your end you want to talk about ?

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  By by the way , uh , the voiced - unvoiced version of that for instance could tie right in to what Carmen was looking at .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So ,

dialogue type : s
C :  you know , um , if you if a multi - band approach was helpful as as I think it is ,

dialogue type : s
C :  it seems to be helpful for determining voiced - unvoiced ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  that one might be another thing .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Oh no .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^j
C :  So you live in a cardboard box in the street now

dialogue type : qrr
C :  or , no ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt^tc
C :  Suni - i d ' you v did uh did you find a place ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Is that out of the way ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^d.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk^m
C :  Thirty - first ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  They 're available ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and they 'll be able to get you something ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so worst comes to worst we 'll put you up in a hotel for for for a while

dialogue type : s^e.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^j
C :  So a two bedroom cardboard box .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Th - that 's great .

dialogue type : s^ft
C :  Thanks Dave .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : qy^tc.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh , last week you were doing this stuff with Pierre , you were you were mentioning .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Is that that something worth talking about ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  or ?

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's a r root LPC , uh , of some sort .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No , no .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  It 's it 's it 's taking the finding the roots of the LPC polynomial .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  So it 's like line spectral pairs .

dialogue type : s^bu^df
C :  Except I think what they call line spectral pairs they push it towards the unit circle ,

dialogue type : qy^g
C :  don't they ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
C :  to sort of ?

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  But uh , you know .

dialogue type : s
C :  But what we 'd used to do w when I did synthesis at National Semiconductor twenty years ago , the technique we were playing with initially was was taking the LPC polynomial and and uh , finding the roots .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  It wasn't PLP cuz Hynek hadn't invented it yet ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but it was just LPC ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and uh , we found the roots of the polynomial ,

dialogue type : s
C :  And th When you do that , sometimes they 're f they 're what most people call formants ,

dialogue type : s
C :  sometimes they 're not .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So it 's it 's it 's a little ,

dialogue type : s
C :  uh Formant tracking with it can be a little tricky

dialogue type : s^df
C :  cuz you get these funny values in in real speech ,

dialogue type : %-
C :  but .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well you get these complex pairs .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  And it depends on the order that you 're doing ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  but .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  This is from synthetic speech ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  So if it 's from synthetic speech then maybe it 'll be cleaner .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean for real speech in real then what you end up having is , like I say , funny little things that are don't exactly fit your notion of formants all that well .

dialogue type : s
C :  But but mostly they are .

dialogue type : s
C :  Mostly they do .

dialogue type : s
C :  And and what I mean in in what we were doing , which was not so much looking at things , it was OK

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because it was just a question of quantization .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  It was We were doing , uh , stored speech , uh , quantization .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  But but uh , in your case

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^am
C :  I bet it it might have may have been

dialogue type : qy^bu^df
C :  but maybe he didn't have control over it or something ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  So you 're not getting the actual formants per se .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  You 're getting the Again , you 're getting sort of the ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  You 're getting something that is is uh , af strongly affected by the PLP model .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so it 's more psycho - acoustic .

dialogue type : s
C :  So it 's a little It 's It 's It 's sort of sort of a different thing .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  But Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , that 's Somewhere in the synthesizer that was put in ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  But but yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  you view each complex pair as essentially a second - order section ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which has , uh , band center and band width ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  and um ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  But .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  O K .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , uh ,

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  yeah , you 're going back today

dialogue type : s
C :  and then back in a week I guess ,

dialogue type : %--
C :  and .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Great !

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , welcome .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh yeah , digits .

dialogue type : s
C :  I almost forgot that .

dialogue type : s
C :  I almost forgot our daily digits .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Sure .
