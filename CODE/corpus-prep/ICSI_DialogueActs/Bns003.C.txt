dialogue type : s.%--
C :  it is just ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Maybe we can we can , uh , translate the white color into transparent color

dialogue type : s^df
C :  so it will get more natural .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  It 's just a suggestion .

dialogue type : s^2
C :  To the home page .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  That 's that 's OK .

dialogue type : s^bk

C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  No ,

dialogue type : s^aa^r
C :  no , no .

dialogue type : %-
C :  I I just I

dialogue type : s
C :  In fact the Pacific Bell phone was not working , for example

dialogue type : s
C :  when I tried the the phone on this booklet it was not working .

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  But the thing is that maybe this could be on a starting point or or if digest

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  Oh , I 'll be I 'll be here until the end of July .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And , uh ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  well , eh

dialogue type : s^e
C :  even later if , uh , there is some interesting work , uh , going on ,

dialogue type : s
C :  well I I will be able to to do some work from Spain too .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , that 's my future uh forecast .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  Yeah , well , you know , uh the problem the I think that we have a a problem or a difference in Spain , at least , compared with the Americans .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  And i is that our students are , uh are not getting involved in research until they have , uh , finished their studies .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  So , uh , it 's something a little bit , uh , strange

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  but it is this this is the w

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  You you have to to pass the different tests

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  and you have to study the different subjects .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , until you have finished with this , uh well OK , you can do it by by your own ,

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  but but the thing is that you 're not supposed to do it .

dialogue type : s
C :  And usually students are pretty busy for not doing other things .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : h|s^nd
C :  Ah yeah em nnn , not really .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  You know , there is .

dialogue type : s^na^r
C :  There is .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  But , uh , it is not a research work .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Usually it 's an application work .

dialogue type : s
C :  So you build a web site , your own E - commerce site , uh , whatever ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^df
C :  But it is not , uh , something your teacher provides you some research papers and you , let 's say , build a simulator or try to .

dialogue type : fg
C :  So

dialogue type : s^tc
C :  we have , uh , other students are which are , uh , mmm people that has a grant

dialogue type : s
C :  and they are they are starting as , uh , researchers ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  aaa , but this is only connected to your own funding

dialogue type : s
C :  so if you if you have projects you can have , uh , people working with you .

dialogue type : s
C :  If you don't have , a research project well , you cannot pay them

dialogue type : s
C :  so u u usually you don't have anybody .

dialogue type : s
C :  So it 's kind of , uh , dependent on the funding we have in some projects .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So

dialogue type : %
C :  w

dialogue type : s
C :  it 's not sure ,

dialogue type : s
C :  not really sure .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I think we could We could find , uh , some , eh work force .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  Because well , you you can , eh , fo redirect you know , the the work as uh let 's say as a subject work of something that you can you can try to , eh , s

dialogue type : s
C :  In some subjects , in fact , eh , the the the , uh , topics are more open

dialogue type : s
C :  so you can introduce some research topics too .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So

dialogue type : s
C :  but the main thing is that there is a , uh , this big difference

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because , eh , students are not supposed to do research , eh , work until they have finished their gra their grade .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  sure .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
C :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
C :  Yeah , I think so too ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but , eh , you know , it also depends on the subjects

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because sometimes subjects are fixed

dialogue type : s^df
C :  so you cannot you cannot , uh uh , give any any stuff you want .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  You have to to provide a certain a certain prime for the subject too ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but , you know , sometimes , especially in the in the latest , eh uh , courses uh , things are probably more open

dialogue type : s
C :  and , well , it it is something that can be changed .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , they are they are using the the the same idea of labelling packets with a with a content descriptor or something .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  There 's a connection point .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
C :  Later .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  Oh , not really , you know ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  uh , I I I I think that Well , in the future , somebody will come to the NSA group

dialogue type : fh
C :  eh

dialogue type : %
C :  Ah ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fg
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  I I I think that it cannot , eh , be , eh considered the first type task to do

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because nobody is is knowledgeable about multicasting

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  but I think that , eh , any of us could address these things in the future ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  or maybe a new person could address this . in the future .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , wh what I think is that , uh , it it makes no sense to me to reduce , uh , uh , uh , uh , something which is more or less complete ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because we don't have the person .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  I think that the the way to to go is probably the opposite , to try to find something which has a meaning by itself

dialogue type : s^cs
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^fa
C :  Sorry .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  that 's OK .

dialogue type : s^fa
C :  Sorry , sorry ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  heh ?

dialogue type : %-
C :  Now I

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .
