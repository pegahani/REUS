dialogue type : z
B :  Let 's see , I should be

dialogue type : z
B :  Two .

dialogue type : z
B :  La

dialogue type : z
B :  Is this channel one ?

dialogue type : z
B :  Gee , OK .

dialogue type : z
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : z
B :  OK .

dialogue type : z
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
B :  Mm - hmm . What do you do ,

dialogue type : z
B :  you do it higher ?

dialogue type : z
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : z
B :  OK .

dialogue type : z
B :  You wanna close this ,

dialogue type : z
B :  or

dialogue type : s
B :  We 're recording ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  So uh

dialogue type : h|sj^ba
B :  Uh oh that 's a good idea .

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  I shouldn't run the meeting .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  good idea .

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  S sorry I haven't seen the email ,

dialogue type : qw
B :  what was the score ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fg
B :  So

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s^j
B :  so un unsurprisingly Adam is the golden voice ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  you see this here ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Cool .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , we don't even know what that means ,

dialogue type : %-
B :  so I

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah so we 're in better shape than we were say when we did had the ninety - three workshop

dialogue type : s
B :  and we were all getting like seventy percent error on Switchboard .

dialogue type : fh
B :  you know

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
B :  Oh one thing I guess I didn't get

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  so you know the language model was straight from from bigram from Switchboard

dialogue type : qr^bu^d^rt.%-
B :  the acoustic models were also from Switchboard or or

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
B :  So they didn't have anything from this acoustic data in yet ?

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but for Broadcast News when we we played around between the two there wasn't a huge loss .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Good point .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I I I would bet on that too

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz he certainly in that when as a as a burp user he was he was a pretty uh strong one .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Sheep .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Sheep is good .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Have to add PZM and so on

dialogue type : fh
B :  but

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B :  I r

dialogue type : b
B :  Oh

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %-
B :  which I would which well n n n n

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean there 's still just the w the percentages

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  and , I mean they 're not a

dialogue type : s
B :  as we 've talked about before there 's probably overlaps

dialogue type : s
B :  there 's probably overlaps in in uh in fair number in Switchboard as well

dialogue type : fh
B :  so

dialogue type : s
B :  but but there 's other phenomena ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it 's a meeting ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it 's a different thing and there 's lots of stuff to learn with the close talking mikes

dialogue type : fh
B :  but uh

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  yeah certainly I 'd like to see as soon as we could ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I mean maybe get some of the glitches out of the way

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B :  but soon as we could how well it does with say with the P Z Ms or maybe even one of the

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B :  and uh see if it 's , you know

dialogue type : qy
B :  is it a hundred twenty percent

dialogue type : s
B :  or maybe it 's not

dialogue type : s
B :  maybe if with some adaptation you get this down to fifty percent or forty - five percent or something

dialogue type : s
B :  and and then if for the PZM it 's seventy or something like that

dialogue type : s
B :  that 's actually something we could sort of work with a little bit

dialogue type : fh
B :  so

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  well certainly if the recognition as opposed to training ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Seems reasonable .

dialogue type : fg|s^co
B :  Yeah so we just have to go through this process of having people approve the transcriptions ,

dialogue type : s
B :  say it 's OK .

dialogue type : fg|%--
B :  Well we ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  hopefully it will be fairly quick

dialogue type : s
B :  but we get the transcriptions , people approve them and so on

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  it 's just that we 're

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's gonna be a rare thing that there 's a bleep for the most part .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
B :  So you just train just different filters

dialogue type : qy^bu^d.%-
B :  and so you 're just wondering whether the filter is

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : qr
B :  Are you are you using uh uh mel cepstrum or PLP over there ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So probably doesn't matter .

dialogue type : sj^cs
B :  But but it wouldn't hurt to try ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Sure .

dialogue type : fg|%--
B :  No the reason I say this

dialogue type : s
B :  PLP uses uh auto - regressive filtering and uh modeling and so it can be sensitive to the kind of filtering that you 're doing

dialogue type : s
B :  but uh uh mel cepstrum uh might not b you wouldn't expect to be so much

dialogue type : fh
B :  but

dialogue type : s
B :  This is being recorded at forty - eight kilohertz . Which is more that anybody needs

dialogue type : fh
B :  so

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's a digital audio orientation for the board

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  it 's in the monitor so it 's

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  For telephone stuff .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's it 's it 's just that they were operating from Switchboard which was a completely telephone database

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  and so that was a standard for that sixteen s

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  that isn't music and isn't telephone ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  No actually I would think that you would you would get better you 'd get better high frequencies in the local mike .

dialogue type : fh|qh
B :  Uh but who knows ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean we do we we we we we wanna find all this stuff out ,

dialogue type : s
B :  we don't know .

dialogue type : h|s^aa
B :  Uh yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Weren't we gonna do something with a pad at one point ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Well what I was just suggesting is is we have these this cross pad just for this purpose

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and just use that

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  The other thing is eh

dialogue type : s
B :  I don't know if you know this or if it 's a question for the mail to Dan

dialogue type : qr^rt
B :  but is this thing of two eight channel boards a maximum for this setup or could we go to a third board ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  Oh it is one board .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  if it was possible cuz it is i

dialogue type : s
B :  you know already we have a a a group of people in this room that cannot all be miked

dialogue type : s
B :  and it 's not just cuz we haven't been to the store ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  right

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  It might be a hard limitation ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean one thing is it the whole thing as I said is is all structured in terms of forty - eight kilohertz sampling

dialogue type : s
B :  so that pushes requirements up a bit

dialogue type : fh
B :  but

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Yeah at least w we got the good ones .

dialogue type : b.%
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  There isn't this some sort of thing that plugs in ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  you actually have to go and do the soldering yourself ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  No I understand .

dialogue type : s
B :  The reason I ask is these sort of handmade uh wiring jobs fall apart in use

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  so the other thing is to see if we can uh get them to do a custom job and put it together for this .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Well

dialogue type : s^ar|s^ng
B :  no they 'll just charge us more ,

dialogue type : %-
B :  so it 's this

dialogue type : s^arp^co
B :  Not before having one come here and have some people try it out .

dialogue type : s
B :  Because there 's no point in doing that if it 's not gonna be any better .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2^cs
B :  And see if it 's preferable and if it is then we 'll get more .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  We 're in this for the long term ,

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^co^na
B :  Just order it .

dialogue type : h|s^co
B :  Uh we 'll do this off - line , yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^aa
B :  Uh y right

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  so one is for the daisy chain so that 's fifteen instead of sixteen

dialogue type : s
B :  and there 's six on the table

dialogue type : s
B :  so that 's nine .

dialogue type : %
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba^rt
B :  That 's a good idea .

dialogue type : sj
B :  That 's not a dumb question ,

dialogue type : sj^ba^r
B :  it 's a good idea ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  No that no no

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  if we can't get another board and even if we can I have a feeling they 'll be some work .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Let 's figure that we have eight which are set up

dialogue type : s^cs^e.%--
B : 

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  that 's a good idea

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  Kind of rules out overlap

dialogue type : fh
B :  but but uh

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s^ar
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  no it depends on the hand - held

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  but hand many hand - helds are built wi with sort of uh anti - shock sort of things so that it it is less uh susceptible to hand noises .

dialogue type : s
B :  If you hold the lapel mike i you just get all k sorts of junk .

dialogue type : fh
B :  so

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
B :  What ?

dialogue type : s^ar|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  you need a transmitter .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh I see .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Get a get a different radio ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  But you need a ra but it has to correspond to the receiver .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B :  so right ,

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  so this is a good point ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so yeah you have these these mikes with a little antenna on the end

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  You 'll have to check with them ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  But that 's that 's a great idea

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and then just sort of have that as the and then you can have groups of twenty people or whatever

dialogue type : fh
B :  and and uh

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Off you go ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Pretty close ,

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  that 's good .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Super idea .

dialogue type : s
B :  Now you have eight transcribers and there 's ten of us

dialogue type : qw^d
B :  so how do we do this , is the only thing .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So maybe we could they could have a meeting more or less without us that to do this and we should record it

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and then maybe one or two of them could come to one of these meetings and and could you know could tell us about it .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Super .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  but the nine o ' cl nine o ' clock will be i be in here .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : s^aa.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Um good .

dialogue type : fg|qy^cs^d^t^tc
B :  So maybe do digits and recess ?

dialogue type : h|s^aa
B :  Uh OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No I don't think it 's confusing .

dialogue type : fh|s^df^j^rt
B :  Well , it doesn't confuse me .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK .

dialogue type : sj
B :  That 's fine .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  He 's in the he 's in the cour two two five D course .

dialogue type : b
B :  So ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^co^na
B :  let 's do digits .

dialogue type : z
B :  OK .
