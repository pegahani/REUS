dialogue type : z
B :  OK .

dialogue type : z
B :  Thanks .

dialogue type : z
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^ft^t3
B :  Thanks .

dialogue type : b
B :  Huh .

dialogue type : h|s^rt
B :  Um our t I went to talk with uh Mike Jordan this this week

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  um and uh shared with him the ideas about um extending the Larry Saul work

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  and um I asked him some questions about factorial H M

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  so like later down the line when we 've come up with these these feature detectors , how do we how do we uh you know , uh model the time series that that happens

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  um and and we talked a little bit about factorial H M Ms and how um when you 're doing inference or w when you 're doing recognition , there 's like simple Viterbi stuff that you can do for for these H M

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  and the uh the great advantages that um a lot of times the factorial H M Ms don't um don't over - alert the problem

dialogue type : s
B :  there they have a limited number of parameters and they focus directly on on uh the sub - problems at hand

dialogue type : s
B :  so you can imagine um five or so parallel um features um transitioning independently

dialogue type : s
B :  and then at the end you you uh couple these factorial H M Ms with uh with uh undirected links um based on based on some more data .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  So he he seemed he seemed like really interested in in um in this

dialogue type : s
B :  and said said this is this is something very do - able and can learn a lot

dialogue type : fh
B :  and um

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  yeah , I 've just been continue reading um about certain things .

dialogue type : fh
B :  um

dialogue type : s
B :  thinking of maybe using um um m modulation spectrum stuff to um as features um also in the in the sub - bands

dialogue type : s^e
B :  because it seems like the modulation um spectrum tells you a lot about the intelligibility of of certain um words and stuff

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , um .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
B :  Just

dialogue type : s
B :  that 's about it .

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Ha !

dialogue type : s^bk|s^na
B :  Yeah I normally say " O " cuz it 's easier to say .

dialogue type : %-
B :  " O "

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
B :  Oh , no !
