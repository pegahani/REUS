dialogue type : z
B :  Test , um . Test , test , test .

dialogue type : z
B :  Guess that 's me .

dialogue type : z
B :  Yeah . OK .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^t
B :  There 's two sheets of paper in front of us .

dialogue type : qy^d^j^rt
B :  This is the arm wrestling ?

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Oh , good .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Excellent .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's the best thing .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  So , tell me about it .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Yeah . I mean , it 's it 's actually , uh , very similar .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I mean , if you look at databases ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  the , uh , one that has the smallest smaller overall number is actually better on the Finnish and Spanish ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B : 

dialogue type : s^bsc
B :  I mean on the , uh , TI - TI - digits ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh , uh .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , it probably doesn't matter that much either way .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  But , um , when you say u uh , unified do you mean , uh , it 's one piece of software now ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B :  or ?

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
B :  maybe you weren't around when when when Hynek and Guenther and I ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cc
B :  Oh , OK . So Yeah , let 's summarize .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
B :  Um And then if I summarize somebody can tell me if I 'm wrong ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which will also be possibly helpful .

dialogue type : qw
B :  What did I just press here ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I hope this is still working .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  anyway we after coming back from QualComm we had , you know , very strong feedback

dialogue type : s
B :  and , uh , I think it was Hynek and Guenter 's and my opinion also that , um , you know , we sort of spread out to look at a number of different ways of doing noise suppression .

dialogue type : s
B :  But given the limited time , uh , it was sort of time to choose one .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , and so , uh , th the vector Taylor series hadn't really worked out that much .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , the subspace stuff , uh , had not been worked with so much .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , so it sort of came down to spectral subtraction versus Wiener filtering .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , we had a long discussion about how they were the same and how they were d uh , completely different .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And , uh , I mean , fundamentally they 're the same sort of thing

dialogue type : s^df^e
B :  but the math is a little different

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  you know , what 's the ideal filtering ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and depending on how you construct the problem .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And , uh , I guess it 's sort you know , after after that meeting it sort of made more sense to me

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because um , if you 're dealing with power spectra then how are you gonna choose your error ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And typically you 'll do choose something like a variance .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so that means it 'll be something like the square of the power spectra .

dialogue type : s
B :  Whereas when you 're when you 're doing the the , uh , um , looking at it the other way , you 're gonna be dealing with signals

dialogue type : s
B :  and you 're gonna end up looking at power uh , noise power that you 're trying to reduce .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so , eh so there should be a difference of you know , conceptually of of , uh , a factor of two in the exponent .

dialogue type : s
B :  But there 're so many different little factors that you adjust in terms of of , uh , uh , over - subtraction and and and and and so forth ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
B :  um , that arguably , you 're c

dialogue type : s
B :  and and and the choice of do you do you operate on the mel bands or do you operate on the FFT beforehand .

dialogue type : s
B :  There 're so many other choices to make that are are almost well , if not independent , certainly in addition to the choice of whether you , uh , do spectral subtraction or Wiener filtering ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  that , um , @ @ again we sort of felt the gang should just sort of figure out which it is they wanna do

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  and then let 's pick it ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  go forward with it .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that 's that was that was last week .

dialogue type : s^co^j
B :  And and , uh , we said , uh , take a week , go arm wrestle ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  you know ,

dialogue type : s^co
B :  figure it out .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , and th the joke there was that each of them had specialized in one of them .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  so instead they went to Yosemite and bonded , and and they came out with a single single piece of software .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  So it 's another another victory for international collaboration .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Well , that 's fine ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but the thing is the important thing is that there is a piece of software that you that we all will be using now .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Sure .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s^df
B :  w which we sort of were before

dialogue type : s^e
B :  but we were considerably far behind .

dialogue type : s^df^e
B :  And the thing is , this doesn't have neural net in yet for instance .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  You know ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  So it so , um , it 's it it 's not using our full bal bag of tricks , if you will .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , uh , and it it is , uh , very close in performance to the best thing that was there before .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s^e.%--
B :  stationary dealing with e e

dialogue type : s^bc
B :  we didn't explicitly have anything to deal with stationary noise .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  And now we do .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , I gather you have it sounds like you have a few more days of of nailing things down with the software and so on .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  But and then but , um , arguably what we should do is , even though the software can do many things , we should for now pick a set of things ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  th these things I would guess ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  and not change that .

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  And then focus on everything that 's left .

dialogue type : s^cs^t
B :  And I think , you know , that our goal should be by next week , when Hynek comes back , uh , to uh , really just to have a firm path , uh , for the you know , for the time he 's gone ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  of of , uh , what things will be attacked .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  But I would I would I would thought think that what we would wanna do is not futz with this stuff for a while

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because what 'll happen is we 'll change many other things in the system ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and then we 'll probably wanna come back to this and possibly make some other choices .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But , um .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s:qy
B :  Well , one question is , is it on the , um , server side or is it on the terminal side ?

dialogue type : s^df^rt
B :  Uh , if it 's on the server side , it you probably don't have to worry too much about size .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that 's kind of an argument for that .

dialogue type : s
B :  We do still , however , have to consider its latency .

dialogue type : s:qy
B :  So the issue is is , um , for instance , could we have a neural net that only looked at the past ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Um , what we 've done in uh in the past is to use the neural net , uh , to transform , um , all of the features that we use .

dialogue type : s
B :  So this is done early on .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
B : 

dialogue type : s^e
B :  where we 're just kind of creating new if not new speech at least new new FFT 's

dialogue type : s^e
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s^e
B :  uh , that that have some of the noise removed .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , after that we still do a mess of other things to to produce a bunch of features .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  And then those features are not now currently transformed by the neural net .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then the the way that we had it in our proposal - two before , we had the neural net transformed features and we had the untransformed features ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which I guess you you actually did linearly transform with the KLT ,

dialogue type : s^e
B : 

dialogue type : s^e
B :  but but they were not , uh , processed through a neural net .

dialogue type : s
B :  And Stephane 's idea with that , as I recall , was that you 'd have one part of the feature vector that was very discriminant and another part that wasn't ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
B :  uh , which would smooth things a bit for those occasions when , uh , the testing set was quite different than what you 'd trained your discriminant features for .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  So , um , all of that is is , uh still seems like a good idea .

dialogue type : s
B :  The thing is now we know some other constraints .

dialogue type : s
B :  We can't have unlimited amounts of latency .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , y you know , that 's still being debated by the by people in Europe

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but , uh , no matter how they end up there , it 's not going to be unlimited amounts ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so we have to be a little conscious of that .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s
B :  So there 's the neural net issue .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  There 's the VAD issue .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  And , uh , there 's the second stream thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  And I think those that we last time we agreed that those are the three things that have to get , uh , focused on .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , better ones are good .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I guess they still allow two hundred milliseconds on either side or some ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Is that what the deal is ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  With the rank ordering ?

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : qy^bk^bu^d
B :  Oh , this is for the VAD .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  So Yeah , I was just noticing on this that it makes reference to delay .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , the VAD is sort of in in parallel ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  isn't i isn't it ,

dialogue type : s
B :  with with the ? I mean , it isn't additive with the the , uh , LDA and the Wiener filtering , and so forth .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  And there didn't seem to be any , uh , penalty for that ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^r^rt
B :  There didn't seem to be any penalty for making it causal ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , may as well , then .

dialogue type : s
B :  And he says Wiener filter is is forty milliseconds delay .

dialogue type : qy.%-
B :  So is it ?

dialogue type : s^2
B :  The smoothing ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  So that 's that 's really not not bad .

dialogue type : s
B :  So we may in fact we 'll see what they decide . We may in fact have , um , the the , uh , latency time available for to have a neural net .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  I mean , sounds like we probably will .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 'd be good .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Cuz I cuz it certainly always helped us before .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , they 're you know , they 're disputing it .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  You know , they 're saying , uh one group is saying a hundred and thirty milliseconds and another group is saying two hundred and fifty milliseconds .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Two hundred and fifty is what it was before actually .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , some people are lobbying lobbying to make it shorter .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , it just it when we find that out it might change exactly how we do it , is all .

dialogue type : qw
B :  I mean , how much effort do we put into making it causal ?

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  I mean , I think the neural net will probably do better if it looks at a little bit of the future .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  But , um , it will probably work to some extent to look only at the past .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  And we ha you know , limited machine and human time , and effort .

dialogue type : qw
B :  And , you know , how how much time should we put into into that ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 'd be helpful if we find out from the the standards folks whether , you know , they 're gonna restrict that or not .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s
B :  But I think , you know , at this point our major concern is making the performance better

dialogue type : s
B :  and and , um , if , uh , something has to take a little longer in latency in order to do it that 's you know , a secondary issue .

dialogue type : s
B :  But if we get told otherwise then , you know , we may have to c clamp down a bit more .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  So that 's fixed in this .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , we talked about that .

dialogue type : b
B :  Good .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  So , @ @ I mean , you were doing a lot of changes .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Did you happen to notice how much , uh , the change was due to just this frame - dropping problem ?

dialogue type : qo
B :  What about this ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well . But like we 're saying , if there 's four or five things like that then pretty sho soon you 're talking real improvement .

dialogue type : %
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Oh , that 's a real good point .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  It might be hard if it 's at the server side .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Well , you could .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Yeah . I mean , it it always seemed to us that it would be kind of nice to in addition to , uh , reducing insertions , actually use up less bandwidth .

dialogue type : s
B :  But nobody seems to have cared about that in this evaluation .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it would be more or less the same thing with the neural net , I guess , actually .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , uh ,

dialogue type : qw.%--
B :  what 's , uh ?

dialogue type : s^ba.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah . I was wondering about that .

dialogue type : s
B :  That was I I had written that down there .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Hmm . Yeah . Well , it 's not surprising it 'd be worse the first time .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But , um ,

dialogue type : s^ba^cs
B :  it does seem like , you know , i i i i some compromise between always depending on the first fifteen frames and a a always depending on a a pause is is is a good idea .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Uh , maybe you have to weight the estimate from the first - teen fifteen frames more heavily than than was done in your first attempt .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : qy
B :  do you have any way of assessing how well or how poorly the noise estimation is currently doing ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So that 's something you could do with , um , this final system .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Just do this everything that is in this final system except , uh , use the channel zero .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  And then see how much better it gets .

dialogue type : s^ba.%--
B :  If it 's , you know , essentially not better , then it 's probably not worth

dialogue type : s^e
B :  any more .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : s^2^na
B :  Not using these methods anyway . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap|s.%--
B :  Well , yeah . And and also there 's just the fact that , um ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  eh , uh , although we 're trying to do very well on this evaluation , um , we actually would like to have something that worked well in general .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , you might , you might not .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So , um .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , it 'd certainly be more robust to different kinds of input if you had at least some updates .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But , um .

dialogue type : s^bd
B :  Well , I don't know .

dialogue type : qw
B :  What what do you , uh what do you guys see as as being what you would be doing in the next week , given wha what 's happened ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  This is a different net .

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  You see , the idea is that the , um , initial decision to that that you 're in silence or speech happens pretty quickly .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Yeah . And that 's sort of fed forward , and and you say " well , flush everything , it 's not speech anymore " .

dialogue type : h|s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , it 's only used f Well , it 's used for frame - dropping .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , it 's used for end of utterance

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because , you know , there 's if you have more than five hundred milliseconds of of of nonspeech then you figure it 's end of utterance or something like that .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Yeah . So probably the VAD and and maybe testing out the noise estimation a little bit .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , keeping the same method

dialogue type : s
B :  but but , uh , seeing if you cou but , um noise estimation could be improved .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  Those are sort of related issues .

dialogue type : s
B :  It probably makes sense to move from there .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  And then , uh , later on in the month I think we wanna start including the neural net at the end .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s^tc|qy^d^rt^t^tc
B :  OK . Anything else ?

dialogue type : s^ba^rt
B :  Good .

dialogue type : s^j^rt
B :  Yeah . You didn't didn't fall .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's good .

dialogue type : s^j^rt
B :  Our e our effort would have been devastated

dialogue type : s^e^j
B :  if you guys had run into problems .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , that 's the plan .

dialogue type : s
B :  I guess the week after he 'll be , uh , going back to Europe ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s^ng
B :  No , no . He 's he 's he 's dropped into the US . Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh . So , uh .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , the idea was that , uh , we 'd we 'd sort out where we were going next with this with this work before he , uh , left on this next trip .

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  Good . Uh , Barry , you just got through your quals , so I don't know if you have much to say .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But , uh .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  In conversational speech in particular .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I think you can you can put them in pretty reliably in synthetic speech .

dialogue type : s
B :  But we don't have too much trouble recognizing synthetic speech since we create it in the first place .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s^t^tc
B :  OK . Well , short meeting .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's OK .

dialogue type : s^t
B :  OK . So next week hopefully we 'll can get Hynek here to to join us

dialogue type : fh
B :  and , uh ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh .

dialogue type : s^t
B :  Digits , digits .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  OK , now .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Alright . Let me get my glasses on so I can see them .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : z
B :  Mm
