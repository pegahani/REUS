dialogue type : s^ba
H :  Terrific .

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  Well , since you didn't answer the emai

dialogue type : s
H :  So there was a q question I had asked Adam whether it 's possible to search only for your own name your own utterances ,

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : fh
H :  and Um ,

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s:s^ba

dialogue type : s:s^ba

dialogue type : s^ba^bd

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  Great .

dialogue type : s^ft

dialogue type : s^ba.%-
H :  Uh , it 's really useful , tha

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : s^aa^fe^rt
H :  Yeah !

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  That 's actually Well , it 's useful .

dialogue type : s^ba^bd

dialogue type : b
H :  Right .

H :  We

dialogue type : fg|s:s
H :  Yeah . You can search for " beep " or " bleep " .

dialogue type : s
H :  In somebody else 's turn .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
H :  We 're sort of in a stage where we 're uh , Don 's going through getting some of the next meetings that Jane s has .

dialogue type : s
H :  And , uh , you know , creating a second database .

dialogue type : s
H :  So we haven't actually run anything yet .

dialogue type : s
H :  We need to get a critical mass for that .

dialogue type : s^2
H :  And check the segmentations .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  Great .

dialogue type : qw
H :  A What do you mean , a different pause threshold ?

dialogue type : qy.%-

dialogue type : s

H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na.%-

dialogue type : fg|s^ba

dialogue type : s
H :  The longer is better .

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  There 's there 's th

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  There 's a l there 's a lot of these cases just like now , where I c people say " uh uh " when they 're trying to ta

dialogue type : s^ba.%--
H :  and there 's about a half - second pause to a second in between and then another word ,

dialogue type : s^ba^cs
H :  and it 's much better if we can keep those together , I think .

dialogue type : s
H :  You know , you just fake the format that you take as input with the synch times to a new set of synch times ,

dialogue type : fh
H : 

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
H :  And I have I have like another un - backed I ha have another six gig , which Jeremy , if you 're not using , can on XA .

dialogue type : qo^cs^j
H :  How about during the picnic ?

dialogue type : s^rt
H :  Sorry . Beep .

dialogue type : s^ba^j
H :  You 're really dedicated , if you 're No matter how you parse that one .

dialogue type : s^bu
H :  So that means we can't , um , save meeting data either .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
H :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bu
H :  So it just can't so we can't have two meetings in a row where the first meeting 's during that hour .

dialogue type : s
H :  That 's all I meant .

dialogue type : s
H :  That that 's happening , like , today .

dialogue type : s^e

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : fh
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  Well , i it 's an interesting question , because I was thinking " well you can force align the transcriber transcripts , and then of course , you try to merge them in time .

dialogue type : qw
H :  But how do you score ? "

dialogue type : s
H :  I mean it 's just an interesting problem .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
H :  Right . I mean , there 's a whole sort of dis

dialogue type : fg
H :  Right . We Right .

dialogue type : s
H :  But there 's a whole interesting discussion ,

dialogue type : s
H :  cuz of course the alignments are not perfect either ,

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  and so um . In fact , we actually don't have a a p

dialogue type : s
H :  I mean , it it 's worth trying .

dialogue type : %--

dialogue type : b
H :  Right . Right .

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--

dialogue type : s.%--

dialogue type : b
H :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Right . Exactly .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
H : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
H :  Do you assume you know the speaker when you do this ?

dialogue type : s
H :  Well , th r Well , there , there 's only one person who it can be ,

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because they own that microphone .

dialogue type : s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd.%-
H :  No - It 's not a pro

dialogue type : s^ar|s^cs
H :  No . You can run both .

dialogue type : s.%--
H :  And you can s

dialogue type : s
H :  The other thing is that you actually have direction here .

dialogue type : s
H :  So , unlike these corpora that are recorded with other microphones , like The right way to do this I guess , w you know , in the future would be , well , in general , Thilo 's sitting there , and this PZM is gonna You know , he 's roughly in that location .

dialogue type : s
H :  Well , any case where the people are not all sitting at the same place and they 're not moving around too much .

dialogue type : s^ng.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  I mean , that , um , Jane 's i n The pickup of Adam on this mike is gonna be different than me , in terms of energy and so forth over the whole meeting .

dialogue type : s
H :  You might get some clustering from the speaker and some of it from the characteristics of the distance ,

dialogue type : fh
H : 

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Right . Exactly .

dialogue type : s
H :  They 're both picked up in the clustering , I guess .

dialogue type : s^aap^cs
H :  Or to just do the clustering , knowing that you 're capturing both .

dialogue type : s
H :  It 's just that the kind of clustering we 've done before hasn't had that , uh , distance factor , or location factor in it in the same way .

dialogue type : s
H :  And so we 're not really modeling it directly .

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  If somebody does , we sh maybe we add that

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because I think it would be a pretty big difference .

dialogue type : s
H :  When you listen , you can sort of tell where people are ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
H :  not which s you know , side ,

dialogue type : %--
H : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
H :  Right . Even with one microphone .

dialogue type : fg|s
H :  Right . So our our clustering is not gonna be intelligent that way .

dialogue type : s
H : 

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  OK .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^fa
H :  F Sorry .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
H :  For these meetings ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
H :  Right . They 're somewhere in between January and late March , or something like that ?

dialogue type : %--
H :  N

dialogue type : %-
H :  N

dialogue type : s^nd.%-
H : 

dialogue type : fg|s
H :  Yeah . We haven't a modified the recognizer at all .

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  So , actually , um , at some point we should update and rescore everything with , you know , the corrected transcripts ,

dialogue type : %--
H :  just to h

dialogue type : s^rt
H :  Sometimes the changes are , um , cases where the recognizer would get it wrong anyway ,

dialogue type : s^df
H :  cuz it was some word that we didn't have in the vocabulary ,

dialogue type : %--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  But it does help to get the backchannels back in , and things like that .

dialogue type : qy^rt
H :  Would that ? Doesn't that only change the scoring if a word has moved into a different segment ?

dialogue type : s
H :  I mean , I don't think that 's har I hardly ever see that .

dialogue type : s
H :  I think most of them are pretty good .

dialogue type : s^bu
H :  Oh , you mean you would need to re - run the recognition .

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  You know ? It 's it 's probably more fair to re - run the whole th re - run that .

dialogue type : s
H :  Uh , in other words , it 's not really a scoring script problem .

dialogue type : %--
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Y Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s
H :  You It 'll sort of work , but it 's not exactly what you would maybe get from recognition .

dialogue type : s
H :  You never know .

dialogue type : %-
H :  Well , you c You you s

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
H :  Well , it definitely helps with , um , forced alignment , too ,

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because , you know , whe when we know the the the true words and we 're adding them to the vocabulary and training a language model and so forth for future meetings , especially the like , the front - end meetings or meetings with a lot of jargon in them , that is not represented in Switchboard or CallHome , then it then it really helps .

dialogue type : fh
H :  So

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba^df
H :  It I guess it It 's been around for a long time ,

dialogue type : s
H :  and it it 's sort of , um Because it 's so strong a word , people don't take it that seriously ,

dialogue type : s
H :  in It 's not negatively viewed .

dialogue type : s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^df
H :  Actually , Jane is right .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  Like , in conversation analysis , I 've never heard people use this ,

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because they 're not using an automatic system .

dialogue type : s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^aa|%-
H :  Right . I 'm j Well ,

dialogue type : s^df^nd
H :  you can do experiments ,

dialogue type : s
H :  but the it 's cheating relative to what we call a system where we can completely control this black box .

dialogue type : s
H :  And it 's not a very smart system .

dialogue type : s
H :  It it only knows what we give it .

dialogue type : s
H :  And if w If it knows more than we would really give it when it runs , we call it cheating .

dialogue type : %--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  Yeah , it 's f only used in a community that does some type of computational modeling ,

dialogue type : s
H :  I think . It 's really not used in any kind of community doing experiments on human perception ,

dialogue type : %--
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  You know . So she certainly can define it .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
H :  Yeah . I thi I think to the wrong audience , I agree that , um , p

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  to the wrong audie we should just explain what it what it means here , and that it 's a common term ,

dialogue type : %-
H :  and

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
H :  Hmm . The first time I heard that , I I thought , you know , the same thing

dialogue type : s
H :  and I guess you ju after a while it becomes almost a It 's a bu bit of a a humbling thing when somebody says that .

dialogue type : s
H :  If they get good results but we were cheating on this feature because we took it for granted even though we can't really assume that , then it 's actually the opposite .

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  Actually , I think of cheating as a way to do some work , where you can't address all of the computational tasks .

dialogue type : s
H :  Like , if we wanna study , um , speaker habits , but we can't do speaker detection .

dialogue type : s
H :  But we wanna assume Let 's say , we know this is Jane and we know this is Chuck ,

dialogue type : s
H :  even though automatically to look at the habits , we would need to also first figure that out .

dialogue type : s
H :  But we can sort of cheat on that factor

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because it 's somebody else 's research .

dialogue type : s.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
H :  Right . Eh or w But we really can't work on that problem .

dialogue type : s
H :  We don't have time ,

dialogue type : s
H : 

dialogue type : s
H :  And so you you assume it 's given

dialogue type : s^df
H :  because it 's , um you wanna go forward with your research , and assume that you have that information .

dialogue type : fh
H :  So ,

dialogue type : s
H :  I guess if I don't ever think of it as negative . More like , it 's something we 're not building .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
H :  I I think that 's a really good idea .

dialogue type : s^df
H :  Because for all kinds of studies , we don't really enjoy meetings where some of the where the signal 's going off at times .

dialogue type : s
H :  It just makes it hard to study any kind of parameters .

dialogue type : fh
H :  So ,

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  if there 's a way to check the signal quality before transcribing it and you find any problem at all , it 'd be much better to go to another meeting , I think .

dialogue type : s
H :  I 've already written some notes here ,

dialogue type : %--
H : 

dialogue type : b
H : 

dialogue type : b
H :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
H :  But it 's my ear .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
H :  I 'm sure it 's something wrong with my head ,

dialogue type : fh
H : 

dialogue type : qy
H :  Um , actually , is there a way , though , to use whatever you 're using for background noise to check post hoc that a microphone was constantly on ?

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : %-
H :  Uh , like this o

dialogue type : qw
H :  But then how are y how are you detecting during a meeting ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
H :  But is it better than nothing ?

dialogue type : s.%-
H : 

dialogue type : s^bk
H :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
H : 

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  So , you could run that post hoc on a already recorded meeting , in the sense that , you know , not everyone as you just said , you won't be there .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
H : 

dialogue type : s^cs
H :  I really think it 's better not to transcribe a meeting that 's gonna have problems once you 've spent all this effort .

dialogue type : s^aa
H :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
H :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
H :  I 'd mu We 're I 'd much rather have , you know , meetings that have all the channels ,

dialogue type : s^e
H :  even if we had to skip a meeting or something ,

dialogue type : s^df
H :  just for all these other purposes .

dialogue type : fh
H :  So .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|%-
H : 

dialogue type : fg|s
H :  Right . There but there 's a shortage of trans transcription power .

dialogue type : b
H :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy
H :  You know what ?

dialogue type : s
H :  They can their four o ' clock cancelled ,

dialogue type : s
