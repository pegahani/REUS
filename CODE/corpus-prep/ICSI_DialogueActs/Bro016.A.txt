A :  Hello ?

dialogue type : z
A :  Hello ?

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Voicing thing .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  um .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  I just , um , continuing looking at , uh , ph uh , phonetic events ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  and , uh , this Tuesday gonna be , uh , meeting with John Ohala with Chuck to talk some more about these , uh , ph um , phonetic events .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , came up with , uh , a plan of attack ,

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  uh , gonna execute ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  and

dialogue type : fh
A :  um

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's that 's pretty much it .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s^bs
A :  you oh , you want you want details .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  I was hoping I could wave my hands .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  um .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So , once wa

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  I I was thinking getting getting us a set of acoustic events to um , to be able to distinguish between , uh , phones and words and stuff .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  we would figure out a set of these events that can be , you know , um , hand - labeled or or derived , uh , from h the hand - labeled phone targets .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
A :  Um , we could take these events and , um , do some cheating experiments ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
A :  um , where we feed , um , these events into an SRI system , um , eh , and evaluate its performance on a Switchboard task .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Uh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Sure .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um , I I can give you an example of twenty - odd events .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  So , he In this paper , um , it 's talking about phoneme recognition using acoustic events .

dialogue type : s^e^rt
A :  So , things like frication or , uh , nasality .

dialogue type : h
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  this is a paper by Hubener and Cardson Benson Bernds - Berndsen .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Um .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Good . That 's great .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
A :  So .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Using these these events , um , you know , we can we can perform these these , uh , cheating experiments .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  See how how how good they are , um , in , um in terms of phoneme recognition or word recognition .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  and then from that point on , I would , uh , s design robust event detectors , um , in a similar , um , wa spirit that Saul has done w uh , with his graphical models , and this this probabilistic AND - OR model that he uses .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  eh , try to extend it to , um to account for other other phenomena like , um , CMR co - modulation release .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  and maybe also investigate ways to to modify the structure of these models , um , in a data - driven way ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  uh , similar to the way that , uh , Jeff Jeff , uh , Bilmes did his work .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  and while I 'm I 'm doing these , um , event detectors , you know , I can ma mea measure my progress by comparing , um , the error rates in clean and noisy conditions to something like , uh , neural nets .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  so , once we have these these , uh , event detectors , um , we could put them together and and feed the outputs of the event detectors into into the SRI , um , HMM HMM system ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  and ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  and test it on on Switchboard or , um , maybe even Aurora stuff .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And ,

dialogue type : s
A :  that 's pretty much the the big picture of of um , the plan .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .
