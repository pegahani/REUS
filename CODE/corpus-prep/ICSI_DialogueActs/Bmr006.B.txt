dialogue type : z
B :  OK ,

dialogue type : z
B :  now we 're on and it seems to be working .

dialogue type : z
B :  So , I mean

dialogue type : z
B :  I don't know what it is .

dialogue type : z
B :  But all all I know is that it seems like every time I am up here after a meeting , and I start it , it works fine .

dialogue type : z
B :  And if I 'm up here and I start it and we 're all sitting here waiting to have a meeting , it gives me that error message

dialogue type : z
B :  and I have not yet sat down with been able to get that error message in a point where I can sit down and find out where it 's occurring in the code .

dialogue type : z
B :  Yep , we will .

dialogue type : z
B :  One of these days .

dialogue type : z
B :  No .

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  And what 's he interested in , specifically ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Great .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  One offs ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah , we 're we 're hoping that they 'll let us start recording regularly .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , we have a lot of overlap between this meeting and the morning meeting .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , we we 've only had three .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Yeah . Yeah , just talking about .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  We all had the same thought .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Well , I think that , um I think that the only thing we should say in the advertisement is that the meeting should be held in English .

dialogue type : s
B :  And and I think if it 's a pre - existing meeting and it 's held in English , I I think it 's probably OK if a few of the people don't have uh , g particularly good English skills .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Well , not to mention the fact that I would be hesitant certainly to take anyone under eighteen , probably even an anyone under twenty - one .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
B :  What 's that ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Well , age - ist . The " eighteen " is because of the consent form .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  We 'd hafta get find their parent to sign for them .

dialogue type : b
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I think we 'd need a real motivated partner to do that .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  We 'd need to find someone on campus who was interested in this .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , I know that space is really scarce on at least in CS .

dialogue type : s
B :  You know , to to actually find a room that we could use regularly might actually be very difficult .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  That 's true .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  True .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , I think it would be interesting because then we could regularly get another meeting .

dialogue type : s
B :  another type of meeting .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : sj
B :  I think if we if we wanna just record with the tabletop microphones , that 's easy .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's very easy ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but that 's not the corpus that we 're collecting .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  And you don't really need the close microphone , you mean .

dialogue type : b
B :  Ye - Yeah . Yep .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Tape recorder .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2|s^aa
B :  Not enough for others , right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  For some of it .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^2^d^rt
B :  Special ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Here .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , I thought so too .

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  Well , I was thinking , lunch after .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Um , I had a I spoke with some people up at Haas Business School who volunteered .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Should I pursue that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  They they originally They 've decided not to do go into speech .

dialogue type : s
B :  So I 'm not sure whether they 'll still be so willing to volunteer ,

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  but I 'll send an email and ask .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I 'll tell them about the free lunch .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  And they 'll say there 's no such thing .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's alright .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  No , the they they 're very weird .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  The problem with engineers is " beep . "

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Yep . Let them have their meeting .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Mmm . Of the meeting ?

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  It 'd be fun .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  I think it would just be fun , you know , if nothing else , you know .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's a novelty item .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , anyone can have the transcripts . So . I thought we could point that out .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  That 's a good point .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Right , it can't be the internal one .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , that 's true .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK , see you .

dialogue type : s^ar^t3
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Bye .

dialogue type : s
B :  We are slowly slowly getting to the point where we have uh enough sp room to record meetings .

dialogue type : s
B :  So I uh did a bunch of archiving , and still doing a bunch of archiving ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  I I 'm in the midst of doing the P - files from uh , Broadcast News .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and it took eleven hours to do to uh copy it .

dialogue type : s
B :  And it 'll take another eleven to do the clone .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , it 's Abbott .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's Abbott , so it just But it 's it 's a lot of data .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  Tape .

dialogue type : s
B :  I did an archive .

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  So I 'm archiving it , and then I 'm gonna delete the files .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that will give us ten gigabytes of free space .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so one That that will be done , like , in about two hours .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And so uh , at that point we 'll be able to record five more meetings .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , especially because I 'm generating a clone , also .

dialogue type : s
B :  So . And that takes a while .

dialogue type : s
B :  Two copies .

dialogue type : s
B :  One offsite , one onsite .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
B :  No , the the these are the P - files from Broadcast News , which are regeneratable regeneratable

dialogue type : s
B :  um , if we really need to , but we had a lot of them . And for the full , uh , hundred forty hour sets .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so they they were two gigabytes per file and we had six of them or something .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Or maybe six .

dialogue type : s
B :  The SUN , ha uh , takes more disks than the Andatico one did .

dialogue type : s
B :  The SUN rack takes Th - One took four and one took six , or maybe it was eight and twelve . Whatever it was , it was , you know , fifty percent more .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , what happened is that we we bought all our racks and disks from Andatico for years , according to Dave ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and Andatico got bought by another company and doubled their prices .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so , uh , we 're looking into other vendors .

dialogue type : s
B :  " We " By " we " of course I mean Dave .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  SPINE .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  So , so , uh , we have space on the current disk right now , where Meeting Recorder is ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and that 's probably enough for about four meetings .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No , no ,

dialogue type : s
B :  well , it 's wherever the Meeting Recorder currently is .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think it 's DI .

dialogue type : s
B :  I don't remember .

dialogue type : s
B :  Th - I think it 's DC - It 's whatever that one is .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  I just don't remember , it might be DC .

dialogue type : s
B :  And that has enough for about four more meetings right now .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , I mean we were at a hundred percent and then we dropped down to eighty - six for reasons I don't understand .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , someone deleted something somewhere .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so we have some room again .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then with Broadcast News , that 's five or six more meetings ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so , you know , we have a couple weeks .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh , so , yeah , I think I think we 're OK , until we get the new disk .

dialogue type : s
B :  We should put it onto the Broadcast News one .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's probably the best thing to do . And that way we consolidate Meeting Recorder onto one disk rather than spreading them out .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I mean , I can tell you , I just don't know off the top of my head .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  But , so we could ' jus just do that at the end of today , once the archive is complete , and I 've verified it .

dialogue type : s
B :  Cuz that 'll give us plenty of disk .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^t3
B :  I 've seen it already .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Throughout the meeting .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Oh , you did that by hand ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Can I see that ?

dialogue type : qy
B :  Can I get a copy ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes , absolutely .

dialogue type : qr
B :  And so are you planning to do that or have you done that already ?

dialogue type : qr
B :  Have you done that or are you planning to do that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : sj^fe
B :  Darn !

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Yeah , fans .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  So so you intend to hand - mark those and exclude them ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^fe
B :  Whew !

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^t3
B :  I should 've got the digital camera .

dialogue type : s^t3
B :  Oh well .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  Nonspeech .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , training , and validation . Sure .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , but this is what you 're starting with .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  One or two or more .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , yeah , that 's what he was saying before .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , so that 's what he was saying before , is that he excluded those .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  With the fan .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^rt^tc
B :  Right . So Fine . Go on .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  " Tone " , whatever .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Bad .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^arp
B :  But , you know , as a feature , it might be OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , we don't know .

dialogue type : s^t3
B :  Supervised clustering .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw.%-
B :  What sort of classifier ar ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  Unimodal ?

dialogue type : qy^e.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^2
B :  Right , you can't analyse it .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , using something simpler first I think is probably fine .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Decision tree .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  Deltas ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  yeah . So .

dialogue type : x
B :  Context window ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : x
B : 

dialogue type : s^br^fa
B :  I 'm I 'm I 'm sorry , I didn't understand you what you said .

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
B :  What what model ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Features .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  Features ?

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right . Mixed .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , I think that that 's a good way to start .

dialogue type : %-
B :  But .

dialogue type : sj
B :  It would be interesting in itself to see .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Well , I think that would be an interesting result .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Yeah . But it I think it would be interesting to try a couple with both .

dialogue type : s^cs
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Yeah , they 're totally hidden .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Are probably better , yep .

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  Well , if you used the array , rather than the signal from just one .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs^na
B :  Yeah , we hav need to put it on a little turntable ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  But it 's another source of information .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Cross - co cross - correlation .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Subtract them .

dialogue type : x
B :  And you find They get peaks .

dialogue type : s
B :  And if there are multiple people talking , you 'll see two peaks .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  Or or even if , like , if people were sitting right across from each other , you couldn't tell the difference either .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : x
B :  Must do . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  And I think Dan is still working on it .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  So . He actually he wrote me about it a little bit ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  Then they 're much broader .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Yeah , we can do whatever we want .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Whatever you 're interested in .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^2^na
B :  Big micro @ @ arrays .

dialogue type : s
B :  Very finely .

dialogue type : s
B :  Oh , I saw one that was like a hundred microphones , a ten by ten array .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  And they had very precision .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  It was all in software and they and you could pick out an individual beam and listen to it .

dialogue type : sj
B :  It was yeah , it was interesting .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's on my web pages .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  All sorts of interesting things you can do with that ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  I mean , not only can you do microphone arrays , but you can do all sorts of um multi - band as well .

dialogue type : sj
B :  So it 's it would be neat .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  In terms of the research th research , it 's really it 's whatever the person who is doing the research wants to do .

dialogue type : sj
B :  So if if Jose is interested in that , that 's great .

dialogue type : sj
B :  But if if he 's not , that 's great too .

dialogue type : qy^2^d^rt
B :  Catch some tea ?

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s^nd^tc
B :  Well , I had a couple things that I did wanna bring out .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  One is , do we need to sign new these again ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , I I should 've checked with Jane first , but the ch the form has changed .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  So we may wanna have everyone sign the new form .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
B :  Um , I had some things I wanted to talk about with the thresholding stuff I 'm doing .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  But , if we 're in a hurry , we can put that off .

dialogue type : fh|s^t
B :  Um and then also anonymity , how we want to anonymize the data .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  No - well , we don't have to do digits .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  OK , go ahead , Jane .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^cs^nd
B :  We 're we 're just We 're getting enough data now that I 'd sort of like to do it now , before I get overwhelmed with once we decide how to do it

dialogue type : s
B :  going and dealing with it .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
B :  No , because then that would give you a mapping , and you don't wanna have a mapping .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^df^nd.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  We don't we wanna we ha we want the transcript to be " Roger " .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because if we made the the transcript be the tag that we 're using for Roger , someone who had the transcript and the audio would then have a mapping between the anonymized name and the real name , and we wanna avoid that .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Ugh !

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  That 's a good point .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : sj^fe
B :  Ugh !

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^fe^t1
B :  Yeah , shoot !

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^fe^t1
B :  Shoot !

dialogue type : s
B :  I I 'm thinking too much .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  Well , I would sug I I don't wanna change the names in the transcript ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  but that 's because I 'm focused so much on the acoustics instead of on the discourse , and so I think that 's a really good point .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  You 're right , this is going to require more thought .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw^tc
B :  How will we how would the person who 's doing the transcript even know who they 're talking about ?

dialogue type : qy^f^rt
B :  Do you know what I 'm saying ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw
B :  I mean , so so how is that information gonna get labeled anyway ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I mean , so if I 'm saying in a meeting , " oh and Bob , by the way , wanted wanted to do so - and - so " ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Yeah , @ @ they 're just gonna write " Bob " .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  And so . If you 're if you 're doing discourse analysis ,

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , really .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , the current one they don't do speaker identity .

dialogue type : s
B :  because in NaturallySpeaking , or , excuse me , in ViaVoice , it 's only one person .

dialogue type : s
B :  and so in their current conventions there are no multiple speaker conventions .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bc^na
B :  y Yu - Ching .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah we we can probably regenerate it pretty easily from the close - talking mikes .

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  So . But I mean that doesn't This doesn't answer the the question .

dialogue type : s
B :  The p It 's a good point , " which what do you do for discourse tracking ? "

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  For for acoustics you don't but for discourse you do .

dialogue type : s
B :  Ugh , that 's a problem .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  if you wanted to anonymize .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^fe
B :  Yeah , darn !

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I mean , what I was gonna say is that the other option is that we could bleep out the names .

dialogue type : s
B :  but then , again that kills your discourse analysis .

dialogue type : x
B :  Ugh !

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  Well , but that but that as I said , that that that works great for the acoustics , but it it hurts you a lot for trying to do discourse .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because you don't have a map of who 's talking versus their name that they 're being referred to .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Someone who 's doing discourse would wanna do that .

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  And that violates our privacy .

dialogue type : s^na^r
B :  And that violates our privacy issue .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  Making some decisions ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  For the public one .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  You know , what we could do also is have more than one version of release .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  One that 's public and one one that requires licensing .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  And so the licensed one would w we could it would be a sticky limitation .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Well , we can talk about that later .

dialogue type : s^arp
B :  Well , depending on how much editing we do , you might be able to still have it useful .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  because for discourse you don't need the audio .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So you could bleep out the names in the audio .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and use the anonymized one through the transcript .

dialogue type : s^aap^df
B :  But , n excuse me , but you could bleep out just the names .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs^df
B :  But in the transcript , you could say , everywhere they said " Jose " that you could replace it with " speaker - seven " .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then it wouldn't meet match the audio anymore .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  Yeah , OK , good point .

dialogue type : s
