dialogue type : z
F :  Yeah , that 's right !

dialogue type : z
F :  Thanks .

dialogue type : z
F :  So .

dialogue type : z
F :  There 's a switch on top .

dialogue type : z
F :  So .

dialogue type : z
F :  " On - off " .

dialogue type : z
F :  The the wireless ones are actually labeled .

dialogue type : z
F :  They have a little piece of tape .

dialogue type : z
F :  That 's r exactly the problem .

dialogue type : z
F :  Subtract one from the mike number to get the channel number .

dialogue type : z
F :  Or maybe add one .

dialogue type : z
F :  Of course .

dialogue type : z
F :  So I guess I am channel eight .

dialogue type : z
F :  You look ni You look nine .

dialogue type : z
F :  Funny , you don't look a day over seven .

dialogue type : z
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : z
F :  so it 's r it 's remarkable how quickly people forget .

dialogue type : z
F :  So far , e

dialogue type : z
F :  You h you must have much better ear .

dialogue type : z
F :  And so far every meeting I 've recorded someone has at one point or another said , " Oh , I probably shouldn't have said that . "

dialogue type : z
F : 

dialogue type : z
F :  Well , I I bet they 're recorded

dialogue type : z
F :  quite loudly .

dialogue type : z
F : 

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's a nice user interface , Dan .

dialogue type : qw
F :  what does " solo " mean ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Ah !

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh ,

dialogue type : qy^d
F :  but it doesn't actually do anything else ?

dialogue type : %
F :  Oh , yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I think a lot o a lot of us ended up wearing it around your neck and then facing up .

dialogue type : fh|s^df
F :  I kn and , uh , just because there doesn't seem to be a good way to mount it .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  This this thing ?

dialogue type : qrr
F :  Or or just that one ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  But this is very comfortable .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , I I could wear this without any difficulty .

dialogue type : %
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  We c we 'd we 'd have to buy new ones .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  The the other wa

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  the other way I had it , which might work , is you put one over an ear

dialogue type : s
F :  and then you can adjust the other one .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  That doesn't work for you ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  So so you see how Jane 's wearing it ?

dialogue type : s
F :  That seems to work OK too .

dialogue type : s
F :  And you just have to bring it up .

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  Well , except you can bring it quite a bit closer to your mouth .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
F :  Yeah , we maybe we should look into if we can buy a replacement .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  If they 're eighty bucks , that might be worth doing cuz they 're very uncomfortable .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Well , I mean , what you 'd rather do is nothing at all ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  of course ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but to get to get a good quality I mean , if if you were listening to it downstairs , that one 's quite a bit lower quality .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
F :  Well well try this one on .

dialogue type : z
F :  I

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , I guess my feeling is that this is for collecting a corpus not for an actual end - user application .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  And so I think a little bit of intrusion is not ridiculous .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  I agree .

dialogue type : s
F :  Training s Training speech recognition systems .

dialogue type : s
F :  We wanna do both .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  So so the the point is that if you if we try , from the get go , to do it off the PZM , we won't get anything .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  You won't be able to align .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  You won't be able to segment .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  You won't be able to do anything .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right !

dialogue type : h|s
F :  Well , I mean , we haven't done the the detail experiment

dialogue type : s
F :  but just from listening to it , it 's pretty bad ,

dialogue type : s
F :  whereas these are m are very good .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean , that 's why That 's why if you if you use DragonDictate or or ViaVoice , or any of those others to do dictation you need to use these .

dialogue type : s
F :  There 's just no other way around it .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I find this one is no problem at all .

dialogue type : s
F :  The only thing is a little bit of audio a a little bit of audio degradation in one ear ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and I get a little bit of peripheral vision ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  but other than that , it 's not bad at all .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Those , on the other hand , are very uncomfortable .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^j
F :  you know , maybe the problem is we got the kid 's version .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's wired .

dialogue type : s
F :  Whereas I used speech recognition for about four years using one of these ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so I 'm used to this .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  I don't use it anymore .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Uh , my hands got better

dialogue type : s^df
F :  so I stopped using it .

dialogue type : fh
F :  But , uh .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , for about four years I used DragonDictate and NaturallySpeaking

dialogue type : s^e
F :  to do all my work .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  It was really a pain .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but I didn't have a choice .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean , I couldn't type .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So ,

dialogue type : %
F :  uh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  In fact , when I first came back to grad school that was a project I wanted to work on ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  " voice environments for programmers " ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but we couldn't get any funding for it and my hands got better .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So

dialogue type : s
F :  that 's how I ended up working on this project instead .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Anyway .

dialogue type : qw^rt
F :  So so what are you guys doing ?

dialogue type : qw
F :  What 's your project ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  Worse acoustics .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  So .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  The PDA one is very , very ambitious .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh , not only does it depend on IRAM taping out and working as specified , it also depends on writing vectorized speech recognition algorithms

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which is non - trivial .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk|%--
F :  Right , I mean ,

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  our back off policy on that if if there 's problems with IRAM is it 'll be a wireless link ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  You 'll dump the the dump the audio wirelessly to a network somewhere

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and you 'll do the recognition .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : h|s
F :  Well , we we we 've had a lot of discussions about it

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  and I think

dialogue type : s
F :  maybe I think t to some extent it comes down to a religious issue .

dialogue type : s
F :  My religion is personal computers are good and terminal mainframes are bad .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so if you can get away with it , I don't want to have a terminal in my hand and a mainframe somewhere else .

dialogue type : fh|s^df
F :  Um , the too many things to cont can go wrong and you lack control .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I think the PC revolution has shown how good it is if you can have the power yourself .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so the IRAM project provided us a method of having a very powerful thing in your hand .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so we wanna see what we can do with it

dialogue type : s
F :  but we 'd also don't want the project to actually completely depend on it .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So ,

dialogue type : s
F :  the project will go forward regardless of whether IRAM works or not .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
F :  So w

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
F :  So a

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so the so for us the Meeting Recorder project has a very similar uh , approach .

dialogue type : s
F :  Me personally , for my P H D thesis , I 'm sorta doing the other way and seeing how much speech recognition can I do on this little unit .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  As I said , the Meeting Recorder project ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so we have people at UW , people here working on robust algorithms that will be running on work stations .

dialogue type : s
F :  They won't be running on IRAM .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then what I 'm trying to do is see how much of it I can put on IRAM .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right ,

dialogue type : s^na
F :  we don't even know what to do with it .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  We don't need to n

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah , we don't even know what to do with their cycles .

dialogue type : %
F :  We w

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  As an example , we had a visitor who was working on speaker ID , acoustic change detection .

dialogue type : s
F :  And he has a very good system for that

dialogue type : s
F :  and and he wants to use this corpus .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^ba^r
F :  What 's nice about getting this corpus is , i with the people wired you have a excellent baseline .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  You have a very easy problem and you can get the right answer , to ground truth very easily

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and then you can degrade it by using the P Z

dialogue type : s^df
F :  you can degrade it further by using those things .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  And and really see what you can do with a real system .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
F :  Oh , really ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  They 're doing an unknown number ?

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's good .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , just mixing it wouldn't work because the channel characteristics are too different .

dialogue type : fh|s^tc
F :  So , uh , what we what we were working on here was parts of Broadcast News .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so that that 's a slightly strange task because they tend to be long segments .

dialogue type : s
F :  But they were they were parts that were interviews that he worked on .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And , uh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yeah , he had he got very good results .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk^r
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , so I I tried his on his system on the Meeting Recorder stuff ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  um ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but of course we don't have any trained neural nets

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  So so his system was based on our hybrid neural net system that we use for speech recognition .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  And so , uh , I was using the Broadcast News nets on this data .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  So of course it didn't do didn't do t tremendously well .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  And then the other problem also was that it doesn't handle overlap very well ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  his algorithm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  That 's right , with all the i interrupts .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  Mixing ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  Like

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  Oh , I 'm sure they do .

dialogue type : s^df^nd
F :  They I 'm sure they have an audio engineer in the back .

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  Well , but that that 's different than an audio engineer fiddling with the mixing parameters .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  High involvement .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  That 's that 's a

dialogue type : s
F :  good way of saying it .

dialogue type : fg|qw^rt
F :  So what do we do ?

dialogue type : s
F :  It seems like there 's a lot of overlap between our projects ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so it would be nice to work together .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  So is your intention to start collecting some meeting data ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  More data is better .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So what would be nice is if we could , uh , converge on on formats and conventions , and so on ,

dialogue type : s^e^m^na
F :  and software .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  I , uh uh It shouldn't be done .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
F :  We 're talking about that right now .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I 'm not sure how much I should say about it .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So that the ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  there 's some possibility that we 're gonna get a third c party company to do the transcription for us in exchange for the corpus .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right ,

dialogue type : %
F : 

dialogue type : s^na
F :  We have a little bit of DARPA .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Uh , under the communicator project .

dialogue type : s
F :  So so that 's part of it .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then , uh , part of it 's on the IRAM group .

dialogue type : s
F :  IRAM group is paying for part of it .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then part of it 's just ICSI general funds , is paying for it as well .

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but they don't expect anything in return .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  They 're just being very nice and good neighbors

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : fh|s^df
F :  and so they they basically wanted stuff anyway .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  And then they just sort of allowed us to direct the audio portion of it to what we needed .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^j:s
F :  And to our listening audience .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  Feedback .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : fg|s^ng
F :  Well i w when I spoke with him he he really just said it was a money issue .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  That it 's certainly not any sort of intellectual property issue where we 're perfectly willing to give people those boxes .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  The boxes are cheap .

dialogue type : fh|qy
F :  Um , but , you know , can they afford to get a six channel Sony wireless

dialogue type : qy
F :  and can they afford the P Z

dialogue type : s
F :  and that sort of stuff .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  this is the same same company that may be doing the transcripts for us ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^r.%--
F :  may be giving us ,

dialogue type : b
F :  uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  And it would also it would be really nice to be able to do it in other rooms ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz otherwise we 're gonna learn a lot about this air conditioning .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  That 'd be great .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  I agree .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  So so are you gonna m uh , i is there gonna be some sort of mark for that ?

dialogue type : qy.%--:s^co.%--
F :  I mean , are they gonna say , " Computer , bring up a web page on "

dialogue type : qrr.%--
F :  or ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^df:s
F :  I 'm just thinking , from a discourse point of view it 'd be very interesting to somehow mark " I 'm talking to the computer " .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s:s^co
F :  " Computer , show me a web page on X , " return .

dialogue type : qy^j^rt
F :  Are you talking to me ?

dialogue type : qy^j^r^rt
F :  Are you talking to me ?

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  XML ,

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  Someone will make some assumption that 's different than someone else .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I I 'm not sure what wh I mean what 's a good solution than that other than trying to keep in touch with each other .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^df^na
F :  I mean , meetings like this are good because we can actually record them .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yep ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  absolutely .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  When you 're talking about your artificial meetings , i they are gonna be goal directed , though .

dialogue type : s:s

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that will be different .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : fg|%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  You 're double miking everyone ,

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
F :  so that 's a close talking and a lapel , and then two environmental mikes ,

dialogue type : qy^g
F :  is that right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|%-
F : 

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  That is , uh .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  or drinking .

dialogue type : s^df^j
F :  Y getting getting coffee on these is definitely a bad thing .

dialogue type : s^t1
F :  Wizard of Oz .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  So a real computer but a w uh , someone driving it .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I I think that 's close enough to what we 're interested in that it would t it 'd be useful for training uh , the acoustic models , without any question .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Oh , absolutely .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df
F :  Yeah , cuz if you don't the the accuracy 's gonna be horrendously bad .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , we 'll definitely need to do both .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  It it really i

dialogue type : s
F :  It will really depend on if we have someone who really wants to do that .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : %-
F :  I

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  just as an example , I I 've done some very simple digits recognitions

dialogue type : s^df
F :  where , uh , I said if I had known we were having this meeting I would have done this before ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Having people read digit strings

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz digits are much easier .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  And just combining just doing multis

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  of course .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  just doing multi - stream on the different mikes helped enormously .

dialogue type : s
F :  And I was a little surprised .

dialogue type : s^bk|%-
F : 

dialogue type : qw^bk^rt
F :  Wh - why ?

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I have no idea .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because they 're a little different .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  And that actually helped .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  That gave several percent improvement .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Absolute .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So that , uh ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  I think just just having stereo will help

dialogue type : s^df^rt
F :  cuz they 're a little different .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  You get a little slightly different estimators

dialogue type : fh
F :  and , uh ,

dialogue type : s
F :  uh , you combine them together , and you do a little better .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : %
F :  M

dialogue type : s
F :  So our initial plan for ICSI was to do forty hours .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then U W is talking about doing an additional sixty to a hundred hours if they have the money .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  If they can actually do it .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean , that 's what they had said before

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but I guess that was more ambitious .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  recording it 's easy .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's transcription that 's a pain .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^co
F :  OK , but you have to put on a You have to put on a mike .

dialogue type : s^bk

F :  Don't switch mikes .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  That 's way too confusing .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  But if you had the data and we had a a company .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I didn't know whether I should name the company that may be providing us transcription or not .

dialogue type : s
F :  IBM .

dialogue type : s
F :  So we 've been we 've been trying we 've been trying to work with them for a while on these projects

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  it 's hard for them to give us money

dialogue type : s
F :  but they they seem to be willing to give us time .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so one of the po potentials is for them to do transcription in exchange for access to the corpus .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  It would be great .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  absolutely .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  I think that would be excellent .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa.%
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s
F :  Morgan says thumbs up .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : fg
F :  So al

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|qw^rt
F :  So so how are you gonna get dra ground truth on that ?

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
F :  But anyway , what I was gonna say is that although we 're not gonna have speech directed to a computer , my expectation is that the acoustic models will be very similar .

dialogue type : s
F :  The language models probably won't be .

dialogue type : s^df^nd
F :  Yeah , I if it 's Wizard of Oz I think it will be .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  The language model will be certainly be different

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  And you 're gonna hand c hand - code that ?

dialogue type : s^bk|%--
F :  Oh , I I uh

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  sure , sure , sure , sure .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  I see .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Right , if you wanna interpret it you uh need to do do that anyway .

dialogue type : qw
F :  So what 's your time frame look like for doing meetings , actually starting to record some ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^df
F :  Well the the reason I 'm asking is that it 's certainly better to get in early with standards , and data formats , and conventions .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Well , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  it 's a it 's ex excellent , excellent .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  that 's right .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , just just just agreeing on a sampling rate and a number of bits , and , uh , header formats and all that .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz ?

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Eh , good good .

dialogue type : qrr^d
F :  Big endian , little endian ?

dialogue type : s|qy^d^g^rt
F :  Well , but that 's that was coincidence , right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fh|s^ar
F :  Well , no

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  that that wouldn't be true .

dialogue type : s
F :  If you 're not gonna transcribe it yourself , then you 're not gonna care too much about our transcription conventions .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  Right of it .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa^j
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So if you and Jane keep keep in touch about transcription conventions , that would be very helpful .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  It 's much more worth while to do if someone else is gonna use it .

dialogue type : s
F :  Although again if this now named company is the one who 's gonna do the transcription , I sus I suspect they have in house tools that they 'll end up using .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's alright .

dialogue type : s
F :  He can talk anyway .

dialogue type : s
F :  I was .

dialogue type : s
F :  LDC is what we were thinking too .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  Robert 's rules .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  There are certainly f formal meeting settings where that 's what 's happens ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  y that you know , Robert 's rules of order and all that .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Uh , so that 's not something we had thought about before

dialogue type : s
F :  but I think it it it certainly is another type of meeting that could be done .

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  Uh , no ,

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  I didn't .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I didn't know we were gonna be recording this meeting ,

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  so I didn't .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes ,

dialogue type : s^na
F :  in the other meetings we have .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  So that 's another thing we should talk about , is making sure that we 're doing it in the same way .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah , if I had known and here we have all these new speakers , I could have gotten lots of digits in

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s^df^nd
F :  No , no , I have people read them .

dialogue type : s:s^j
F :  Seven .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Oh , cool .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Nice falling ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I hadn't thought about that .

dialogue type : s
F :  I hadn't even thought about throwing out the last couple .

dialogue type : s^cs^na
F :  Definitely should .

dialogue type : s^co
F :  Don't throw it away

dialogue type : s^co
F :  but don't use it in your training .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Cool .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  The only thing I don't like about it is that it 's not phonetically very rich ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  that 's right ,

dialogue type : s
F :  TIMIT .

dialogue type : s
F :  So we actually talked about that .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
F :  it 's plenty bad .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  It 's plenty bad just with digits ,

dialogue type : s
F :  although I haven't trained any nets on it .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I 've just been using existing digits or Broadcast News nets

dialogue type : s^e
F :  since we don't have enough data yet .

dialogue type : s
F :  One , seven , eight , two , three , one , three , seven , eight , four .

dialogue type : s
F :  M that sorta thing .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw
F :  But what were they ?

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I I just extracted exactly the same ones ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so .

dialogue type : s
F :  That 's like the TIMIT sentences .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  Greasy wash water ,

dialogue type : b
F :  oh .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
F :  But , so I have a bunch of tools for generating these and for helping transcribe them .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Since you know what you know what the transcript is you don't have to type it in , you just have to segment it .

dialogue type : s
F :  So I have tools for doing that .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Using X - X Waves , Tcl - TK , Perl , and maybe some C programs too .

dialogue type : h|s^ng
F :  Well I I don't have any of the print outs .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I I print them out a a as I need them .

dialogue type : s
F :  So what I should do is just print out a whole stack and leave them up here

dialogue type : s
F :  but I haven't done that .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Well , but i

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's it 's a different task .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's a different task than read .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  You you do it differently if it 's sitting in front of you and you 're reading it than if it 's not .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  I guess we could write them down and then read them ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but .

dialogue type : s
F :  I I we can get digits .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean , a as you said , we don't have to be in a meeting .

dialogue type : s^cs^df
F :  And so if we 're short on digits I can just , you know , capture people in the hallway ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  drag them in here ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  and have them read digits for me .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Well ,

dialogue type : s^df^ng
F :  the the hum we hear right now is actually the projector ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  not the air conditioner .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  The projector is much louder than the air conditioning .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : h|s^ar
F :  Um , no ,

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  not normally ,

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  not for our meetings .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I at least very few of the ones we 've done have we had to do anything on the computer .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right ,

dialogue type : s^df^na
F :  from volume .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's interesting .

dialogue type : s
F :  Although unfortunately , you know , they 're all pretty close ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s^co^fe^j
F :  Oh , look !

dialogue type : s^j
F :  Digit strings .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
F :  Oh no !
