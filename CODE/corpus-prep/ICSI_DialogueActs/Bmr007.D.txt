dialogue type : z
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
D :  We 're on again ?

dialogue type : z
D :  OK .

dialogue type : z
D :  OK

dialogue type : z
D :  OK .

dialogue type : z
D :  OK .

dialogue type : h|s^ng
D :  Uh , we were gonna do that at the end ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  remember ?

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co^df
D :  Just just to be consistent , from here on in at least , that that we 'll do it at the end .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um Well , it ju I mean it might be that someone here has to go ,

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : qy^d^g.%
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  That was that was sort of the point .

dialogue type : fh|s^t^tc
D :  So , uh I had asked actually anybody who had any ideas for an agenda to send it to me and no one did .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right ,

dialogue type : s^t
D :  s OK , so one item for an agenda is uh Jane has some uh uh some research to talk about , research issues .

dialogue type : fh|s^bs
D :  Um and Uh , Adam has some short research issues .

dialogue type : s
D :  Um , I have a list of things that I think were done over the last three months

dialogue type : s
D :  I was supposed to send off , uh and , um I I sent a note about it to uh to Adam and Jane

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  but I think I 'll just run through it also and see if someone thinks it 's inaccurate or uh insufficient .

dialogue type : h|s
D :  Uh , to uh uh , IBM .

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s^cc
D :  Um , So , uh so , I 'll go through that .

dialogue type : fh|qo^d^rt
D :  Um , And , Anything else ? anyone wants to talk about ?

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  No .

dialogue type : fh
D :  OK .

dialogue type : h
D :  Um .

dialogue type : sj
D :  Sort of off - topic I guess .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  I I I can chat with you about that off - line .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's another thing .

dialogue type : fh|qo^d^rt
D :  Um , And , Anything else ?

dialogue type : qo^d
D :  Nothing else ?

dialogue type : fh|s^tc
D :  Uh , there 's a I mean , there is a a , um uh telephone call tomorrow , which will be a conference call that some of us are involved in for uh a possible proposal .

dialogue type : s^co.%-
D : 

dialogue type : h|s^co
D :  Uh Well , we 'll talk talk about that after our meeting .

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Uh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bs^t^tc
D :  So it sounds like the the three main things that we have to talk about are , uh this list , uh Jane and Jane and Adam have some research items , and , other than that , anything , as usual , anything goes beyond that .

dialogue type : s^bk|qh^co^t
D :  OK , uh , Jane , since since you were sort of cut off last time why don't we start with yours ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  make sure we get to it .

dialogue type : qw
D :  What was what 's the the parenthesized stuff that says , like e the first one that says six overlaps and then two point eight ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Ah .

dialogue type : s^j
D :  S so , i it would be statistically incorrect to conclude from this that Adam talked too much or something .

dialogue type : s^aa.%
D :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^t3
D :  Excuse me .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  B I I I rather enjoyed it , but but this

dialogue type : b
D :  Sure .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Oh sure .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , of course th the biggest , um result here , which is one we 've we 've talked about many times and isn't new to us , but which I think would be interesting to show someone who isn't familiar with this is just the sheer number of overlaps .

dialogue type : fh
D :  That that Right ? that that , um

dialogue type : s
D :  here 's a relatively short meeting ,

dialogue type : s
D :  it 's a forty forty plus minute meeting ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and not only were there two hundred and fifteen overlaps but , uh I think there 's one one minute there where there where where there wasn't any overlap ?

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  I mean , it 's uh throughout this thing ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
D :  Oh , so the bottom three did have s stuff going on ?

dialogue type : s^bs
D :  There was speech ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  Oh , about how much is it ?

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  O oh , what 's what 's the what 's the average length ?

dialogue type : qy^d
D :  You don't know ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  OK , you you don you don't have a feeling for roughly how much it is ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Oh , I 'm sure .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
D :  Yeah , but I I 'd u

dialogue type : s^cs.%
D :  go ahead .

dialogue type : %-
D :  I I

dialogue type : %--
D :  I I

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'm I 'm I 'm confused now .

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  So l l let me restate what I thought Andreas was saying and and see .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Let 's say that in in second fifty - seven of one minute , you start talking and I start talking and we ignore each other and keep on talking for six seconds .

dialogue type : s
D :  So we go over So we were we were talking over one another , and it 's just in each case , it 's just sort of one interval .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  So , um we talked over the minute boundary .

dialogue type : qy
D :  Is this considered as one overlap in each of the minutes , the way you have done this .

dialogue type : s
D :  OK , so that 's good , i I think , in the sense that I think Andreas meant the question ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  right ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm ?

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Well , but see , I find it interesting even if it wasn't any more ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because since we were dealing with this full duplex sort of thing in Switchboard where it was just all separated out we just everything was just nice ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm ?

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  Let let m let me rephrase what I 'm saying cuz I don't think I 'm getting it across .

dialogue type : s
D :  What what I what I shouldn't use words like " nice " because maybe that 's too i too imprecise .

dialogue type : s
D :  But what I mean is that , um in Switchboard , despite the many many other problems that we have , one problem that we 're not considering is overlap .

dialogue type : s
D :  And what we 're doing now is , aside from the many other differences in the task , we are considering overlap

dialogue type : s
D :  and one of the reasons that we 're considering it , you know , one of them not all of them , one of them is that w uh at least , you know I 'm very interested in the scenario in which , uh both people talking are pretty much equally audible , and from a single microphone .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so , in that case , it does get mixed in , and it 's pretty hard to jus to just ignore it , to just do processing on one and not on the other .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  That 's an important question to ask .

dialogue type : s
D :  I think what I 'm All I 'm s really saying is that I don't think we were considering that in Switchboard .

dialogue type : qy.%-
D :  Were you ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Were you were you were you were you measuring it ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : fg|s^ng
D :  Yeah , I wasn't saying that .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  I was just saying that w now we 're looking at it .

dialogue type : s
D :  And and and , you you maybe wanted to look at it before but , for these various technical reasons in terms of how the data was you weren't .

dialogue type : s
D :  So that 's why it 's coming to us as new

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Right ? if it 's the null poth hypothesis , and if actually you have as much overlap in a two - person , we don't know the answer to that .

dialogue type : s
D :  The reason we don't know the answer to is cuz it wasn't studied and it wasn't studied because it wasn't set up . Right ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm ?

dialogue type : s^am
D :  May have been .

dialogue type : s^am^r
D :  May have been .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  We do kn we don't know the numbers .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  See , I mean , i i le let me t

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , my point was just if you wanted to say to somebody , " what have we learned about overlaps here ? "

dialogue type : s^co
D :  just never mind comparison with something else ,

dialogue type : s
D :  what we 've learned about is overlaps in this situation , is that the first the first - order thing I would say is that there 's a lot of them .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  In in the sense that i if you said if i i i

dialogue type : s
D :  In a way , I guess what I 'm comparing to is more the common sense notion of how how much people overlap .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Uh you know the fact that when when when , uh , Adam was looking for a stretch of of speech before , that didn't have any overlaps , and he w he was having such a hard time

dialogue type : s
D :  and now I look at this and I go , " well , I can see why he was having such a hard time " .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's happening a lot .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I wasn't saying it wasn't .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  I was commenting about this .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I 'm saying if I I 'm saying if I have this complicated thing in front of me , and we sh which , you know we 're gonna get much more sophisticated about when we get lots more data ,

dialogue type : s
D :  But Then , if I was gonna describe to somebody what did you learn right here , about , you know , the the modest amount of data that was analyzed I 'd say , " Well , the first - order thing was there was a lot of overlaps " .

dialogue type : s
D :  In fact and it 's not just an overlap bunch of overlaps second - order thing is it 's not just a bunch of overlaps in one particular point , but that there 's overlaps , uh throughout the thing .

dialogue type : sj
D :  And that 's interesting .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's all .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Yeah , I wasn't making any statement about that .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah , that would be good to know ,

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
D :  u

dialogue type : s
D :  Actually , I think I 've done it a fair number of times today .

dialogue type : fh
D :  But .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  I have a feeling most of these things are that that are not a benevolent kind are are are , uh um are are competitive as opposed to real really really hostile .

dialogue type : fh
D :  But .

dialogue type : fg|s^j
D :  Uh a vote vote in Florida .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Um , o one thing I I wanted to or you can tell a good joke and then everybody 's laughing and you get a chance to g break in .

dialogue type : fh
D :  But .

dialogue type : fh
D :  But .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um .

dialogue type : s
D :  You know , the other thing I was thinking was that , um these all these interesting questions are , of course , pretty hard to answer with , uh u you know , a small amount of data .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , um I wonder if what you 're saying suggests that we should make a conscious attempt to have , um a a fair number of meetings with , uh a smaller number of people .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean we most of our meetings are uh , meetings currently with say five , six , seven , eight people

dialogue type : qy^cs
D :  Should we really try to have some two - person meetings , or some three - person meetings and re record them just to to to beef up the the statistics on that ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , Liz was raising the question of of whether i it 's the number there 's a relationship between the number of people and the number of overlaps or type of overlaps there ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  and , um If you had two people meeting in this kind of circumstance then you 'd still have the visuals .

dialogue type : s
D :  You wouldn't have that difference also that you have in the say , in Switchboard data .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Uh

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Yeah , acoustic is fine ,

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|qo
D :  But what what do you think about that ?

dialogue type : qy
D :  Do you think that would be useful ?

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'm just thinking that as an action item of whether we should try to record some two - person meetings or something .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Well , OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : fh|s^ng
D :  Uh Well , we 'll have to set up for it .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  Well , we 're not really set up for it to do that .

dialogue type : fh
D :  But .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , we we record this meeting so regularly it wouldn't be that I mean a little strange .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Oh , th that was the other thing ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  weren't we gonna take a picture at the beginning of each of these meetings ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
D :  There 's a head nodding here vigorously , yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  But if you just

dialogue type : s
D :  f But from one picture , I don't know that you really get that .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^cs^t3
D :  You 'd want a video for that , I think .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  Think so ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
D :  Speaking of taking control , you said you had some research to talk about .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  I think so , yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^ng
D :  Yeah , the you know , the reason that he , uh just used silence was not because he thought it was better , it was it was it was the place he was starting .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , he was trying to get something going ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and , uh e e you know , as as as is in your case , if you 're here for only a modest number of months you try to pick a realistic goal ,

dialogue type : s
D :  But his his goal was always to proceed from there to then allow broad category change also .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  One once It 's a I used to work , like , on voiced on voice silence detection , you know , and this is this kind of thing .

dialogue type : s
D :  Um If you have somebody who has some experience with this sort of thing , and they work on it for a couple months , they can come up with something that gets most of the cases fairly easily .

dialogue type : s
D :  Then you say , " OK , I don't just wanna get most of the cases I want it to be really accurate . "

dialogue type : s
D :  Then it gets really hard no matter what you do .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , the p the problem is is that if you say , " Well I I have these other data over here , that I learn things from , either explicit training of neural nets or of Gaussian mixture models or whatever . "

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Uh Suppose you don't use any of those things .

dialogue type : s
D :  You say you have looked for acoustic change .

dialogue type : qw
D :  Well , what does that mean ?

dialogue type : s
D :  That that means you set some thresholds somewhere or something ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
D :  right ?

dialogue type : qw
D :  and and so where do you get your thresholds from ?

dialogue type : s
D :  From something that you looked at .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  So you always have this problem , you 're going to new data

dialogue type : fh|qw
D :  um H how are you going to adapt whatever you can very quickly learn about the new data ? Uh , if it 's gonna be different from old data that you have ?

dialogue type : s
D :  And I think that 's a problem with this .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
D :  But Actually , Andreas may maybe maybe just something simpler but but along the lines of what you 're saying ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I was just realizing , I used to know this guy who used to build , uh um , mike mixers automatic mike mixers where , you know , t in order to able to turn up the gain , you know , uh as much as you can , you you you lower the gain on on the mikes of people who aren't talking ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
D :  right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  And then he had some sort of reasonable way of doing that ,

dialogue type : qw^cs
D :  but uh , what if you were just looking at very simple measures like energy measures but you don't just compare it to some threshold overall but you compare it to the energy in the other microphones .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  Well , it 's probably harder ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I I think what I was s nnn noting just when he when Andreas raised that , was that there 's other information to be gained from looking at all of the microphones and you may not need to look at very sophisticated things ,

dialogue type : s
D :  because if there 's if most of the overlaps you know , this doesn't cover , say , three , but if most of the overlaps , say , are two , if the distribution looks like there 's a couple high ones and and the rest of them are low ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
D :  you know , what I mean ,

dialogue type : s
D :  there 's some information there about their distribution even with very simple measures .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  Wow .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm ?

dialogue type : s^aa.%-
D :  Yeah , I think th

dialogue type : sj^ba^na
D :  I think it 's a great idea .

dialogue type : b
D :  W Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^na
D :  Blindfolds would be good .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Probably we should wait until after Adam 's set up the mikes ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  But .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^co^j
D :  that 's that 's that 's the one that we videotape .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s^co^tc
D :  Um , I I wanna move this along .

dialogue type : fh|s^t
D :  Uh I did have this other agenda item which is , uh @ @ it 's uh a list which I sent to uh a couple folks , but um I wanted to get broader input on it ,

dialogue type : s
D :  So this is the things that I think we did in the last three months

dialogue type : s^e
D :  obviously not everything we did but but sort of highlights that I can can tell s some outside person , you know , what what were you actually working on .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um in no particular order uh , one , uh , ten more hours of meeting r meetings recorded , something like that , you know from from , uh three months ago .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Uh XML formats and other transcription aspects sorted out and uh sent to IBM .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um , pilot data put together and sent to IBM for transcription ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  uh next batch of recorded data put together on the CD - ROMs for shipment to IBM ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  But yeah , that 's why I phrased it that way , yeah OK .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um human subjects approval on campus , uh and release forms worked out

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  so the meeting participants have a chance to request audio pixelization of selected parts of the spee their speech .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  Um audio pixelization software written and tested .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um preliminary analysis of overlaps in the pilot data we have transcribed ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and exploratory analysis of long - distance inferences for topic coherence , that was I was wasn't sure if those were the right way that was the right way to describe that because of that little exercise that that you and and Lokendra did .

dialogue type : s
D :  I well , I I 'm probably saying this wrong , but what I said was exploratory analysis of long - distance inferences for topic coherence .

dialogue type : s
D :  Something like that .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um so , uh I a lot of that was from , you know , what what what you two were doing

dialogue type : s
D :  so I I sent it to you ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  and you know , please mail me , you know , the corrections or suggestions for changing

dialogue type : s
D :  I I don't want to make this twice it 's length but but you know , just im improve it .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk^m.%-
D :  " Bunch of stuff for s "

dialogue type : s^co
D :  OK , maybe maybe send me a sentence that 's a little thought through about that .

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  " Bunch of stuff " , yeah , " stuff " is probably bad too ,

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah , well .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  " range of things " , yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um and and you know , I sort of threw in what you did with what Jane did on in under the , uh uh preliminary analysis of overlaps .

dialogue type : fh|qy^co^rt^t^tc
D :  Uh uh Thilo , can you tell us about all the work you 've done on this project in the last , uh last three months ?

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : h|s
D :  Uh , audio pix wh he did it ,

dialogue type : qw^co
D :  so why don't you explain it quickly ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  We we we spent a a a fair amount of time early on just talk dealing with this issue about op w e e we realized , " well , people are speaking in an impromptu way and they might say something that would embarrass them or others later " , and , how do you get around that

dialogue type : s
D :  so in the consent form it says , well you we will look at the transcripts later and if there 's something that you 're unhappy with , yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  But you don't want to just totally excise it

dialogue type : %--
D :  because

dialogue type : fh
D :  um

dialogue type : s
D :  uh , well you have to be careful about excising it , how how you excise it

dialogue type : s^e
D :  keeping the timing right and so forth

dialogue type : s^e
D :  so that at the moment tho th the idea we 're running with is is h putting the beep over it .

dialogue type : fg|s^bu
D :  Yeah , that I mean , he 's he 's removing the old thing

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Ke - keep a back door .

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^co^rt^t^tc
D :  Alright , so , uh I think we should , uh uh , go on to the digits ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D :  Oh

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s^co^t^tc
D :  Um I d I did before we do the digits , I did also wanna remind people , uh please do send me , you know , uh thoughts for an agenda ,

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  yeah

dialogue type : s
D :  that that would be that 'd be good .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Eh So that , uh , people 's ideas don't get

dialogue type : s^na
D :  yeah , well it does creep up ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  doesn't it ?

dialogue type : fh
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  OK , go ahead

dialogue type : s^co
D :  OK , that 's let 's let 's let 's do digits .
