dialogue type : z
F :  OK .

dialogue type : z
F :  Um , w would you mind telling me again , please ?

dialogue type : z
F :  Oh , he 's gonna write it .

dialogue type : z
F :  OK .

dialogue type : z
F :  Now , if the batteries were to go out during the meeting , there 's really

dialogue type : z
F :  what do we do ?

dialogue type : z
F :  Do we have batteries back there ?

dialogue type : z
F :  OK .

dialogue type : z
F :  OK .

dialogue type : z
F :  And you 'll be in your office during this ?

dialogue type : z
F :  Oh , thank you very much .

dialogue type : z
F :  Thanks a lot .

dialogue type : z
F :  Appreciate it .

dialogue type : z
F :  Could you close the door for me please ?

dialogue type : z
F :  OK , thanks .

dialogue type : fg
F :  So ,

dialogue type : s^ft
F :  thanks very much for coming .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  let 's see ,

dialogue type : fh|s^t^tc
F :  so , um , as you know , the meeting today is to , um , @ @ benefit from your involvement in the data ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  all the things that that you 've been exposed to in these many months .

dialogue type : fh|s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  you 've seen some of this in the email that I sent out earlier .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  none of these these are not obligatory toca topics

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but they 're just things that I thought might be useful to discuss ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  just as a way of organizing the discussion .

dialogue type : s
F :  But if there are other topics you 'd like to discuss that 'd be great too .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Alright ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  it struck me that , um , you know , we could start out with some sort of general thing about , um , things that you found easier or more difficult with respect to transcribing or checking or using the interface or , uh , dealing with the time bins or any aspect of that type .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  And then , maybe talk about specifics specifics of the data

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  and then maybe talk about , um , aspects of the conventions

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  and then the technical set - up regarding the , um , auditory image and the interface .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qw
F :  What what did you find easiest or more s most difficult about transcribing the data ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  Parentheses , meaning uncertainty .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  good .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^g
F :  It 's sorta like a foreign language , isn't it ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  It 's basically you have these specialized terms for things that I didn't know n needed specialized terms .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's not a bad strategy .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , i it 's it 's true that I I always check the parentheses at the last stage

dialogue type : s
F :  and those are pretty easy to clear , in terms of when they 're in context .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Not a bad strategy .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  I suspect in context .

dialogue type : s
F :  And also when you have the the juxtaposition of PDA and PZM then , you

dialogue type : s
F :  Well these here are the P Z

dialogue type : s
F :  that right there .

dialogue type : s^j
F :  Uh you 've heard , the " crown of pain " .

dialogue type : s
F :  No . He was telling us , uh , before the meeting that , um , that they 're not in circulation right now ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  that they 're they were unpopular .

dialogue type : s
F :  I liked them ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and Adam liked them .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I thought the quality was good .

dialogue type : %
F : 

dialogue type : qw.%--
F :  yeah , what did he say ?

dialogue type : s
F :  He said some more things about that ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but I was n I was working on something else .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Ah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I liked them .

dialogue type : s
F :  And there 's the actually , there 's the picture of the of the Crown adjustment on the wall right there .

dialogue type : s
F :  So it sort of hooks over your ears from the back .

dialogue type : %
F :  Yeah , good c

dialogue type : x
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : qw^tc
F :  so now what about accents ?

dialogue type : qy.%-
F :  Do you have , uh Did you find any p

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  you 've studied some languages ,

dialogue type : qw^rt
F :  which which ones do you are you studying ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
F :  It 's more of a Romance direction ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
F :  or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm ,

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  so it 's not really you 're not really exposed to German very much .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
F :  Ah ! Interesting .

dialogue type : s^ba^r
F :  Interesting .

dialogue type : b
F :  Huh .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  I it 's a good question .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^no
F :  And I can't really answer that .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Oh , that 's fascinating .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
F :  Yeah , that 's that 's really interesting .

dialogue type : s
F :  I do find that the German tends to be easier for me than s than the others

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because of my c exposure and interest in German .

dialogue type : fh
F :  But , um ,

dialogue type : s^na
F :  I suspect you haven't

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  actually she she was in the middle phase I would say .

dialogue type : s
F :  We had another Spanish speaker who was earlier who was also difficult .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  But that 's really interesting .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yes . Yes yes yes .

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : %-
F :  Ex

dialogue type : %
F :  exactly .

dialogue type : s
F :  " Miss - ed " .

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
F :  Which was you know , you could predict it ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , if you knew look looked back at it ,

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  interesting .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah , I had the same experience .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s:qw
F :  Sometimes when people lack a certain level of fluency you can ask them themselves , " What did you say there ? "

dialogue type : s
F :  and they can't tell you .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  S I think it 's it 's sort of a general variability when it 's not when you 're learning a language and you haven't gotten to a certain level .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  I also wonder if if it 's partly that Span - Spanish has different pronunciations in different regions ?

dialogue type : qy.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean , not that I would know that .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  But I just wondered if ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I wonder if that would have a a contributing factor .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s
F :  And in my case with with , uh , German w I a certain region that I do well in

dialogue type : s
F :  and then get farther away from that region

dialogue type : s
F :  and I notice it 's more and more difficult .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  But she was also very low volume .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  And , um and didn't say a lot .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  I mean , I I I c I totally agree .

dialogue type : s
F :  This was a a difficult person to to understand .

dialogue type : fh
F :  But .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  I can imagine that ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  Yeah , I couldn't do it in Spanish .

dialogue type : s
F :  I 've I found myself doing that somewhat in in German .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s
F :  Or they 're laughing when they 're talking

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  we had lapels for d l brief

dialogue type : s
F :  And then sometimes people would wear these around their necks ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which would mean really basically u uh , a problem that you 're saying of getting input from others ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and also , um , it varying when they change their hea w head position .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Oh , excellent .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Oh , good to know .

dialogue type : %--
F :  S

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  so that was You 're talking about early on , the change fro into Channeltrans ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Mm - hmm ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  that 's right .

dialogue type : s
F :  Overlaps .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's interesting .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  It 's possible .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  it seems like it 's it 's related to this production idea .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  How you you internalize what you 're externalizing in a way ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  In the prev

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  They 've been here since the beginning .

dialogue type : s
F :  You 've also gone through the use the int in in introduction of the pre - segmentation , and that kind of thing .

dialogue type : s
F :  So initially they had to actually mark all the time bins themselves as well .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  I see .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  It doesn't hurt to have a pad .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  It 's it 's nicer to have a pad than not ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Nice .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Nice .

dialogue type : %
F : 

dialogue type : %
F :  Ah .

dialogue type : %
F : 

dialogue type : s^arp
F :  Well , I 'm I 'm sort of a hybrid ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so I I you know , I I appreciate having them do this ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : fh|qy.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I 've run into a couple where actually the word was totally different when you adjusted the time bin .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Have you had that happen ?

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's fascinating .

dialogue type : s^ba^na
F :  Oh , it 's really a kick .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  There are some times when there have been words that they just pause right in the middle of .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : %-
F :  i it 's h

dialogue type : fg
F :  Well ,

dialogue type : s^aap
F :  it ge u I 'm sure sometimes on purpose ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but sometimes it 'd just be s saying something and especially people who have really lo elongation in their style ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  and they say , " That 's really fascinating "

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  It 's not a great example ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but you know ?

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  it 's it 's funny how , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  i it 's funny to me that th something like that , you just change one little boundary and suddenly the whole meaning changes

dialogue type : s
F :  and I 've run across that also .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  It 's very rare . I mean , when I 've run across it .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  And , you know , maybe there are times that I haven't detected it

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and I 'm not @ @ you know , fin I haven't looked at everything .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  I 've looked at I 've probably looked at per uh s at least eighty percent of the data ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  you know , all the way through e every meeting for about eighty percent of the stuff that I 've cleared so far .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  i it s You guys are getting so good that it 's like I 'm I I i I can get through them faster , and I 'm getting to the point where I maybe don't have to go through them all the way ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  you know ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so it 's like it 's just we 've gotten to a level , it 's just really great , of , um , of of pre precision that um , it takes a lot of a load off of me .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  and so I 'm not gonna be checking them all I don't think in the @ @ for throughout the whole rest of the project .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Certainly have spot checking .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  But , um , hhh , those that I have found that way , to me , I think f f the most sensible way to handle it from my perspective was to treat it as a pronunciation situation .

dialogue type : s^co
F :  So just do a you know , a mark , then " fascinating " , and then put " PRN " and uh " interrupted by a pause " or , you know , some kind of other gloss like that , you know .

dialogue type : s
F :  You know , " P R dot dot fascinating " , whatever it is .

dialogue type : s^fa|qw^br
F :  Sorry , what was this ?

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|%-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  There was an adjustment ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  and I and I 've switched them all all the way at this point so that

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Mm - hmm , that 's right .

dialogue type : s^2.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
F :  So i you know , " OK " is a very e easy example .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  A person says , " Mm - kay "

dialogue type : %--
F :  then ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  it 's " OK " with a ha a little hatch

dialogue type : s
F :  and then , " PRN " and then " m mm - kay " , or whatever it is in quotes .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  all the different ways of reducing " and " .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because you can assume that the speech recognition , um , uh , pronunciation models will handle a certain amount of reductions of these types ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and the same thing for , um , well " the " . " The " versus " the "

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s
F :  And that they should be able to handle themselves ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and and that we assume also that for discourse purposes , those distinctions are not really the focus right now ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and those distinctions could be added later if needed

dialogue type : s^e
F :  but it 's unlikely that they would be .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  And it 's so time - consuming .

dialogue type : s
F :  So we 've made these these simplifying assumptions with that ,

dialogue type : s:qw
F :  and so then you begin to think , " Well what about " OK " ?

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , maybe " mm - kay " is an appropriate variant for " OK "

dialogue type : s
F :  and it wouldn't be necessary to mark those either ,

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  you know , it 's th this is a case where , um , I appreciate it when people mark those kinds of things

dialogue type : s
F :  but I I sort of figure that i @ @ that that 's not as far aw away from " OK " as " mm - kay " is ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  but I don't change it back if it 's there ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  you know .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  interesting .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Oh , that 's interesting .

dialogue type : qy^bh
F :  Huh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  Once in a while .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  I agree .

dialogue type : s
F :  And and when I when I 'm totally in doubt , if there 's a case where it really could be either , and I could flip a coin , I 'll choose the one that would make syntactically the most sense ,

dialogue type : s
F :  give them the benefit of the doubt that they 're being fluent about it .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  It must be really rare though ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I haven't run across that often .

dialogue type : qy
F :  Ha - ha h Is it rare ?

dialogue type : b.%
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
F :  OK . Well , le let 's see now ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  there 's another another methodo

dialogue type : s
F :  what I go I wanna ask you at some point , it just occurred to me , I 'd like to ask you the following question , maybe you can have this in the back of your minds , something like , um , you know , what sorts of hypothesis your hypothesis about the you know , ti trying to find the distributional explanations for some of these things .

dialogue type : qw.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df^j
F :  uh , I mean , don't wanna have you give away a paper topic that you wanna explore ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but ,

dialogue type : s
F :  you know , if there 's interesting th uh , hypotheses that the that y have been suggested to you by looking at the data .

dialogue type : s
F :  That kinda thing , maybe , uh , at some point .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So ,

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
F :  and al Oh ! And I also wanna say , that , um , I 'd like to meet again also next week ,

dialogue type : fh|s^no
F :  um , and I don't know if this is a good time frame ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  uh , maybe it 'd be good to have it an hour later

dialogue type : s
F :  or I don't know I mean , could do anything

dialogue type : %
F : 

dialogue type : qy^d
F :  Good time for you ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Excellent ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  cuz we could probably move it one hour later ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^fe
F :  Wow .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  You did really well .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qh
F :  Oh , did you ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK , OK .

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt
F :  Would anybody be constrained by having it be a full half hour later ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  And th the final question i

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , that 's right !

dialogue type : s
F :  Oh ! I thought she said " mistreat time " .

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Hey , they would .

dialogue type : s^na^r
F :  Yeah , they would .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  That 's that 's not a bad solution .

dialogue type : s
F :  Yeah , that 's right ,

dialogue type : s
F :  it 's already done .

dialogue type : s^j
F :  It 's good to s good to have these things all scheduled .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh ,

dialogue type : qw
F :  uh , eh then I was gonna ask you , what about an hour later ?

dialogue type : s^e
F :  I mean , if we h had those things an hour later

dialogue type : qy.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK ?

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  OK , good .

dialogue type : s
F :  Alright , so , I 'll I 'll so settle on that .

dialogue type : s^tc
F :  OK now , I wanted to say , you 've been through a couple of different , uh , @ @ improvements in the methods , the pre - segmentation .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , s let 's ask if it was an improvement from your standpoint .

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh , the Tigerfish , um , approach .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So ,

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  uh , s moving from having the first transcription done by an external service , and then you correcting that versus doing the initial transcription yourselves .

dialogue type : qy.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qy.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qy.%-
F :  has there already been t

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Yeah , IBM or if if it was dash TF ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  that 's the Tigerfish .

dialogue type : %-
F :  So d

dialogue type : s^na
F :  There 's a lot of that .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
F :  that 's right too .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^ba^r
F :  Wow ,

F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I 'm not sure if you had an IBM one .

dialogue type : s
F :  So this was earlier on .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  You probably do .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  So you didn't get one ?

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Oh , interesting .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  No .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  In neither case .

dialogue type : s
F :  And I 'm and I 'm thinking I 'm thinking you 're causing me to think back over what the differences were in the what they got

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  We 're not sure really how Tigerfish does it ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  you know , the methodology .

dialogue type : qw
F :  How do they do this .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F :  Because sometimes you 'll have the s the same word ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  well , within a single turn , l it 'll be spelled in three different ways .

dialogue type : s:qy^rt
F :  And it 's like , you know , is this the same person who 's kind of forgetful ,

dialogue type : qrr^rt
F :  or is it that they have several people doing it together ?

dialogue type : s^am
F :  You know , maybe it 's parallel .

dialogue type : s^am
F :  Maybe they 're all doing it in parallel

dialogue type : s^e
F : 

dialogue type : qh^rt
F :  But , who knows ?

dialogue type : h|s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's linearized .

dialogue type : s
F :  So if you picture what we have on the screen ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I 'm doing it from my perspective .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  You have this block

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and it goes over to here and stops

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and this person starts to talk

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and he goes over to here

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and then you have an overlap over here .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  And so what they would get is this block from the first guy ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  this block from the second guy ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and then the top of the overlap

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and then the second guy in the overlap .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  And then it would move on .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  So it 's sort of like this you know , you go this way as much as you can ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  then you cycle through there

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and then you go up to this next level

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : h
F :  Um ,

dialogue type : h
F :  let 's see ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh !

dialogue type : fh|s^nd
F :  uh , they hear them separately in two chunks ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but then sometimes they get confused about who the foreground speaker is , because they 're not being told who the foreground speaker is .

dialogue type : fh
F :  You know ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and especially you can see if you have like four speakers , it be reason you can maybe find a way of doing that .

dialogue type : s^e.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  So what they get is they get a beep that tells them when there 's something that they think that the f pre - segmenter thought there should be s transcribed in there .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  And it 's numbered so that we end up with the same number of of transcribed slots .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Cuz the first time when we didn't have them numbered , we ended up with a couple extra segments that were transcribed ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and it was hard to patch the whole thing back together

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because when it comes back to our end , um , it 's just this long string of things that they 've uh , partitioned according to the tape that they were given .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Cuz they don't they actually don't have digital interface either

dialogue type : s
F :  so it 's it 's audiotape .

dialogue type : s
F :  And they type it on

dialogue type : s
F :  and then then it comes back to us

dialogue type : s
F :  and Adam and Thilo have a program wa they put it back together into our interface format

dialogue type : s
F :  and then we can use it .

dialogue type : fh
F :  But ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  um ,

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  um , there are f cases where you 'll get a segment and it 's someone else 's utterance

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and that 's because that was overlapping with someone else and this is the weaker speaker of the two ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and you 'll have like two totally parallel r renditions of the same thing .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F :  Because i it 's just i n

dialogue type : s
F :  So what they get is like i t is they get something like " beep one " .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then then they get " beep two " , " beep three " .

dialogue type : s
F :  Chuck Wooters does the numbers .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  And , um , it cycles through .

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No .

dialogue type : s
F :  And they don't know which channel is s l supposed to be together .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  exactly .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Yeah , that 's quite right .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  And that 's why .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Exactly right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  They 're very fast .

dialogue type : %
F :  Is l

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  It it turns out that they 're really much faster than the other approaches we 've used ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and we don't know exactly how they do it

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and I think that that 's by intention , that @ @ not just me who thinks that it 's that proprietarily , it 's a very competitive business

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and they probably don't wanna , uh , say too much about it .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  But they 're very fast .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Huh .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Excellent .

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh ! I see .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Oh , interesting .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Oh , how interesting .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  And this is when you crank up the visual .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah . OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah , it 's true .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
F :  It 's true ,

dialogue type : s^na
F :  it 's just a big mess .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , i it 's a judgment call .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  And you can also say well , you know , if the backchannels were so limit so low on volume that they weren't o visually obvious , then you can say , " Well , it 's reasonable not to worry about them . "

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Yeah , that 's tr right , That 's quite right .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  I agree .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  It Well , it 's communicative .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy.%--
F :  Have you noticed that Tiger

dialogue type : s
F :  I 've noticed that Tigerfish uses " cough " a lot where it isn't really a cough .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  You notice that ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy.%--
F : 

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  i This has caused me to wonder .

dialogue type : qy.%--
F :  So , in Tigerfish ones , do you find that where they 've where they have like " dot dot 's " cuz it 's segments they didn't hear , that that you add u

dialogue type : s
F :  you probably do add things in those places where it 's where nothing is transcribed really , because they didn't even hear it .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Interesting .

dialogue type : s^ba^r
F :  Oh , interesting .

dialogue type : b
F :  Huh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  It just occurred to me ,

dialogue type : s
F :  this is a a different kind of question ,

dialogue type : %--
F :  but I w

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  from having listened to all these people ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , and it is kind of ab abnormal to be listening to them as if you 're they 're talking into your ear , really .

dialogue type : s
F :  You know , it 's this really unusual acoustic circumstances .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I sort of end up feeling like I know these people better than I really do .

dialogue type : s
F :  And it 's like you go out to tea and there they are

dialogue type : s:s^ba
F :  and , " Oh , you were so funny in that meeting "

dialogue type : s
F :  and it it has this sort of unusual dynamic

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because , you know , I I 'm privy to information which really by all rights I shouldn't be ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  except of course they they agreed ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  they signed ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  they were there ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  they agreed .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  But but it but it 's sort of an unusual relationship to say ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  you know , i i you know ,

dialogue type : s
F :  if you 're in the meeting yourself , then you of course you 'd have access to all this information and all your inferences about , you know , whether they 're funny or not funny or whatever ,

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Oh , that 'd be interesting .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
F :  He 's he 's on campus ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I found this out .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah yeah yeah yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Nice guy .

dialogue type : s^na^r
F :  Nice guy .

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  Oh , but he is .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I went on I actually went on a hike with him two weeks three weeks ago .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  Nice guy .

dialogue type : s
F :  Oh , she 's here .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yeah , I 'm sure you 've seen her ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yeah yeah , that 's no problem .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  you know , if someone sits there and and

dialogue type : s
F :  it th there 's this o one who doesn't say much ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but she just is always pleasant .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
F :  You know ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and it 's kind of a smiling voice and she laughs

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  What a difference .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  um , she 's she 's just so pleasant .

dialogue type : s
F :  And and , you know , adds a lot just by virtue of that .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  You know , can People will talk on all these technical things

dialogue type : s^e
F :  but she 'll she 'll say something technical and then laugh ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's it 's very interesting , the ambience that you can get through these these little things .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  I agree with you .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  I agree ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  it 's it 's really interesting , Also ,

dialogue type : s
F :  i it 's a persona ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  there 's definitely a sense of persona .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Yeah , it 's difficult .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  um , it 's mainly a matter of two things .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  First is the storage . It 'd be so huge that , uh , you 'd wanna be sure that it was of interest to someone ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  that it would be worthwhile doing .

dialogue type : s
F :  And that 's the other thing , that we don't have

dialogue type : s^e
F :  someone currently doing the video thing .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  It would really be interesting .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  That was Liz 's idea .

dialogue type : s
F :  Oh , well , it 's a question of feedback , and being able to give feedback .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Exactly .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  And , you know I mean , th that was the meeting where , um , @ @ you know the m the th y y Partitions wouldn't work .

dialogue type : s
F :  Another possibility is pa partitions wouldn't work

dialogue type : s^df
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  so it 's like you have these unusual configuration problems that that you wouldn't normally have .

dialogue type : s
F :  Yeah , blindfolds .

dialogue type : s:s^cs
F :  You know , and someone else said , " Well , maybe you could just turn the light out . "

dialogue type : s:s^ar
F :  But then , someone else said no ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz there are these m special lights that have to stay on all the time

dialogue type : s^e
F :  for the fire code or whatever it is .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , there are other things we could expand on and with i in terms of the methodology .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's nice to have a core set of data though

dialogue type : s
F :  and they 've d actually done some they 've had some good results in terms of the digits

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which they do in terms of having a r a nice broad set of speakers doing the same thing , meeting after meeting after meeting .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : %--
F :  I 'm wondering ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qw
F :  uh you know I mean , what should we do in terms of tea ?

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt
F :  if we could hang on for fifteen more minutes and have tea ?

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt
F :  And then continue with this this next next week ?

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 'd be great .

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so , um ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  let 's see .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Mm - hmm ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  that 's right .

dialogue type : qy.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qy.%--
F :  I mean , does everyone agree with that intu

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , I f I s share her intuition that 's it 's it is sort of unusual to have " so " used as a final , uh , part of a person 's turn .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  I was wondering .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yes , that 's possible ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  interesting .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %--
F :  Of course

dialogue type : s^nd
F :  b but that 's not really an example of this ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because they don't just say " so " .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Is that right ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I mean , s I just wanna be sure .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  " I c I could get all those extra signatures ,

dialogue type : s:s^no
F :  but I don't know ,

dialogue type : s:fh
F :  so . "

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  That 's a very nice characterization .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Interesting .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  Once again a sh

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  is it a shrug ?

dialogue type : qy^r^rt
F :  Would you say it 's another shrug ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Yeah , that 's interesting .

dialogue type : qy^bh
F :  Huh .

dialogue type : qy^bh
F :  Huh ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  interesting .

dialogue type : qw
F :  What about , um , the way people treat w when they give a joke ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  I mean , and and they 're like they laugh

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and then after the laugh they say , " uh " .

dialogue type : fh
F :  I mean ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^e:s
F :  so it 's like , " ha - ha - ha

dialogue type : s:fh
F :  uh " .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Do you Have you run across this ?

dialogue type : s
F :  And it 's like , to me I I think I 've heard comedians do that .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  you know , you you make a joke

dialogue type : s
F :  and then you have an " uh " in there somehow ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which I don't really understand the function of .

dialogue type : qy.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^am
F :  It 's possible ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I didn't have the extra the extra e um , what do you say , nuances in the " uh " , which you just which you just did .

dialogue type : s
F :  However , the context fits .

dialogue type : s^ba
F : 

dialogue type : s^aap
F :  It 's possible .

dialogue type : s^aap^r
F :  It 's possible .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's just a normal " uh " .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  maybe it 's a little louder than usual .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  It 's not any of the extra , um , you know , glottal thing .

dialogue type : h
F :  Well ,

dialogue type : s^ng.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  You know it really is like a placeholder of some sort ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which I think is self - reflexive in in the sort of brings focus back onto the jokemaker ,

dialogue type : %
F : 

dialogue type : s^am
F :  Yeah , that 's possible .

dialogue type : fh
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^am
F :  Oh . It could be .

dialogue type : s^am
F :  Yes , po that 's possible .

dialogue type : s^am^r
F :  It 's possible .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Exactly who I was thinking of actually .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah . Exactly .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's true ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  And he does continue after that .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  But it 's just you know , to say " uh " you kn to say " uh " while you 're laughing i it 's just to me it 's an interesting category .

dialogue type : s^am
F :  That 's possible .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Very interesting .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Interesting .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Huh , OK .

dialogue type : %
F :  Oh n

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
F :  He 's very funny .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  He 's very funny .

dialogue type : s
F :  I I started laughing with something he said the other day ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  it was it was the beginning of a meeting

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and it hadn't gotten far into it

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and he 's he 's doing this one of these mock fights with Nancy ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which he does .

dialogue type : qy
F :  Have you run across these mock fights ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  And he s he says , um , something like ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  I i and he 's m e they they have this nice @ @ mutual condescending joking thing going on ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  and he says , " Well , I could explain this to you .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  I have a better laugh than you do .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  The transcribers told me so . "

dialogue type : s
F :  And it went on a little longer

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and then at one point she you know , at another meeting , she she was not sure which channel she was on ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  and he said , " Well , I think you 're on channel so - and - so "

dialogue type : s:s^ar
F :  and then she said , " Well , no ,

dialogue type : s:qy
F :  sh shouldn't it be channel so - and - so ? "

dialogue type : s:s^ar
F :  and he says " Well , no ,

dialogue type : s:s^df
F :  it should be channel so - and - so " .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then it turned out it was channel so - and - so

dialogue type : s^e
F :  which he said ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  and and she said he s he said , " I bested you again Nancy " .

dialogue type : s:s^aa
F :  And she said , " Yes ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  that 's my recollection of all of our meetings together " .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Those sorts of things , i it 's true ,

dialogue type : s
F :  you know , it 's like , it really does liven things up to have the , uh , the nice interrelationships .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I I found that 's a nice aspect of a lot of these meetings ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  the eh the , uh , eh little periods of humor like that .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Alright ,

dialogue type : s^cs^tc
F :  well , so do we would would we could do digits if we so desired .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  If w if we wanted to do that .

dialogue type : s^m^na
F :  Let 's do simultaneous digits .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  No , you don't ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  OK , the idea is that you have then , um , you have ground truth ,

dialogue type : s
F :  you know exactly what they 're supposed to have said ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and then of course sometimes we go through and actually , um , people do double check that they read them correctly and all ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  so that we 're sure ,

dialogue type : s
F :  as you 've done .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^d
F :  And you did also ?

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because it 's it 's it should be able to be taken care of efficiently with this interface .

dialogue type : s^co
F :  I mean , if the T Tigerfish people do it , then , you know , leave it ,

dialogue type : s
F :  that 's fine .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^m^na
F :  Sometimes they don't .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , if you do that 's that 's alright as well .

dialogue type : s^m^na
F :  You don't have to .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Because , uh , we 're we have the assumption that we 'll take care of it this in this other way ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but In any case , the idea is that you have ground truth ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  you know exactly what the person should have said

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and you check to be sure ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and usually there aren't many errors eh w when they were checked .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Um , and then , you have this multiplicity of voices , uh , reading these things ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  and you can do really good speech recognition that way .

dialogue type : s
F :  So they have some papers out that they 've done this .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's really it 's been very fruitful in terms of the analyses .

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Uh , you know , it 's like , uh , psychological approach also that you like to have some standard stimulus here

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  I I agree ,

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  I think it 's a nice it 's a nice design feature .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Yes , you run across that .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Let 's see ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  it 's up there .

dialogue type : b
F :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^t3
F :  Up there at the top .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^aap
F :  Used to be .

dialogue type : s^aap^r
F :  Used to be .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  This they changed them .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Initially it was words all spelled out ,

dialogue type : s^e
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
F :  And that was like a Stroop test in some ways .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  It took a lot of conc

dialogue type : s
F :  When I was doing those I had to really concentrate .

dialogue type : s^e:s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  you know , it was like You really had to " let 's see , the words and the numbers "

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and then you 'd have an " OH " periodically

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  and , um , they were initially spelled out that way ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  one or the other .

dialogue type : s
F :  But we converted them to this format ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean , you could conceivably put an " OH " or a " zero " for the " O 's " and still have this benefit ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but I think that the idea is that people can choose what they think is most natural for them to say in those those locations ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^df
F : 

dialogue type : s^e
F :  different sized strings .

dialogue type : s
F :  But to have them broken up like this , it 's it 's m been about uh maybe half a year that that this or maybe maybe seven months , I don't know , maybe longer , that they 've gotten actually broken up within the line .

dialogue type : s
F :  So the idea is @ @ to pause when you see that .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  No .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right ,

dialogue type : s^na
F :  break it up more finely .

dialogue type : h
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I would say don't worry about that ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
F :  because , um , this is w

dialogue type : s
F :  again you know , it it 'd be nice to get the words right ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  the uh , the interface that these guys used , uh , allows you to set the time boundaries really accurately ,

dialogue type : s
F :  so it 's not so important .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's more important to focus on the words ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because there we don't know the ground truth .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : s^no
F :  Well , I don't know ,

dialogue type : qw
F :  how do you feel ?

dialogue type : %-
F :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  what we could do is we could do it together one week

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  and then separate the next

dialogue type : s
F :  or something like that

dialogue type : s^e
F :  to give the variety .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : qw^cs
F :  why don't we do them together this time

dialogue type : s^df
F :  just because in the interest of time , to get you out in time .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so , um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  we just start out , we and you s you say , " transcript L " whatever it is ,

dialogue type : s^co^rt
F :  and then launch into the numbers

dialogue type : s^co
F :  and then pause between the gr the gaps

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  you s well , you 're supposed to treat each line as kind of like a little sentence .

dialogue type : qw^t1
F :  What do they say ,

dialogue type : s^t1
F :  " Each line into smaller groups .

dialogue type : s
F :  Please read each string as if you were giving it to someone over the telephone using the groupings indicated .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes ,

dialogue type : s^na
F :  there you go .
