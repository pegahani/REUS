dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  sure .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  last week I finally got results from the SRI system about this mean subtraction approach .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  And , um , we we got an improvement , uh , in word error rate , training on the TI - digits data set and testing on Meeting Recorder digits of , um , six percent to four point five percent ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  um , on the n on the far - mike data

dialogue type : s^e
E :  using PZM F ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but , um , the near - mike performance worsened , um , from one point two percent to two point four percent .

dialogue type : fh
E :  And , um ,

dialogue type : qw^df
E :  wh why would that be , um , considering that we actually got an improvement in near - mike performance using HTK ?

dialogue type : fh
E :  And so ,

dialogue type : s
E :  uh , with some input from , uh , Andreas , I have a theory in two parts .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  first of all HTK sorry , SR - the SRI system is doing channel adaptation ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  and so HTK wasn't .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  so this ,

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  This mean subtraction approach will do a kind of channel normalization

dialogue type : s^df
E :  and so that might have given the HTK use of it a boost that wouldn't have been applied in the SRI case .

dialogue type : s
E :  And also , um , the Andreas pointed out the SRI system is using more parameters .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  It 's got finer - grained acoustic models .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  So those finer - grained acoustic models could be more sensitive to the artifacts in the re - synthesized audio .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s
E :  And me and Barry were listening to the re - synthesized audio

dialogue type : s
E :  and sometimes it seems like you get of a bit of an echo of speech in the background .

dialogue type : s
E :  And so that seems like it could be difficult for training ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  cuz you could have different phones lined up with a different foreground phone , um , depending on the timing of the echo .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s^cc
E :  I 'm gonna try training on a larger data set ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and then , eh , the system will have seen more examples o of these artifacts and hopefully will be more robust to them .

dialogue type : s^cc
E :  So I 'm planning to use the Macrophone set of , um , read speech ,

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : fh
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
E :  In thi in this room ?

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Y Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
E :  I I I I don't know .

dialogue type : s
E :  O o one thing , um , I noticed is that , um , the mean subtraction seems to make the PZM signals louder after they 've been re - synthesized .

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  So I was wondering , is it possible that one reason it helped with the Aurora baseline system is just as a kind of gain control ?

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Cuz some of the PZM signals sound pretty quiet if you don't amplify them .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^no
E :  Yeah . I don't know why - y , uh , either .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  It w i i it wouldn't affect things .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E : 

dialogue type : h
E :  Um .

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
E :  Did I w what ?

dialogue type : qw^br^d^rt
E :  Sorry ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : %-
E :  I b

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  I trained on clean TI - digits .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  I I did the mean subtraction on clean TI - digits .

dialogue type : s^no
E :  But I didn't I 'm not sure if it made the clean ti TI - digits any louder .

dialogue type : s
E :  I only remember noticing it made the , um , PZM signal louder .

dialogue type : b
E :  Huh .

dialogue type : fh
E :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
E :  If it 's if it 's like , if it 's trying to find a a reverberation filter , it could be that this reverberation filter is making things quieter .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then if you take it out that taking it out makes things louder .

dialogue type : fh
E :  I mean .

dialogue type : b
E :  Nuh - huh .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  The mean .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cc
E :  So I should maybe listen to that stuff again .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh . OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : h
E :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  I think so .

dialogue type : s^df^na
E :  If you 're talking about the Macrophone results that Andreas had about , um , a week and a half ago , I think it 's the same system .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  I didn't .

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
E :  And I also , um , did some experiments about normalizing the phase .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s
E :  So I c I came up with a web page that people can take a look at .

dialogue type : fh
E :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  the interesting thing that I tried was , um , Adam and Morgan had this idea ,

dialogue type : s
E :  um , since my original attempts to , um , take the mean of the phase spectra over time and normalize using that , by subtracting that off , didn't work . Um , so , well , that we thought that might be due to , um , problems with , um , the arithmetic of phases .

dialogue type : s
E :  They they add in this modulo two pi way

dialogue type : fh
E :  and ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  there 's reason to believe that that approach of taking the mean of the phase spectrum wasn't really mathematically correct .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , what I did instead is I took the mean of the FFT spectrum without taking the log or anything , and then I took the phase of that ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and I subtracted that phase off

dialogue type : s^e
E :  to normalize .

dialogue type : s
E :  But that , um , didn't work either .

dialogue type : s
E :  And , yeah , that 's everything .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^e
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  You know , the the Aurora baseline is set up with these , um this version of the clean training set that 's been filtered with this G - seven - one - two filter ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  and ,

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  um , to train the SRI system on digits S - Andreas used the original TI - digits ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
E :  um , under U doctor - speech data TI - digits ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  which don't have this filter .

dialogue type : s
E :  But I don't think there 's any other difference .

dialogue type : h|s^aa
E :  Um . Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
E :  W w it was one one point two

dialogue type : s^e
E :  with the SRI system ,

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : %-
E :  D d

dialogue type : qy^bu.%-
E :  Do you mean the b ?

dialogue type : s
E :  The baseline Aurora - two system , trained on TI - digits , tested on Meeting Recorder near ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I think we saw in it today ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and it was about six point six percent .
