dialogue type : s^na
C :  Well , I 've been reading some literature about clustering of data .

dialogue type : s
C :  Just , um , I guess , let me put it in context .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  OK , so we 're talking about discovering intermediate categories to , um to classify .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And , uh , I was looking at some of the work that , uh , Sangita was doing on these TRAPS things .

dialogue type : s
C :  So she has , um she has temporal patterns for , um , a certain set of phonemes , from from TIMIT ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  the most common phonemes .

dialogue type : s
C :  And each one of them has has a a nice pattern over time , a one one second window .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it has has these patterns .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um , so she has , um a TRAP for each one of the phonemes , um , times fifteen , for each of the fifteen critical bands .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And , um , she does this agglomerative hierarchical clustering which which basically , um , is a clustering algorithm that , uh , starts with many , many , many different points many different clusters uh , corresponding to the number of data , uh , patterns that you have in the data .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then you have this distance mej metric which , uh , measures how how closely related they are .

dialogue type : s
C :  And you start , um by merging the patterns that are most closely related .

dialogue type : %-
C :  And

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  y yeah , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^m
C :  a dendrogram tree .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C :  Right , usually it 's when , um when the sol similarity measures , um , don't go down as much .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so , uh so you stop at that point .

dialogue type : s
C :  And what she found was , sh um , was there were five broad , um broad categories , uh , corresponding to , uh , things like , uh , fricatives and , uh , vocalic , um , and , uh , stops .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , uh , one for silence and and another one for schwa schwa sounds .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um , and , um , I was thinking about ways to to generalize this

dialogue type : s^df^rt
C :  because w you 're it 's sort of like a it 's not a completely automatic way of clustering ,

dialogue type : s^df^e
C :  because yo beforehand you have these these TRAPS and you 're saying that that these frames correspond to this particular phoneme .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um , and that 's that 's constraining your your clustering to to the set of phonemes that you already have .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
C :  Um , whereas maybe we want to just take take a look at , um , arbitrary windows in time , um , of varying length , um , and cluster those .

dialogue type : sj
C :  And I 'm thinking if we if we do that , then we would probably , um , at some point in the clustering algorithm find that we 've clustered things like , OK , thi this is a transition , um , this is a relatively stable stable point .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
C :  Um , and I 'm hoping to find other things of of similarity and maybe use these things as the intermediate , um intermediate categories that , uh , um , I 'll later classify .

dialogue type : h|s^bk
C :  Um , right .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa^r
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I I haven't exactly figured out , um , the exact details for that

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  but , uh , the the representation of the data that I was thinking of , was using , um , critical band , um , energies , um , over different lengths of time .

dialogue type : fh
C :
