dialogue type : z
D :  How many batteries do you go through ?

dialogue type : s
D :  " I am Sm - I am Smarticus " is what it 's saying .

dialogue type : %
D :  I gue

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  So . Bu - Uh , i The way the uh , the dialogue manager works is it dumps out what it wants to know , or what it wants to tell the person , to a er in XML

dialogue type : s
D :  and there 's a conversion system for different uh , to go from XML to something else .

dialogue type : s
D :  And th so , the knowledge base for the system , that generates the syntasti syntactic structures for the ge generation is uh , in a LISP - like the knowledge base is in a LISP - like form .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then the thing that actually builds these syntactic structures is something based on Prolog .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , you have a basically , a goal

dialogue type : s
D :  and it , you know , says " OK , well I 'm gonna try to do the Greet - the - person goal ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so it just starts uh , it binds some variables and it just decides to , you know , do some subscold .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Basically , it just means " build the tree . "

dialogue type : s
D :  And then it passes the tree onto , uh , the ge the generation module .

dialogue type : fg
D :  We

dialogue type : fg
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , the syntax trees are very simple .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  It 's like most of the sentences in one tree ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and instead of , you know , breaking down to , like , small units and building back up , they basically took the sentences , and basically cut them in half , or you know , into thirds or something like that , and made trees out of those .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And so uh , uh Tilman wrote a little tool that you could take LISP notation and generate an XML , uh , tree . Uh , S what do ca structure from the from the LISP .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  And so basically you just say , you know , " noun goes to " , you know ,

dialogue type : s^no
D :  Er , nah , I don't re I 've never been good at those .

dialogue type : s
D :  So there 's like the VP goes to N and those things in LISP , and it will generate for you .

dialogue type : s^ng^rt
D :  Why I had I did need to chan generate different trees than the German ones ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  mainly because you know like uh , the gerund in in German is automatically taken care of with just a regular verb ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  so I 'd uh have to add " am walking , "

dialogue type : s
D :  or I 'd have to add a little stem for the " am " , when I build the built the tree .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D :  Well Tilman s

dialogue type : qw^rt^t3
D :  OK , you know how to do it ?

dialogue type : s^cs^t3
D :  You should probably move the microphone closer to your face .

dialogue type : s^t3
D :  There 's like a little The twisty thing , you can move it with .

dialogue type : %-
D :  Wa

dialogue type : fg
D : 

dialogue type : s^aap.%--
D :  To some de

dialogue type : fh|qw
D :  uh what what part of th the SmartKom stuff ?

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Oh yeah yeah .

dialogue type : fg
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  I did look into that , uh in terms of , you know , exploding the nodes out and down ag

dialogue type : s
D :  JavaBayes does not support that .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  I can imagine a way of hacking at the code to do that .

dialogue type : sj^rt
D :  It 'd probably take two weeks or so to actually go through and do it ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and I went through all the other packages on Murph - Kevin Murphy 's page ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I couldn't find the necessary mix of free and uh with the GUI and , with this thing that we want .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cc.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  How do you spell that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  Oh no .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  No sir .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Nnn .

dialogue type : s
D :  This Well , I 've I have projects , but then the my prof professor of one of my classes also wa has a final that he 's giving us .

dialogue type : s
D :  And he 's giving us five days to do it which means it going to be hard .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Aikin , Alex , yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , the seventeenth will definitely be the last day , like it or not for me .

dialogue type : s^bk^t3
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^t3
D :  Hi

dialogue type : s^t3
D :  Wednesday 's much better for me , yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Bhaskara .
