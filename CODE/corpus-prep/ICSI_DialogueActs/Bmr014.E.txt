dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Alright .

dialogue type : %-
E :  So .

dialogue type : s
E :  It is uh , must be February fifteenth .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  We didn't have a front - end meeting today .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
E :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^tc
E :  OK .

dialogue type : %--
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
E :  Agenda .

dialogue type : qo^t
E :  Any agenda items today ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK audio monitoring , Jane .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , were this a professional audio recording , what we would do what you would do is in testing it is , you would actually do all this wiggling and make sure that that that things are not giving that kind of performance .

dialogue type : s
E :  And if they are , then they can't be used .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s^t1
E :  Um . Let 's see .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
E :  I guess I would like to have a discussion about you know where we are on uh , recording , transcription

dialogue type : s
E :  you know , basically you know where we are on the corpus .

dialogue type : s^t
E :  And then um , the other thing which I would like to talk about which is a real meta - quest , I think , deal is , uh , agendas .

dialogue type : s^tc
E :  So maybe I 'll I 'll start with that actually .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Uh , um . Andreas brought up the fact that he would kinda like to know , if possible , what we were gonna be talking about

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because he 's sort of peripherally involved to this point ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and if there 's gonna be a topic about discussion about something that he uh strongly cares about then he would come

dialogue type : s
E :  and And I think part of part of his motivation with this is that he 's trying to help us out ,

dialogue type : s
E :  in the because of uh the fact that the meetings are are tending to become reasonably large now on days when everybody shows up

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  and and I 'm sure help out his own time .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  I 'd I think that this is a wish on his part .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Uh . It 's actually gonna be hard

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because it seems like a lot of times uh things come up that are unanticipated

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  But um , we could try anyway ,

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  uh , do another try at coming up with the agenda uh , at some point before the meeting ,

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
E :  uh , say the day before .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^cs^rt
E :  You you wanna volunteer to do that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s
E :  Alright so we 'll send out agenda request .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah , I have to tell you for the uh for the admin meeting that we have , Lila does that um every time before an admin meeting .

dialogue type : s
E :  And uh

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  But but But .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
E :  Uh . But we can try .

dialogue type : s
E :  Maybe it 'll work .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^tc.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^tc
E :  So we 're done with that topic .

dialogue type : s^t
E :  The other topic I was thinking of was the sta status on microphones and channels , and all that .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qh^cs
E :  Why why don't we do that .

dialogue type : qw
E :  So how many channels do you get to have in a wireless setup ?

dialogue type : %-
E :  So , um .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^bu
E :  And right now we can have up to six .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bu
E :  Beyond the mike the cost of the mikes the only thing is the base station that 's nine hundred dollars .

dialogue type : s^co
E :  Oh , we should do it .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : fg
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^tc
E :  But we 've had more problems with that .

dialogue type : s
E :  And that sort of bypasses the whole the whole Jimbox thing and all that .

dialogue type : s
E :  And so um , we we seem to have uh , a reliable way of getting the data in , which is through the ra Sony radio mikes ,

dialogue type : s
E :  as long as we 're conscious about the batteries .

dialogue type : s
E :  That seems to be the key issue .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um , That 's the only thing with them .

dialogue type : s
E :  But the quality seems really good

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um I heard from UW that they 're they 're uh very close to getting their , uh setup purchased .

dialogue type : s
E :  They 're they 're they 're buying something that you can just sort of buy off the shelf .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s^no
E :  Uh , I don't know .

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  Probably we shouldn't probably we shouldn't talk about funding stuff .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^tc
E :  But anyway there 's there 's there 's uh , uh other activities that are going on there and and uh and NIST and UW .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um . But but yeah I thin I think that at least the message we can tell other people is that our experience is is quite positive with the Sony ,

dialogue type : s
E :  uh , radio - mikes .

dialogue type : s^tc
E :  Now the one thing that you have said that actually concerns me a little is you 're talking about changing the headsets

dialogue type : s
E :  meaning changing the connector , which means some hand - soldering or something ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^g
E :  right ?

dialogue type : qy^bh^m^rt
E :  No ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s
E :  Nothing against you and your hand - soldering

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : fh|s^bs^tc.%--
E :  Uh , OK , so that 's being done professionally

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^arp.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , we 'll see what it it 's like .

dialogue type : sj
E :  That tha that can be quite good .

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Good .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
E :  So let 's go with that .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Uh ,

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , um , uh , Dave isn't here but he was going to start working on some things with the digits .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Uh , so he 'll be interested in what 's going on with that .

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
E :  Was the decision last time was that the the uh transcribers were going to be doing stuff with the digits as well ?

dialogue type : qr.%--
E :  Has that started , or is that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  So anyway I think we we have at least one uh , user for the digits once they get done , which will be Dave .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^no
E :  I don't know if Dave is on the list ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
E :  if he 's invited to these meetings ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  uh

dialogue type : s^e^rt.%--
E :  if he knows .

dialogue type : s^no
E :  I don't know .

dialogue type : h|s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah , so this might be a conflict for him .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|%--
E :  Uh , so .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , that 's why we 're not seeing him .

dialogue type : fh
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|s^t^tc
E :  Uh , transcriptions , uh , beyond the digits , where we are , and so on .

dialogue type : s^t
E :  And the and the recordings also ,

dialogue type : s
E :  just where we are .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
E :  How much of that is digits ?

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bu
E :  that 's including digits ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
E :  right ?

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  So anyway there 's at least probably thirty hours ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
E :  of Of non - digits .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  And and again the main track that you 're working with is elev eleven hours ?

dialogue type : qy^g
E :  Is that right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  Is that is that that including digits ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean it 's probably more than that but but with of of non - digits .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw^tc.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw
E :  What are some of the other features ? Besides the energy ?

dialogue type : s
E :  You said you 're trying some different features , or something .

dialogue type : s^2^bu^rt
E :  Cu - Cube root ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Ah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  Fletcher Munson ?

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah , alright .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um , let 's see .

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : qr^tc.%-
E :  Were were you basically done with

dialogue type : s^t^tc
E :  the transcription part ? So I guess the next thing is this uh bleep editing .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  I I can't help but wonder if this is maybe a little more elaborate than is needed .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fh
E :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , for me I would actually want to have some pieces of paper that had the transcription and I would sort of flip through it .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then um if I thought it was OK , I 'd say " it 's OK " .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  uh I mean it depends how this really ends up working out ,

dialogue type : sj
E :  but I guess my thought was that the occasion of somebody wondering whether something was OK or not and needing to listen to it was gonna be extremely rare .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  I think what I was sort of saying is that if you just say " here is a here is "

dialogue type : s:qy
E :  I mean this maybe it sounds paleolithic but but I just thought if you handed them some sheets of paper , that said , uh , " here 's what was said in this transcription is it OK with you ?

dialogue type : s
E :  and if it is , here 's this other sheet of paper that you sign that says that it 's OK " .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then they 'd hand it back to you .

dialogue type : qy.%--
E : 

dialogue type : qw
E :  I mean how do you read books ?

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
E :  Really ?

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Going to a web site is easy ,

dialogue type : sj^nd
E :  but flipping through a hundred pounds a hundred pages of stuff is not easy on the web .

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
E :  Really ?

dialogue type : s
E :  So here 's the way I was imagining it , and maybe I 'm wrong ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but the way I imagined it was that um , the largest set of people is gonna go " oh yeah , I didn't say anything funny in that meeting

dialogue type : s^co
E :  just go ahead ,

dialogue type : qw
E :  where 's the where 's the release ? "

dialogue type : s
E :  And then there 'll be a subset of people ,

dialogue type : qy^f^rt
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^co
E :  I mean think of who it is we 've been recording mostly .

dialogue type : s
E :  OK there 'll be a subset of people , who um , will say uh " well , yeah , I really would like to see that . "

dialogue type : sj.%--
E :  And for them , the easiest way to flip through , if it 's a really large document ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean unless you 're searching .

dialogue type : s
E :  Searching , of course , should be electronic ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  so if you provide some search mechanism you go to every place they said something or something like that ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but see then we 're getting more elaborate with this thing .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um if if uh you don't have search mechanisms you just sort of have this really , really long document ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean whenever I 've had a really , really long document that it was sitting on the web , I 've always ended up printing it out .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , you you 're you 're not necessarily gonna be sitting at the desk all the time ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , this is how I was imagining it , anyway .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then I figured , that out of that group , there would be a subset who would go " hmm you know I 'm really not sure about this section here , "

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  S It seems like i

dialogue type : s
E :  if I 'm right in that , it seems like you 're setting it up for the most infrequent case , rather than for the most frequent case .

dialogue type : s
E :  So that uh , now we have to worry about privacy ,

dialogue type : s
E :  we have to worry about all these passwords , for different people

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : h|s^aa
E :  Um , yeah , that 's true .

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s^am
E :  Yeah , I guess we don't need their signature .

dialogue type : s
E :  I guess an email OK is alright .

dialogue type : s^nd^no
E :  Uh I don't know about that .

dialogue type : s^bu
E :  But th what they signed in the consent form , was something that said you can use my voice .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  Right ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ng
E :  Yeah , but that 's our decision then .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
E :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  I think it is .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  I see .

dialogue type : s
E :  OK , well , if that 's what it said .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Um I mean it 's also a mixture of people ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean some people are r do their work primarily by sitting at the computer , flipping around the web ,

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  and others do not .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  this uh a a set of skills that they would have to gain .

dialogue type : qy^f
E :  You know ?

dialogue type : s
E :  It depends on what meetings .

dialogue type : s^aap
E :  In the meetings so far , yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  But we 're trying to expand this ,

dialogue type : qy^f
E :  right ?

dialogue type : s
E :  So I I I actually think that paper is the more universal thing .

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  No , I think we have to be able to print it out .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's not just if they want to print it out .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : %-
E :  I I th

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^arp
E :  Certainly for everybody who 's been in the meetings so far it would be sufficient .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^tc
E :  There 's another aspect to this which maybe is part of why this is bothering me .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um , I think you 're really trying very hard to make this as convenient as possible for people to do this .

dialogue type : fg
E :  I I I understand .

dialogue type : s
E :  I think that 's the bad idea .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^fe
E :  Really .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  You 're gonna end up with all these little patchy things , whereas really what we want to do is have the the the bias towards letting it go .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  Because nob you

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  one or twi once or twice , in the re in the meetings we 've heard , where somebody said something that they might be embarrassed by ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but overall people are talking about technical topics .

dialogue type : s
E :  Nobody 's gonna get hurt .

dialogue type : s
E :  Nobody 's being l libeled .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  We 're playing the lawyer 's game , and we 're playing we 're we 're we 're looking for the extreme case .

dialogue type : s
E :  If we really orient it towards that extreme case , make it really easy , we 're gonna end up encouraging a headache .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  I 'm sort of psyching myself out here ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^nd.%-
E : 

dialogue type : %-
E :  but i

dialogue type : s^df
E :  And and it really depends on what kind of research you 're doing .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  I think some researchers who are gonna be working with this corpus years from now are really gonna be cursing the fact that there 's a bunch of stuff in there that 's missing from the dialogue .

dialogue type : s^r
E :  You know , it depends on the kind of research they 're doing ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but it might be , uh it might be really a a pain .

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  the one who said it or someone who is being spoken about , we definitely want to allow the option of it being bleeped out .

dialogue type : s
E :  But I really think we wanna make it the rare incidence .

dialogue type : s
E :  And and uh , I am just a little worried about making it so easy for people to do ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and so much fun ! that they 're gonna go through and bleep out stuff .

dialogue type : s
E :  and they can bleep out stuff they don't like too ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
E :  right

dialogue type : s
E :  from somebody else , as you say ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  you know , so " well I didn't like what he said . "

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bsc.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  You - you 've talked me into that ,

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  but I I just think that we should make it harder to do .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  So maybe you don't give them access to the web interface unless they really need it .

dialogue type : fg
E :  So so so

dialogue type : s^fa
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  so so So maybe this is a s a way out of it .

dialogue type : s
E :  You 've provided something that 's useful for you to do handle ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and useful for someone else if they need it .

dialogue type : s
E :  But I think the issue of privacy and ease and so forth should be that uh , they get access to this if they really need it .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
E :  W w

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : %-
E :  y

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  but you don't necessarily have to distribute passwords is what I 'm saying .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No , no , no .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  But we don't even necessarily need to end up distributing passwords at all .

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No , no .

dialogue type : s
E :  You 're missing the point .

dialogue type : s
E :  We 're We 're trying i We 're trying to make it less of an obvious just l l l l uh fall off a log , to do this .

dialogue type : qy^f^rt
E :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  not just for fun ,

dialogue type : qy^f
E :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
E :  but to to check this for uh things that they 're worried about having said or if they 're willing to just send an approval of it , at from their memory .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
E :  Um and , uh , and we should think carefully actually we should review go through how that 's worded ,

dialogue type : qy^f^rt
E :  OK ?

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  Then , if someone uh wants to review it , uh ,

dialogue type : s^df|s^cs
E :  and I know you don't like this , but I 'm offering this as a suggestion , is that is that we then give them a print out .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^aap|s^arp.%-
E :  I know you 'd prefer it , but the proble

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  there 's a problem with it .

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  Well you can go too far in that direction , and you need to find somewhere between I think ,

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  Having access to it doesn't necessarily mean , that having it

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
E :  right ?

dialogue type : s
E :  It just means they have the right to have it .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Um . Yeah , I mean I don't wanna fool them ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I just meant that e every ev any time you say anything to anyone there is in fact a a bias that is presented ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
E :  right ?

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  Yeah , uh no that it tha

dialogue type : b
E :  that 's right .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah , OK ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  so . wh um I think I have an idea that may be sat may satisfy both you and me in this which is , um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  it 's a it we just go over carefully how these notes to people are worded .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  So I I just want it to be worded in such a way where it gives the strong impre it gives very , I mean nothing hidden , v very strongly the bias that we would really like to use all of these data .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  That that we really would rather it wasn't a patchwork of things tossed out ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  that it would be better for , um , our , uh , field if that is the case .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : sj
E :  And I don't think there 's anything in the legal aspects that that is hurt by our expressing that bias .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  See I 'm @ @ worried about this interface so much fun that people start bleeping stuff out just as just because they can .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
E :  Well I don't know .

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  I kind of had fun when you played me something that was bleeped out .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
E :  You know .

dialogue type : %--
E :  I

dialogue type : qy^bh
E :  Oh they won't ?

dialogue type : sj^ba
