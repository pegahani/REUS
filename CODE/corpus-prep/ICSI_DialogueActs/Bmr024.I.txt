dialogue type : qy
I :  You mean there 're more than ten ?

dialogue type : h|s
I :  Well , I can stay till about , uh , three forty .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : h|s^aa
I :  Well , yeah .

dialogue type : s
I :  So this is just partly to inform everybody , um , and and of course to get , um , input .

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  Um , so , uh , we had a discussion Don and Liz and I had discussion last week about how to proceed with , uh , you know , with Don 's work ,

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
I :  and and and , uh , one of the obvious things that occur to us was that we 're since we now have Thilo 's segmenter and it works , you know , amazingly well , um , we should actually basically re - evaluate the recognition , um , results using you know , without cheating on the segmentations .

dialogue type : s.%-
I : 

dialogue type : s^bk
I :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : qw
I :  Why do you ask ?

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  No , actually , um , NIST has , um m a fairly sophisticated scoring program that you can give a , um a time ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
I :  uh You know , you basically just give two time - marked sequences of words , and it computes the um the , uh you know , the the th

dialogue type : s^m^na
I :  it does all the work for you .

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  So , it we just and we use that actually in Hub - five to do the scoring .

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  Um . So what we 've been using so far was sort of a simplified version of the scoring .

dialogue type : s
I :  And we can we can handle the the the type of problem we have here .

dialogue type : s.%-
I :  So , we ha

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
I :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
I :  So do

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : s
I :  It does time - constrained word - alignment .

dialogue type : fh
I :  So .

dialogue type : s
I :  So that should be possible .

dialogue type : s
I :  I mean that shouldn't be a problem .

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  Uh , so that was the one thing ,

dialogue type : s.%--
I :  and the other was that ,

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : qw
I :  What was the other problem ?

dialogue type : sj^fe
I :  Oh !

dialogue type : s
I :  That Thilo wanted to use the recognizer alignments to train up his , um , speech detector .

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  Um , so that we could use , uh you know there wouldn't be so much hand labelling needed to , uh to generate training data for for the speech detector .

dialogue type : s
I :  And I think you 're in the process of doing that .

dialogue type : s.%-
I : 

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : s
I :  That won't be perfect the alignments aren't perfect ,

I :  Porzel .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : sj
I :  I dunno who came up with it , but I think it 's a really clever idea .

dialogue type : s^cs
I :  We simulate a computer breakdown halfway through the session , and so then after that , the person 's told that they 're now talking to a , uh to a human .

dialogue type : s
I :  So , we we collect we collect both human - computer and human - human data , essentially , in the same session .

dialogue type : s^na
I :  That 's an idea .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %
I :  O

dialogue type : s^cs
I :  Just just reboot it .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^fe.%
I :  Wow .

dialogue type : qr^d
I :  No , the the question is do we save one or two far - field channels or all of them ?

dialogue type : b.%
I :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b.%
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
I :  It 's to be traini to b training data and development data for the SmartKom system .

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
I :  We weren't supposed to collect any data .

dialogue type : s.%-
I : 

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
I :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
I :  Well , it it makes sense to handle it with the same infrastructure , since we don't want to duplicate things unnecessarily .

dialogue type : s^cs
I :  But as far as distributing it , we shouldn't label it as part of this meeting corpus .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
I :  We should let it be its own corp

dialogue type : s
I :  It might also be potentially confusing .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
I :  Yeah , I th

dialogue type : b.%
I :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
I :  That 's a that 's another argument to keep it separate ,

dialogue type : s^df
I :  because it 's gonna follow the SmartKom transcription conventions and not the ICSI meeting transcription conventions .

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  Exactly .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^t3

dialogue type : qy^t3
I :  Do you wanna be a subject ?

dialogue type : %--
I : 

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
I :  That was one of our concerns .

dialogue type : %--
I : 

dialogue type : s^cs
I :  I shouldn't be saying this , but , you can just you know , since the back - ups are every night , you can recycle the backed - up diskspace .

dialogue type : s^j
I :  I didn't say that .

dialogue type : s^r.%
I :  I didn't say that .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
I :  Well , I think I think there 's an argument for having you know , you could use our old file server for for disks that have data that is very rarely accessed ,

dialogue type : s^cs
I :  and then have a fast new file server for data that is , um , heavily accessed .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na.%--
I :  It 's the back it 's the back - up capaci

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
I :  I mean , I think I think we 've raised this before and someone said this is not a reliable way to do it ,

dialogue type : %--
I : 

dialogue type : qw^cs
I :  What about putting the stuff on , like , C - CD - ROM or DVD or something ?

dialogue type : s^bk
I :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
I :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
I :  But they wear out just from sitting on the shelf ?

dialogue type : qrr
I :  Or from being read and read ?

dialogue type : s^bk
I :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
I :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : %--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  then you would think you 'd hear much more clamoring about data loss

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : s.%-
I : 

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mmm .

dialogue type : qw.%-
I :  So how about ?

dialogue type : fg|qw^cs
I :  So so how about putting them on that plus , like on a on on DAT or some other medium that isn't risky ?

dialogue type : s^bk
I :  OK .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  Say , they actually last , like , five years , huh , in in the typical case ,

dialogue type : s
I :  and and occasionally you might need to recreate one ,

dialogue type : s
I :  and then you get your tape out , but otherwise you don't .

dialogue type : qy.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s.%--
I :  you just put them on ?

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
I :  It 's like like dynamic ra DRAM .

dialogue type : s
I :  One one thing I don't understand is , if you have the data if if you if the meeting data is put on disk exactly once , then it 's backed - up once and the back - up system should never have to bother with it , uh , more than once .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
I :  But but this back - up system is smart enough to figure out that something hasn't changed and doesn't need to be backed - up again .

dialogue type : fg
I :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
I : 

dialogue type : s^bk
I :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
I :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
I :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^cs.%-
I :  So , what if we buy , uh uh , what what do they call these , um high density ?

dialogue type : s^ar
I :  No , no .

dialogue type : s^df^nd
I :  Because this is maybe something that we can do without involving Dave , and and , putting more burden on him .

dialogue type : qw^cs
I :  How about we buy , uh uh uh , one of these high density tape drives ?

dialogue type : s^cs
I :  And we put the data actually on non - backed - up disks .

dialogue type : s^cs
I :  And we do our own back - up once and for all all , and then and we don't have to bother this @ @ up ?

dialogue type : s
I : 

dialogue type : fh
I :  uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s^no
I :  I dunno .

dialogue type : qw
I :  What kind of tape drive is it ?

dialogue type : qy.%-
I :  Is it is ?

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : s
I :  But it might interfere with their back - up schedule ,

dialogue type : b
I :  eh .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^2^na
I :  On an XH uh , X X whatever partition .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  OK .

dialogue type : s^nd
I :  Yeah , but then you 're effectively using the resources of the back - up system .

dialogue type : qy
I :  Or is that a different tape robot ?

dialogue type : fg
I :  No , no .

dialogue type : %-
I : 

dialogue type : s.%-
I :  Yeah , just give a dedi

dialogue type : fg|s
I :  Well , I 'm saying is @ @ i if you go to Dave , and and and ask him " can I use your tape robot ? " ,

dialogue type : s
I :  he will say , " well that 's gonna screw up our back - up operation . "

dialogue type : s^bk
I :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
I :  Alright .

dialogue type : b
I :  Alright .

dialogue type : sj^ba
I :  Good .

dialogue type : s^ng
I :  Well , it if he you have to put the data on a on a non - backed - up disk to begin with .

dialogue type : s.%-
I : 

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  OK .

dialogue type : b
I :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^d
I :  SRI recognition ?

dialogue type : s^bk
I :  Oh .

dialogue type : fg
I :  Um . well ,

dialogue type : s
I :  we have lots of them .

dialogue type : fh|s^no
I :  Uh , I dunno .

dialogue type : qy^rt
I :  Chuck , do you have any any updates ?

dialogue type : b
I :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^co
I :  Well , you have to sa you have to tell people that you 're you 're doing you 're trying the tandem features .

dialogue type : s
I :  A and I 'm still tinkering with the PLP features .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aap
I :  That was that was before I tried it on the females .

dialogue type : s^j
I :  See , women are nothi are , trouble .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^j^rt
I :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^j
I :  As we all know .

dialogue type : fh
I :  So .

dialogue type : s.%-
I :  So so , when So I I had I ha

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  we had reached the point where , um , on the male portion of the development set , the , um or one of the development sets , I should say the , um the male error rate with , uh , ICSI PLP features was pretty much identical with , uh , SRI features .

dialogue type : s
I :  which are MFCC .

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  So , um , then I thought , " Oh , great .

dialogue type : s^rt
I :  I 'll j I 'll just let 's make sure everything works on the females . "

dialogue type : s
I :  And the error rate you know , there was a three percent difference .

dialogue type : fh
I :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : s^ar
I :  No , actually there 's more training data .

dialogue type : s^ar
I :  No , no .

dialogue type : s
I :  This is Hub - five .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
I :  Um , and the test data is CallHome and Switchboard .

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  Oh , and plus the the vocal tract length normalization didn't actually made things worse .

dialogue type : s
I :  So something 's really seriously wrong .

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  That 's true .

dialogue type : s^bk
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
I : 

dialogue type : fg
I : 

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  So , most most Hub - five systems actually band - limit the uh , at about , uh , thirty - seven hundred , um , hertz .

dialogue type : s
I :  Although , you know , normally , I mean , the channel goes to four four thousand .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
I :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  And that actually helped , uh uh , a little bit .

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  Um and it didn't hurt on the males either .

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  Oh , and suddenly , also the v the vocal tract length normalization only in the test se on the test data .

dialogue type : s
I :  So , you can do vocal tract length normalization on the test data only or on both the training and the test .

dialogue type : s
I :  And you expect it to help a little bit if you do it only on the test , and s more if you do it on both training and test .

dialogue type : s
I :  And so the It now helps , if you do it only on the test ,

dialogue type : s
I :  and I 'm currently retraining another set of models where it 's both in the training and the test ,

dialogue type : s
I :  and then we 'll we 'll have , hopefully , even better results .

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  It looks like there will still be some difference ,

dialogue type : s
I :  maybe between one and two percent , um , for the females .

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  And so , um , you know , I 'm open to suggestions .

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : %--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  it can't be just the VTL ,

dialogue type : s^df
I :  because if you don't do VTL in both systems , uh , you know , the the females are considerably worse in the with the PLP features .

dialogue type : s
I :  So there must be some something else going on .

dialogue type : h|s^aap
I :  Um , that ye overall , yes ,

dialogue type : s^arp
I :  but on this particular development test set , they 're actually a little worse .

dialogue type : s^nd
I :  But that 's beside the point .

dialogue type : s
I :  We 're looking at the discrepancy between the SRI system and the SRI system when trained with ICSI features .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
I :  It 's Baum - Welch training .

dialogue type : h
I : 

dialogue type : h|s
I :  Well , actually , we we just basically do a s a fixed number of iterations .

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  Uh , in this case four .

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  Um , which Eh , we used to do only three ,

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  And it was basically , we 're s we 're keeping it on the safe side .

dialogue type : s.%--
I :  But you 're d

dialogue type : fh
I :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
I :  It might be that one more iteration would would help , but it 's sort of

dialogue type : fh
I :  you know .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
I :  No , but with Baum - Welch , there shouldn't be an over - fitting issue , really .

dialogue type : fg
I :  Um .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
I :  Well , yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  Well , that 's that 's the easy one to check ,

dialogue type : s
I :  because we save all the intermediate models

dialogue type : s.%-
I : 

dialogue type : h|s
I :  Um I uh I 'm actually re - optimizing them .

dialogue type : s
I :  Although that hasn't shown to make a big difference .

dialogue type : qy.%-
I :  Pruning ?

dialogue type : qy.%-
I :  Pruning in the ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
I :  I you mean did you see this in the SRI system ?

dialogue type : h|s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  You can't directly compare them , because , for every set of models you compute a new normalization .

dialogue type : s
I :  And so these log probabilities , they aren't directly comparable

dialogue type : s^df
I :  because you have a different normalization constants for each model you train .

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  W yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  We prune very conservatively .

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  So we we basically we have a very open beam .

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Course .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : s^arp
I :  Actually , there is the difference in that .

dialogue type : s
I :  So , for the PLP features we use the triangular filter shapes .

dialogue type : s
I :  And for the in the SRI front - end we use the trapezoidal one .

dialogue type : s
I :  Well , now it 's the same .

dialogue type : s
I :  It 's thirty thirty to seven hundred and sixty hertz .

dialogue type : s^ar
I :  No , no .

dialogue type : %-
I : 

dialogue type : fg
I : 

dialogue type : fg
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  Since currently the Feacalc program doesn't allow me to change the filter shape independently of the scale .

dialogue type : s
I :  And , I did the experiment on the SRI front - end where I tried the y where the standard used to be to use trapezoidal filters .

dialogue type : s
I :  You can actually continuously vary it between the two .

dialogue type : s
I :  And so I wen I swi I tried the trap eh , triangular ones .

dialogue type : s
I :  And it did slightly worse , but it 's really a small difference .

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  Yeah , exactly .

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  I don't think the filter shape by itself will make a huge difference .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
I :  OK .

dialogue type : s
I :  So one thing I haven't done yet is to actually do all of this with a much larger with our full training set .

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
I :  forty ?

dialogue type : s
I :  I i it 's it 's eh it 's a f training set that 's about , um , you know , by a factor of four smaller than what we use when we train the full system .

dialogue type : s
I :  So , some of these smoothing issues are over - fitting for that matter .

dialogue type : s
I :  And the Baum - Welch should be much less of a factor , if you go full whole hog .

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  And so , w so , just um so the strategy is to first sort of treat things with fast turn - around on a smaller training set and then , when you 've sort of , narrowed it down , you try it on a larger training set .

dialogue type : s
I :  And so , we haven't done that yet .

dialogue type : s
I :  Th - th the boot models are trained from scratch .

dialogue type : s.%--
I :  So we compute ,

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  So , we start with a , um , alil alignment that we computed with the b sort of the best system we have .

dialogue type : s
I :  And and then we train from scratch .

dialogue type : s
I :  So we com we do a , you know , w um We collect the uh , the observations from those alignments under each of the feature sets that that we train .

dialogue type : s.%--
I :  And then , from there we do ,

dialogue type : fh
I : 

dialogue type : s.%--
I :  There 's a lot of ,

dialogue type : s
I :  actually The way it works , you first train a phonetically - tied mixture model .

dialogue type : fh
I :  Um .

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  First you do a context - independent PTM model .

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : s
I :  You do two iterations of that .

dialogue type : s
I :  Then you do two iterations of of of context - dependent phonetically - tied mixtures .

dialogue type : s
I :  And then from that you you do the you you go to a state - clustered model ,

dialogue type : s
I :  and you do four iterations of that .

dialogue type : s
I :  So there 's a lot of iterations overall between your original boot models and the final models .

dialogue type : s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : fh
I :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
I :  We have never seen big differences .

dialogue type : s
I :  Once I thought " oh , I can Now I have these much better models .

dialogue type : s
I :  I 'll re - generate my initial alignments .

dialogue type : s
I :  Then I 'll get much better models at the end . "

dialogue type : s
I :  Made no difference whatsoever .

dialogue type : s.%--
I :  It 's I think it 's eh , i

dialogue type : s.%-
I :  the boot models are recur

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^nd
I :  But there are no boot models , in fact .

dialogue type : s
I :  You you 're not booting from initial models .

dialogue type : s
I :  You 're booting from initial alignments .

dialogue type : s^aa
I :  That 's correct .

dialogue type : s.%-
I : 

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
I : 

dialogue type : fh|s
I :  So , we e w f w For a long time we had used boot alignments that had been trained with a with the same front - end but with acoustic models that were , like , fifteen percent worse than what we use now .

dialogue type : s
I :  And with a dict different dictionary with a considerably different dictionary , which was much less detailed and much less well - suited .

dialogue type : s
I :  And so , then we switched to new boot alignments ,

dialogue type : s
I :  which which now had the benefit of all these improvements that we 've made over two years in the system .

dialogue type : s
I :  And , the result in the end was no different .

dialogue type : s
I :  So , what I 'm saying is , the exact nature of these boot alignments is probably not a big factor in the quality of the final models .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
I :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^cc
I :  Anyway , I I I should really reserve , uh , any conclusions until we 've done it on the large training set , um , and until we 've seen the results with the with the VTL in training .

dialogue type : fh
I :  So .

dialogue type : b
I :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
I :  Right .

dialogue type : s
I :  And , uh , with this , I have to leave .

dialogue type : s
I :  With this said .

dialogue type : b
I :  Oh .

dialogue type : sj^fe
I :  Oh !

dialogue type : sj^ba
I :  Cool .

dialogue type : b
