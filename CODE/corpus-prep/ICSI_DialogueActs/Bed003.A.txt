A :  to to handle .

dialogue type : z
A :  I 'm

dialogue type : z
A :  in control here .

dialogue type : s
A :  But if you really want to find out what it 's about you have to click on the little light bulb .

dialogue type : s
A :  It opens the Assistant that tells you that the font type is too small .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Do you wanna try ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^co
A :  Continue .

dialogue type : qw
A :  Why are you doing this in this mode and not in the presentation mode ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh ! OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Of course .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No , It 's OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's It 'll work .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
A :  Appreciate it .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well there there is a term that 's often used .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  That 's " saliency " , or the " salience " of an object .

dialogue type : s
A :  And I was just wondering whether that 's the same as what you describe as " landmark - iness " .

dialogue type : s
A :  But it 's really not .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean an object can be very salient

dialogue type : s^2
A :  but not a landmark at all .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  Or it can be als

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  No one knows it .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  They 're they 're are a couple of more things .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I mean Uh . I would actually suggest we go through this one more time so we we all uh , agree on what what the meaning of these things is at the moment

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw^rt.%--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  The landmark is facing to the tourists .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  That 's because we 're talking about landmarks as touristic landmarks

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  not as possible um

dialogue type : s^2
A :  navigational landmarks

dialogue type : fh
A :  so

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa.%
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  Whatever granularity .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  that 's very nice ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
A :  huh ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  The the So the context is a switch between tourist or non - tourist ?

dialogue type : qrr
A :  Or also unknown ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  So , the the middle layer is also binary ?

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  No .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  But all those things without question marks are also binary .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  Nice walls ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I I gotcha .

dialogue type : s
A :  So we can either be in a hurry or not ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  but we cannot be in a medium hurry at the moment ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
A :  well the the sort of the landmark is is sort of the object

dialogue type : qy^d^g
A :  right ?

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  the argument in a sense ?

dialogue type : s
A :  that 's always warping on something some entity ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  and um Uh maybe at this stage we will we do want to uh sort of get uh modifiers in there

dialogue type : s
A :  because they may also tell us whether the person is in a hurry or not

dialogue type : s.%--:qw
A :  what 's the fastest way

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No ,

dialogue type : s
A :  then it wouldn't be a demo

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I was just gonna s

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  but it it

dialogue type : s
A :  However you know , it The purpose was not really , at this stage , to come up with meaningful probabilities

dialogue type : s
A :  but to get thinking about that hidden middle layer .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  And so th

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So if you run out of cash as a tourist , and and and you need to go to the AT

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s:qw
A :  " How do I get to the bank ? "

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  We - what set the they set the context to " unknown " ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  And if we now do leave everything else as is the results should be the same ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  Pretty much the same ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qh^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qy^rt.%--
A :  Can we ,

dialogue type : fh|qw^rt
A :  um How long would it take to to add another node on the observatory and , um , play around with it ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Let 's just say make it really simple .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  So th some things can be landmarks in your sense

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  but they can never be entered ?

dialogue type : s
A :  So for example s a statue .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
A :  So maybe we wanna have " landmark " meaning now " enterable landmark " versus , um something that 's simply just a vista point , for example .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : h|s
A :  Well , for example , if we include that ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  yeah ?

dialogue type : s
A :  um , accessibility or something ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  yeah ?

dialogue type : qy
A :  " Is it Can it be entered ? "

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  then of course , this is sort of binary as well .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then um , there 's also the question whether it may be entered .

dialogue type : s
A :  In the sense that , you know , if it 's Tom the house of Tom Cruise , you know , it 's enterable but you may not enter it .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  You know ?

dialogue type : s
A :  You 're not allowed to .

dialogue type : s
A :  Unless you are , whatever , his his divorce lawyer or something .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  and um And these are very observable sort of from the from the ontology sort of things .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  y y If If you 're running an errand you maybe more likely to be able to enter places that are usually not al w you 're not usually not allowed to uh m

dialogue type : s^co
A :  Let 's get this uh b clearer .

dialogue type : s
A :  S so it 's matrix between if it 's not enterable ,

dialogue type : s
A :  period .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  exactly .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  This is sort of uh

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qw.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  we have an object type statue .

dialogue type : s
A :  That really is an object type .

dialogue type : s
A :  So there is there 's gonna be a bunch of statues .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  And then we have , for example , an object type , hmm , that 's a hotel .

dialogue type : qw
A :  How about hotels ?

dialogue type : s
A :  So , the most famous building in Heidelberg is actually a hotel .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's the hotel Zum Ritter ,

dialogue type : s
A :  which is the only Renaissance building in Heidelberg that was left after the big destruction and for the Thirty Years War , blah - blah - blah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  It has wonderful walls .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um - And lots of detail , c and carvings , engravings and so forth ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : s
A :  But , um , it 's still an unlikely candidate for the Tango mode I must say .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  But . Um . So s So if you are a d

dialogue type : s
A :  Well it 's very tricky .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I guess your question is so far I have no really arg no real argument why to differentiate between statues as statues and houses of celebrities ,

dialogue type : s
A :  from that point of view .

dialogue type : b
A :  Huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Can we add , just so I can see how it 's done , uh , a " has door " property

dialogue type : qrr.%--
A :  or ?

dialogue type : h|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
A :  Oh actually it 's it it wouldn't affect any of our nodes ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Oh it 's it affects th The " doing business " is certainly not .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  It should , um , inhibit that ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
A :  right ?

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^co
A :  so just dis dismiss everything .

dialogue type : s^co
A :  Close it and and load up the old state so it doesn't screw screw that up .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
A :  Maybe you can read in ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Command line .

dialogue type : qw
A :  What is the c code ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Can w can we see that ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  How do you write the code

dialogue type : qrr
A :  or do you actually never have to write any code there ?

dialogue type : s^t1.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^co^rt
A :  Go Right mouse .

dialogue type : s^co^rt
A :  Open with .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
A :  Through the old Notepad .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's my favorite editor .

dialogue type : qy^br^rt
A :  Wordpad ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  So this is sort of LISP - y ?

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^am
A :  And that might do .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Do you have the true source files

dialogue type : qrr
A :  or just the class ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean it just reads this ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s
A :  When it starts .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  OK , wonderful .

dialogue type : qy^rt^tc
A :  So you got more slides ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Good .

dialogue type : fg
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa^m
A :  It 's like yawning .

dialogue type : s
A :  And this announcement was in stereo .

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : sj.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  is that maybe we ob we could observe a couple of um discourse phenomena such as the admission fee ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and something else and something else , that happened in the discourse before .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  And um let 's make those four .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  So maybe this could be sort of a separate region of the net , which has two has it 's own middle layer .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  Maybe this , you know , has some kind of um , funky thing that di

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  if this

dialogue type : s
A :  and this may influence these hidden nodes of the discourse

dialogue type : s
A :  which is maybe something that is uh , a more general version of the actual phenomenon that you can observe .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bu.%-:s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A :  uh uh d

dialogue type : qy^bh
A :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : fg
A :  Exactly .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  And then maybe there are some discourse acts if they happened before ,

dialogue type : s
A :  um it 's more for um a cue that the person actually wants to get somewhere else

dialogue type : s
A :  and that you are in a in a in a route

dialogue type : s
A :  um , sort of proceeding past these things ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so this would be just something that where you want to pass it .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : qy^d^g
A :  Is that it ?

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  However these are of course then

dialogue type : s
A :  the the nodes , the observed nodes , for your middle layer .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  So this again points to " final destination " , " doing business " , " tourist hurry " and so forth .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s:s
A :  And so then we can say , " OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  we have a whole region " in a e

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah , exactly .

dialogue type : s
A :  And this is just then just one .

dialogue type : s
A :  So e because at the end the more we um add , you know , the more spider - web - ish it 's going to become in the middle and the more of hand editing .

dialogue type : sj
A :  It 's going to get very ugly .

dialogue type : s
A :  But with this way we could say " OK , these are the discourse phenomena .

dialogue type : s
A :  They ra may have there own hidden layer that points to some of the the real hidden layer , um or the general hidden layer .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the same we will be able to do for syntactic information ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  the verbs used , the object types used , modifiers .

dialogue type : s
A :  And maybe there 's a hidden layer for that .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so forth and so forth .

dialogue type : s
A :  Then we have context .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Precisely .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:qw
A :  And if it if you do it If you could connect it too hard you may get such phenomenon that like " So how much has it cost to enter ? "

dialogue type : s
A :  and the answer is two hundred fifty dollars ,

dialogue type : s:s
A :  and then the persons says um " Yeah I want to see it . "

dialogue type : qy^d^g
A :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s:s
A :  meaning " It 's way out of my budget "

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : h|s^ar
A :  Um , nothing comes to mind .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  Without thinking too hard .

dialogue type : s^am.%--
A :  Um , maybe ,

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  yeah of course ,

dialogue type : s
A :  um opera premiers .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So you know .

dialogue type : s
A :  Or or any good old Pink Floyd concert .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I think that the h I mean nothing beats the the admission charge prices in Japan .

dialogue type : s
A :  So there , two hundred dollars is is moderate for getting into a discotheque .

dialogue type : s^d^f
A :  You know .

dialogue type : s
A :  Then again , everything else is free then once you 're ins in there .

dialogue type : s
A :  Food and drink and so forth .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So . I mean .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  um , you know , um still , based on that result is never going to enter that building .

dialogue type : s^f
A :  You know ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Because it 's just too expensive .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  It works like this .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  The uh , um I mean .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  The first thing we get is that already the intention is sort of t

dialogue type : s
A :  They tried to figure out the intention ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s
A :  simply by parsing it .

dialogue type : s
A :  And this um m won't differentiate between all modes ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  yeah ?

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  somebody that wants to go someplace ,

dialogue type : s
A :  now it 's up for us to figure out what kind of going there is is is happening ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  and um , if the discourse takes a couple of turns before everything all the information is needed ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  what happens is you know the parser parses it

dialogue type : s
A :  and then it 's handed on to the discourse history which is , um o one of the most elaborate elaborate modules .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's it 's actually the the whole memory of the entire system , that knows what wh who said what , which was what was presented .

dialogue type : s
A :  It helps an an anaphora resolution and it and it fills in all the structures that are omitted ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  so , um ,

dialogue type : s:qw
A :  because you say " OK , how can I get to the castle ?

dialogue type : s:qw
A :  " Oh , how how much is it ? "

dialogue type : s:s
A :  and um " yeah I would like uh um to g let 's do it " and so forth .

dialogue type : s
A :  So even without an a ana anaphora somebody has to make sure that information we had earlier on is still here .

dialogue type : s
A :  Because not every module keeps a memory of everything that happened .

dialogue type : s
A :  so whenever the uh , um person is not actually rejecting what happened before ,

dialogue type : s:s
A :  so as in " No I really don't want to see that movie .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  I 'd rather stay home and watch TV "

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um What movie was selected in what cinema in what town is is going to be sort of added into the disc into the representations every di at each dialogue step , by the discourse model discourse model ,

dialogue type : s^t1
A :  Yeah , that 's what it 's called .

dialogue type : s^t1
A :  and , um , it does some help in the anaphora resolution

dialogue type : s
A :  and it also helps in coordinating the gesture screen issues .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So a person pointing to something on the screen , you know ,

dialogue type : s
A :  the discourse model actually stores what was presented at what location on the s on the screen

dialogue type : s
A :  so it 's a it 's a rather huge huge thing

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  It has a very clear interface .

dialogue type : s
A :  We can query it whether admission fees were discussed in the last turn

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  and and the turn before that or you know

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  how deep we want to search

dialogue type : s
A :  um which is a question .

dialogue type : qh
A :  How deep do we want to sear ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  you know ?

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um but we should try to keep in mind that , you know , we 're doing this sort of for research ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so we we should find a limit that 's reasonable and not go , you know , all the way back to Adam and Eve .

dialogue type : qh
A :  You know , did that person ever discuss admissions fee fees in his entire life ?

dialogue type : sj
A :  And the dialogues are pretty pretty you know concise

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  Anyway .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  I mean the u u

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  It 's in the these these these plan schemas .

dialogue type : sj
A :  I mean there are some some of them are extremely elaborate ,

dialogue type : s^f
A :  you know .

dialogue type : qh
A :  " What do you need need to buy a ticket ? "

dialogue type : s^f
A :  You know ?

dialogue type : s
A :  and it it 's fifty steps ,

dialogue type : b
A :  huh ?

dialogue type : s
A :  just for buying a ticket at a ticket counter ,

dialogue type : s
A :  you know , and and maybe that 's helpful to look at it to look at those .

dialogue type : sj
A :  It 's amazing what human beings can do .

dialogue type : s
A :  W when we talked uh we had the example , you know , of you being uh a s a person on a ticket counter working at railway station

dialogue type : s:s
A :  and somebody r runs up to you with a suitcase in his hands , says New York

dialogue type : s
A :  and you say Track seven ,

dialogue type : qh^rt
A :  huh ?

dialogue type : s
A :  And it 's because you know that that person actually is following , you know You execute a whole plan of going through a hundred and fifty steps , you know , without any information other than " New York " ,

dialogue type : b
A :  huh ?

dialogue type : s
A :  inferring everything from the context .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So , works .

dialogue type : s
A :  Um , even though there is probably no train from here to New York ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  right ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  But uh it 's possible .

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  Um , no you probably have to transfer also somewhere else .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
A :  Is that t San Francisco , Chicago ?

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  Is that possible ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well it never went all the way ,

dialogue type : qy
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean you always had to change trains at Omaha ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  One track ended there and the other one started at five meters away from that

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qy^d^g
A :  yeah ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Has anybody ever been on an Amtrak ?

dialogue type : s^e
A :  Their reputation is very bad .

dialogue type : b
A :  huh ?

dialogue type : s^am
A :  It 's not maybe reality .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  But you know , I don't know whether it 's which ones are safer , you know , statistically .

dialogue type : s^aa^m
A :  Much faster .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  yeah I used um Amtrak quite a bit on the east coast

dialogue type : s
A :  and I was surprised .

dialogue type : s
A :  It was actually OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  You know , on Boston New York ,

dialogue type : s
A :  New York Rhode Island ,

dialogue type : s
A :  whatever ,

dialogue type : s
A :  Boston .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's a different issue .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s
A :  I think that um What you guys did is really nicely sketching out different tasks , and maybe some of their conditions .

dialogue type : s
A :  One task is more likely you 're in a hurry when you do that kind of s doing business ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and and less in a hurry when uh you 're a tourist

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um tourists may have never have final destinations , you know because they are eternally traveling around

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  so maybe what what what happened what might happen is that we do get this sort of task - based middle layer ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and then we 'll get these sub - middle layers , that are more cue - based .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  Nah ?

dialogue type : sj
A :  Might be might be a nice dichotomy of of the world .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  So , um I suggest w to for to proceed with this in in the sense that maybe throughout this week the three of us will will talk some more about maybe segmenting off different regions ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A : 

dialogue type : qy^rt.%-
A :  is that what th

A :  What 's the technical term ?

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  For the uh nodes that are observable ?

dialogue type : s^e
A :  The " outer layer " ?

dialogue type : s^cs
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Identify four regions ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  maybe make up some features for each region

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  middle layer for those .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then these should then connect somehow to the more plan - based deep space

dialogue type : s^df
A :  Yep . The - they they will be aud ad - hoc for for for some time to come .

dialogue type : s^bc
A :  The day after tomorrow .

dialogue type : s
A :  Wednesday .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Oh ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  isn't Ben ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Ben , then ,

dialogue type : s
A :  Ben .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  That will be one one thing we could do .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I actually uh , have Um ,

dialogue type : s
A :  also we can uh , start looking at the SmartKom tables

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I actually wanted to show that to you guys now

dialogue type : fh
A :  but um .

dialogue type : h|s^ar
A :  Um , no

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  I I actually made a mistake because it it fell asleep

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  and when Linux falls asleep on my machine it 's it doesn't wake up ever ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  so I had to reboot

dialogue type : s
A :  And if I reboot without a network , I will not be able to start SmartKom , because I need to have a network .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : h|s
A :  Um it looks up some stuff that , you know , is is that is in the written by the operating system only if it if you get a DHCP request ,

dialogue type : s
A :  so it you know , my computer does not know its IP address ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f
A :  you know ?

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  You know . So .

dialogue type : s
A :  Unless it boots up with networking .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  they don't know who localhost is , and so forth and so forth .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  Always fun .

dialogue type : s
A :  But it 's a , um , simple solution .

dialogue type : s
A :  We can just um , go downstairs and and and look at this ,

dialogue type : s^am
A :  but maybe not today .

dialogue type : h|s^t^tc.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^t1
A :  oh yeah ,

dialogue type : s^t
A :  OK , I have to report um , data collection .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  We interviewed Fey ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  She 's willing to do it ,

dialogue type : s
A :  meaning be the wizard for the data collection ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  also maybe transcribe a little bit , if she has to ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but also recruiting subjects , organizing them , and so forth .

dialogue type : sj^rt
A :  So that looks good .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  Jerry however suggested that we should uh have a trial run with her ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  see whether she can actually do all the uh spontaneous , eloquent and creativeness that we uh expect of the wizard .

dialogue type : s
A :  And I talked to Liz about this

dialogue type : s
A :  and it looks as if Friday afternoon will be the time when we have a first trial run for the data .

dialogue type : qw^br
A :  Pardon me ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Um Liz also volunteered to be the first subject , which I think might be even better than us guys .

dialogue type : s
A :  If we do need her for the technical stuff , then of course one of you has to sort of uh jump in .

dialogue type : h
A :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
A :  yes w we we would like to test the wizard ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  but you know , if we take a subject that is completely unfamiliar with the task , or any of the set up , we get a more realistic

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  experimental setup u on the technical issue

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  yes ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  except we st I think we still need uh a recording device for the wizard ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
A :  just a tape recorder that 's running in a room .

dialogue type : s
A :  But um in terms of specifying the scenario , um uh uh we 've gotten a little further

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
A :  but um we wanted to wait until we know who is the wizard ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and have the wizard partake in the ultimate sort of definition probe .

dialogue type : s
A :  So so if if on Friday it turns out that she really likes it and and we really like her , then nothing should stop us from sitting down next week and getting all the details completely figured out .

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : h|s.%--
A :  Mmm - yea - some .

dialogue type : s
A :  Bu - e e e I 'm even This this Tango , Enter , Vista is sort of , itself , an ad - hoc scenario .

dialogue type : s
A :  The the basic u um idea behind the uh data collection was the following .

dialogue type : s
A :  The data we get from Munich is very command line ,

dialogue type : s
A :  simple linguistic stuff .

dialogue type : s
A :  Hardly anything complicated .

dialogue type : s
A :  No metaphors whatsoever .

dialogue type : s
A :  Not a rich language .

dialogue type : s
A :  So we wanted just to collect data , to get that that that elicits more , uh , that elicits richer language .

dialogue type : s
A :  And we actually did not want to constrain it too much ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
A :  you know ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Just see what people say .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then maybe we 'll discover the phenomenon the phenomena that we want to solve , you know , with whatever engine we we come up with .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um . So this this this is a parallel track ,

dialogue type : s
A :  you know , there they hopefully meet ,

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  It should tell us , you know , what kind of phenomenon could occur ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  it should tell us also maybe something about the difference between people who think they speak to a computer versus people who think they speak to a human being

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  and the sort of differences there .

dialogue type : s
A :  So it may get us some more information on the human - machine pragmatics , um , that no one knows anything about , as of yesterday .

dialogue type : s
A :  And uh nothing has changed since then ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  so .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Uh . And secondly , now that of course we have sort of started to lick blood with this ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and especially since um Johno can't stop Tango - ing , we may actually include , you know , those those intentions .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A :  So now I think we should maybe have at least one navigational task with with sort of explicit uh

dialogue type : s^bsc
A :  not ex it 's implicit that the person wants to enter ,

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  and maybe some task where it 's more or less explicit

dialogue type : s^e
A :  that the person wants to take a picture ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  or see it or something .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that we can label it .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , that 's how we get a corpus that we can label .

dialogue type : s
A :  Whereas , you know , if we 'd just get data we 'd never know what they actually wanted ,

dialogue type : s
A :  we 'd get no cues .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^rt^tc
A :  That was that .

dialogue type : %-
A :  Ma

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Maybe we ought to switch off these things before we continue .
