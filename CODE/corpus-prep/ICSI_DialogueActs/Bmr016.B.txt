dialogue type : qh^cs
B :  What about putting a hyphen between the numbers in the group ?

dialogue type : fg|qw
B :  Hey Liz , What what do the groupings represent ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  You said there 's like ten different groupings ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qo.%--
B :  Are the patterns like are they based on anything or

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Mmm , oh , OK .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^j
B :  Like Adam ?

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Parallel .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  It 's the P - make of digit reading .

dialogue type : s
B :  I couldn't understand a single thing you guys were saying .

dialogue type : s
B :  Performance art .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's gonna require some coordination .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  It 's great for the Germans .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  So if there was a segment of speech this long

dialogue type : s^bu^na:s
B :  and oh and someone said " oh , " the whole thing was passed to the recognizer ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  That 's why there 's so many insertion errors ?

dialogue type : s^aap|s^aa
B :  Early on , yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So the idea is that you would take this big hunk where somebody 's only speaking a small amount in it ,

dialogue type : s^bu^e.%-
B :  and then try to figure out where they 're speaking based on the other peopl

dialogue type : s
B :  I thought we were just gonna move the boundaries in .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : qw
B :  So why do you want to do echo cancellation ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bu.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  So do sort of what he 's already what he 's trying to do .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK , I s I see .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think this also ties into one of the things that Jane is gonna talk about too .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  So the SRI front - end won't take a uh an an a large audio file name and then a a list of segments to chop out from that large audio file ?

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  They actually have to be chopped out already ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  I don't I don't think that 's really right .

dialogue type : fg|s^df^ng
B :  Yeah , you you can give Waves a start and an end time .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  And middle .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^df
B :  No , I I 'm not suggesting you load a long wave file ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I 'm just saying you give it a start and an end time .

dialogue type : s
B :  And it 'll just go and pull out that section .

dialogue type : s^fa
B :  I 'm I 'm sorry to interrupt

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  you could could I just back up a little bit

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So you 're doing these So the whole process is that the transcribers get the conversation

dialogue type : s^bu^e
B :  and they do their pass over it .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then when they 're finished with it , it comes to you ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and you begin these sanit these quality checks .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't remember .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qr
B :  So that was part of the spell - check , or was that that was after the spell - check ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  So then it just an ending curly brace there ,

dialogue type : qrr
B :  or is there something else in there .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , oh , oh .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  So on the m

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  on the middle t So , in the first case that gloss applies to the word to the left .

dialogue type : s^bu^e|qy^d^g
B :  But in the middle two Th - it 's not applying to anything , right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Right , I just meant the middle two ones ,

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Except for now !

dialogue type : s
B :  We 're gonna never recognize this meeting .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt:s
B :  That 's " eh " versus " ah " ?

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
B :  They were the Canadians , right ?

dialogue type : s^j
B :  Morgan can make a song out of it .

dialogue type : qw
B :  Where 's that ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Wait a minute ,

dialogue type : %-
B :  w s

dialogue type : qr
B :  Was that somewhere where they were gonna say " new speaker " or something ?

dialogue type : s
B :  There 's no tilde in front of it ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's just comment about what they said .

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  So they didn't mean " tickle " as in Elmo ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qw
B :  Add what , Liz ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  What are you saying ?

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  So how w there 'd be a problem for doing the language modeling then with our transcripts the way they are .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
B :  So there will be a " NUMS " tag on those lines ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Right . That would argue for changing the other ones to be " digits " or something .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  I suppose what you could do is just make sure that you get rid of everything that has " curly brace NUMS curly brace " .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : qw.%--
B :  So Liz , what does the recognizer do ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh ,

dialogue type : qw
B :  what does the SRI recognizer output for things like that ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  " seven point five " .

dialogue type : qy.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Right ,

dialogue type : s^bu^e
B :  the word " seven " ?

dialogue type : s^bu^e
B :  The number " seven " ?

dialogue type : s^m|s^bk
B :  The word " seven " , OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap^bc
B :  Two or more .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Two or more different functions .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah , so that has implications for your script .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So right now the what you 're doing is you 're taking the uh , the o original version

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
B :  and you 're sort of channelizing yourself , right ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  So I I th I think probably the way it 'll go is that , you know , when we make this first general version and then start working on the script , that script @ @ that will be ma you know primarily come from what you 've done , um , we 'll need to work on a channelized version of those originals .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so it should be pretty much identical to what you have

dialogue type : s
B :  t except for the one that they 've already tightened the boundaries on .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  So

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , and then probably what will happen is as the transcribers finish tightening more and more , you know , that original version will get updated

dialogue type : s
B :  and then we 'll rerun the script and produce better uh versions .

dialogue type : s
B :  But the I guess the ef the effect for you guys , because you 're pulling out the little wave forms into separate ones , that would mean these boundaries are constantly changing

dialogue type : s
B :  you 'd have to constantly re rerun that ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I can't think of any of the other ones .
