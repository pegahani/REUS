dialogue type : s
B :  But about the need for transcription ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^df^rt
B :  I mean , don't we didn't we previously decide that the IBM transcripts would have to be checked anyway and possibly augmented ?

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So , I think having a good tool is worth something no matter what .

dialogue type : qw
B :  So who 's gonna do that ?

dialogue type : qw^e
B :  Who 's gonna do forced alignment ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^e

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s
B :  It is useful to transcribe and then ultimately train models for things like breath ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and also laughter is very , very frequent and important to to model .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%-

dialogue type : s^nd.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  As as long as there is an indication that there was laughter somewhere between two words I think that 's sufficient ,

dialogue type : %-
B :  because

dialogue type : s
B :  actually the recognition of laughter once you kn um you know , is pretty good .

dialogue type : s
B :  So as long as you can stick a you know , a t a tag in there that that indicates that there was laughter ,

dialogue type : s
B :  that would probably be , uh , sufficient to train models .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , the thing that you is hard to deal with is whe when they speak while laughing .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  But , um , that 's not as frequent as just laughing between speaking ,

dialogue type : fh

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^m
B :  uh , mouth mouth stuff .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yeah . You ha Oh . And each of these words has a dedicated phone .

B :  So the so the the mouth noise , uh , word has just a single phone ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  um , that is for that .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  And the the pronun the pronunciations the pronunciations are l are somewhat non - standard .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  uh , it 's just a single , s uh , you know , a single phone in the pronunciation ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but it has a self - loop on it ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa^m
B :  r can go on forever .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's just a it 's just a word .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^t3
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk^t3
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
