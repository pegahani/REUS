dialogue type : s^rt^t
B :  So I guess this is more or less now just to get you up to date , Johno .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  This is what , uh ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  Eva , Bhaskara , and I did .

dialogue type : h|qw^rt
B :  Um . Why ?

dialogue type : h|s^ar
B :  Uh , no .

dialogue type : %--
B :  This is

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Ha !

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Very nice .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
B :  Um , so we thought that , We can write up uh , an element ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  and for each of the situation nodes that we observed in the Bayes - net ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  What 's the situation like at the entity that is mentioned ?

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  if we know anything about it ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Is it under construction ?

dialogue type : qrr^rt
B :  Or is it on fire or something happening to it ?

dialogue type : qrr^rt
B :  Or is it stable ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and so forth ,

dialogue type : s
B :  going all the way um , f through Parking , Location , Hotel , Car , Restroom , @ @ Riots , Fairs , Strikes , or Disasters .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  That 's basically just specifying the the input for the w what 's

dialogue type : h|s^df^rt
B :  Um . Just because it forces us to be specific about the values here ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  And , also , I mean , this is a what the input is going to be .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^cc.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s^df
B :  No , because I mean if we I mean we 're sure gonna interface to We 're gonna get an XML document from somewhere .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s:s
B :  And that XML document will say " We are able to We were able to observe that w the element , um , @ @ of the Location that the car is near . "

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So that 's gonna be Um .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  So this is just , again , a an XML schemata which defines a set of possible , uh , permissible XML structures ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which we view as input into the Bayes - net .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  Yea - Are you talking are you talking about the the structure ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  I mean when you observe a node .

dialogue type : b
B :  Um - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No , it 's certainly not this .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  Nuh .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  XSL . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That 's That 's no problem ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s:s
B :  What you want is You wanna say , " OK , give me the posterior probabilities of the Go - there node , when this is happening . "

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s:s
B :  When the person said this , the car is there , it 's raining , and this is happening .

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  And with this you can specify the what 's happening in the situation , and what 's happening with the user .

dialogue type : s
B :  So we get After we are done , through the Situation we get the User Vector .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  all the possible outputs , too .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  So , we have , um , for example , the , uh , Go - there decision node

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  which has two elements ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  going - there and its posterior probability ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  and not - going - there and its posterior probability ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because the output is always gonna be all the decision nodes and all the the a all the posterior probabilities for all the values .

dialogue type : h|s^aap
B :  Um , pretty much , yes ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but I think it 's a little bit more complex .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  As , if I understand it correctly , it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , when we input something , we always get the , uh , posterior probabilities for all of these .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So there is no way of telling it t not to tell us about the EVA values .

dialogue type : s
B :  So

dialogue type : s
B :  and the question is what to do with it ,

dialogue type : s
B :  what to hand on ,

dialogue type : s
B :  how to interpret it ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  in a sense .

dialogue type : s
B :  So y you said if you " I 'm only interested in whether he wants to go there or not " , then I just look at that node ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^m
B :  Look at that Struct in the the output ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  even though I wouldn't call it a " Struct " .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^aa
B :  Oh . Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  So every part of a structure is a " Struct " .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  That element or object , I would say .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Let 's look at an example .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yeah . w We 'd need to prune .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Throw things away .

dialogue type : %-
B :  No

dialogue type : s^aa|s:s
B :  Yeah , exactly . The @ @ Xerxes allows you to say , u " Just give me the value of that , and that , and that . "

dialogue type : s
B :  But , we don't really know what we 're interested in before we look at the complete at at the overall result .

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  So the person said , um , " Where is X ? "

dialogue type : fh
B :  and so ,

dialogue type : s:qy
B :  we want to know , um , is Does he want info ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  o on this ?

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  or know the location ?

dialogue type : s^e:qy
B :  Or does he want to go there ?

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Let 's assume this is our our question .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Nuh ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s^t1
B :  Do this in Perl .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Let 's assume this is the output .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean . It 's always gonna give us a value of how likely we think i it is that he wants to go there and doesn't want to go there ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  or how likely it is that he wants to get information .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  But , maybe w we should just reverse this to make it a little bit more delicate .

dialogue type : qr
B :  So , does he wanna know where it is ? or does he wanna go there ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  I I I tend to agree .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And i if there 's sort of a clear winner here ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
B :  and , um and this is pretty , uh indifferent ,

dialogue type : s
B :  then we then we might conclude that he actually wants to just know where , uh t uh , he does want to go there .

dialogue type : s^2:s
B :  Or Go - there .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  A lot of people ask that , if they actually just wanna go there .

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  People come up to you on campus and say , " Where 's the library ? "

dialogue type : s:s^co
B :  You 're gonna say y you 're gonna say , g " Go down that way . "

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  You 're not gonna say " It 's It 's five hundred yards away from you " or " It 's north of you " , or " it 's located "

dialogue type : h
B :  Um .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  I don't know whether I understand what you mean .

dialogue type : s^cs^t
B :  But . Again , in this Given this input , we , also in some situations , may wanna postulate an opinion whether that person wants to go there now

dialogue type : s^e
B :  the nicest way ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  use a cab ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  or so s

dialogue type : s
B :  wants to know it wants to know where it is because he wants something fixed there , because he wants to visit t it or whatever .

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  So , it n I mean a All I 'm saying is , whatever our input is , we 're always gonna get the full output .

dialogue type : s
B :  And some some things will always be sort of too not significant enough .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Oh !

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So , basically , the idea is to f to feed the output of that belief - net into another belief - net .

dialogue type : qw
B :  But , why why why only those three ?

dialogue type : qw.%-
B :  Why not the whol

dialogue type : s^arp.%--
B :  Yeah . But we believe that all the decision nodes are can be relevant for the Where - Is ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt:qw
B :  and the Where How - do - I - get - to

dialogue type : s^e
B :  or the Tell - me - something - about .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yes , it is allowed .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Let 's not forget we 're gonna get some very strong input from these sub dis from these discourse things ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s:s^co
B :  " Tell me the location of X . "

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Nuh ?

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  Or " Where is X located at ? "

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Nuh ?

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think it 's th called " the Crown " .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
B :  versus " the Sony " .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  The manufacturer .

dialogue type : %-
B :  You w

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  You 're on - line ?

dialogue type : s^t
B :  We 're discussing this .

dialogue type : fg
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Assume we have something coming in .

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  A person says , " Where is X ? " ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and we get a certain We have a Situation vector and a User vector and everything is fine ?

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s^co^rt
B :  let 's just assume our Bayes - net just has three decision nodes for the time being .

dialogue type : s
B :  These three , he wants to know something about it , he wants to know where it is , he wants to go there .

dialogue type : s^aap|%-
B :  Yeah , but , mmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  No , I can I can do the Timing node in here , too ,

dialogue type : s.%-:s
B :  and say " OK . "

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  OK , and ,

dialogue type : s
B :  Go - there has two values ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ? ,

dialogue type : s^rt:s
B :  Go - there and not - Go - there .

dialogue type : s^co^rt
B :  Let 's assume those are the posterior probabilities of that .

dialogue type : s
B :  Info - on has True or False and Location .

dialogue type : s
B :  So , he wants to know something about it ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and he wants to know something he wants to know Where - it - is ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  has these values .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  And , um , in this case we would probably all agree that he wants to go there .

dialogue type : s
B :  Our belief - net thinks he wants to go there ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  In the , uh , whatever ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  if we have something like this here ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and

dialogue type : s^e
B :  this like that

dialogue type : s^e.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  something like that ,

dialogue type : s
B :  then we would guess , " Aha ! He , our belief - net , has s stronger beliefs that he wants to know where it is , than actually wants to go there . "

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  What do you mean by " differently weighted " ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  They don't feed into anything really anymore .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Makes sense .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B :  Mmm ?

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  I don't see your point .

dialogue type : s
B :  What what what I am thinking , or what we 're about to propose here is we 're always gonna get the whole list of values and their posterior probabilities .

dialogue type : s
B :  And now we need an expert system or belief - net or something that interprets that ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  that looks at all the values and says , " The winner is Timing .

dialogue type : s:s^co
B :  Now , go there . "

dialogue type : s:s^co
B :  " Uh , go there , Timing , now . "

dialogue type : s^e:s
B :  Or , " The winner is Info - on , Function - Off . "

dialogue type : s^e
B :  So , he wants to know something about it , and what it does .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Nuh ?

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  Uh , regardless of of of the input . Wh - Regardle

dialogue type : s
B :  Based on the k what the question was , so what the discourse , the ontology , the situation and the user model gave us , we came up with these values for these decisions .

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : h|s^co
B :  Well , look at look Face yourself with this pr question .

dialogue type : s
B :  You get this You 'll have y This is what you get .

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  And now you have to make a decision . What do we think ?

dialogue type : qw
B :  What does this tell us ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  And not knowing what was asked , and what happened , and whether the person was a tourist or a local ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because all of these factors have presumably already gone into making these posterior probabilities .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-:s
B :  What what we need is a just a mechanism that says , " Aha ! There is "

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^df^e
B :  Because there are interdependencies ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Uh , no . So if if for example , the Go - there posterior possibility is so high , um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh , w if it 's if it has reached reached a certain height , then all of this becomes irrelevant .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : qy^2^bu^d^rt
B :  He wants to go there and know something about it ?

dialogue type : s^na
B :  I think to some extent they are .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Or maybe they 're not .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Well , if he doesn't want to go there , even if the Enter posterior proba

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  Go - there is No .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  Enter is High ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  and Info - on is High .

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
B :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No , there 's No .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^na.%--
B :  Yeah , I 'm also agreeing that a simple

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  pru Take the ones where we have a clear winner .

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  Forget about the ones where it 's all sort of middle ground .

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  Prune those out

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  and just hand over the ones where we have a winner .

dialogue type : s^ba^df
B :  Yeah , because that would be the easiest way .

dialogue type : s^cs:s^co
B :  We just compose as an output an XML mes message that says . " Go there now . " " Enter historical information . "

dialogue type : s
B :  And not care whether that 's consistent with anything .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  But in this case if we say , " definitely he doesn't want to go there . He just wants to know where it is . "

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  or let 's call this this " Look - At - H "

dialogue type : s
B :  He wants to know something about the history of .

dialogue type : s^e:s^co
B :  So he said , " Tell me something about the history of that . "

dialogue type : s
B :  Now , the e But for some reason the Endpoint - Approach gets a really high score , too .

dialogue type : s
B :  We can't expect this to be sort of at O point three , three , three , O point , three , three , three , O point , three , three , three .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Somebody needs to zap that .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  You know ?

dialogue type : s^e.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : fg|s^bs
B :  Yep . It 's sort of one of those , that 's It 's more like a decision tree , if if you want .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  You first look o at the lowball ones ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Um .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  Aren't we always computing all ?

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  Yeah , but that 's that 's just shifting the problem .

dialogue type : s^ng
B :  Then you would have to make a decision ,

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  " OK , if it 's a Where - Is question , which decision nodes do I query ? "

dialogue type : %-
B :  That 's un

dialogue type : s^arp
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah it 's it 's it 's apples and oranges .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Nuh ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance , computational time .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B :  So either you always have it compute all the posterior possibilities for all the values for all nodes , and then prune the ones you think that are irrelevant ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  or you just make a p @ @ a priori estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt
B :  Um , by the way , are Do we know whether Jerry and Nancy are coming ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
B :  Or ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK .

dialogue type : %--
B :  Because

dialogue type : s^bs^rt
B :  basically , what where we also have decided , prior to this meeting is that we would have a rerun of the three of us sitting together

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  sometime this week again

dialogue type : s^e^t
B :  and finish up the , uh , values of this .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  So we have , uh Believe it or not , we have all the bottom ones here .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
B :  We we we have Actually what we have is this line .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa^m
B :  Four .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
B :  And we have all the top ones ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  all the ones to which no arrows are pointing .

dialogue type : s
B :  What we 're missing are the these ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  where arrows are pointing ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  where we 're combining top ones .

dialogue type : s^co^rt
B :  So , we have to come up with values for this , and this , this , this , and so forth .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  And maybe just fiddle around with it a little bit more .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then it 's just , uh , edges ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  many of

dialogue type : s^r
B :  edges .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And , um , we won't meet next Monday .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  On on Friday .

dialogue type : s
B :  This this Friday .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
B :  This Friday .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
B :  Two weeks .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  Well , it 's a country .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  Buildings .

dialogue type : s^j^rt
B :  People .

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Vacation .

dialogue type : qy.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^t^tc
B :  Oh , yeah . So . Part of what we actually want to do is sort of schedule out what we want to surprise him with when when he comes back .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : qh^rt
B :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s
B :  You or have a finished construction parser and a working belief - net ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^j^na
B :  Well , that 's actually what I had planned , personally .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  I had I I had sort of scheduled out in my mind that you guys do a lot of work , and I do nothing .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  sort of bask in in your glory .

dialogue type : qy
B :  But , uh , i do you guys have any vacation plans ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because I myself am going to be , um , gone ,

dialogue type : s^bd
B :  but this is actually not really important .

dialogue type : s
B :  Just this weekend we 're going camping .

dialogue type : b
B :  Ah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  But we 're all going to be here on Tuesday again ?

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  Looks like it ?

dialogue type : s^co^rt
B :  OK , then . Let 's meet meet again next Tuesday .

dialogue type : fh|s^e^t
B :  And , um , finish up this Bayes - net .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  and that 's going to be more just you and me ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B :  because Bhaskara is doing probabilistic , recursive , structured , object - oriented , uh ,

dialogue type : s^bc
B :  reasoning machines .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : h
B :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
B :  The whole group .

dialogue type : s^cc^e
B :  And we present our results ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  our final ,

dialogue type : s^e
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^co
B :  Yeah . We should do this th the upcoming days .

dialogue type : s^aa^m
B :  So , this week , yeah .

dialogue type : s^na.%-
B :  And , Ami might .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Because , th you know ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  We will .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  OK . Because then , once we have it sort of up and running , then we can start you know , defining the interfaces

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and then feed stuff into it

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and get stuff out of it ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and then hook it up to some fake construction parser

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  Yeah , I can worry about the ontology interface

dialogue type : s^co
B :  and you can Keith can worry about the discourse .

dialogue type : s
