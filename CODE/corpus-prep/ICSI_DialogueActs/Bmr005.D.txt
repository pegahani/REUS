D :  Well - OK .

dialogue type : s^tc
D :  I I remind that me my first objective eh , in the project is to to study difference parameters

dialogue type : s^df
D :  to to find a a good solution to detect eh , the overlapping zone in eh speech recorded .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  But eh , tsk , ehhh In that way I I I begin to to study and to analyze the ehn the recorded speech eh the different session

dialogue type : s^df
D :  to to find and to locate and to mark eh the the different overlapping zone .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And eh so eh I was eh I am transcribing the the first session

dialogue type : s
D :  and I I have found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  eh besides the overlapping zones , eh I I I mean the eh breaths eh aspiration eh , eh , talk eh , eh , clap ,

dialogue type : s^no
D :  eh I don't know what is the different names eh you use to to name the the n speech

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s
D :  Eh , I I I do I don't need to to to mmm to m to label the the different acoustic ,

dialogue type : s^df^rt
D :  but I prefer because eh I would like to to study if eh , I I will find eh , eh , a good eh parameters eh to detect overlapping

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  I would like to to to test these parameters eh with the another eh , eh acoustic events ,

dialogue type : s^df.x
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D :  Ye

dialogue type : s
D :  I I I I t I t I talk eh about eh acoustic events in general ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  but eh my my objective eh will be eh to study eh overlapping zone .

dialogue type : h|s
D :  Eh ? n Eh in twelve minutes I found eh , eh one thousand acoustic events .

dialogue type : qw^m
D :  How many ?

dialogue type : h|s
D :  Eh almost eh three hundred eh in one session

dialogue type : s^e
D :  in five eh in forty - five minutes .

dialogue type : s^aa^m
D :  Alm - Three hundred overlapping zone .

dialogue type : s^bsc
D :  With the overlapping zone , overlapping speech speech what eh different duration .

dialogue type : h|s^rt
D :  Yeah , three people , two people .

dialogue type : h|s^cc
D :  Eh , um I would like to consider eh one people with difference noise eh in the background ,

dialogue type : %-
D :  be

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I consider one event eh for th for that eh for all the zone .

dialogue type : s
D :  This th I I I con I consider I consider eh an acoustic event , the overlapping zone , the period where three speaker or eh are talking together .

dialogue type : s^bu^no
D :  So - I don't understand .

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
D :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : h|s^ar
D :  Eh no . No no .

dialogue type : sj
D :  For me is the overlapping zone ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because because you you have s you have more one eh , more one voice eh , eh produced in a in in a moment .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D :  If

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
D :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I consider the the , nnn the nnn , nnn eh , the entirety

dialogue type : s^df
D :  eh , eh , all all the time there were the voice has overlapped .

dialogue type : s
D :  This is the idea .

dialogue type : s
D :  But eh I I don't distinguish between the the numbers of eh speaker .

dialogue type : s
D :  Uh , I 'm not considering eh the the ehm eh , the fact of eh , eh , for example , what did you say ?

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  Eh at first eh , eh two talkers are uh , eh speaking ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and eh , eh a third person eh join to to that .

dialogue type : s
D :  For me , it 's eh it 's eh , all overlap zone , with eh several numbers of speakers is eh , eh the same acoustic event .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  Wi - but uh , without any mark between the zone of the overlapping zone with two speakers eh speaking together ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and the zone with the three speakers .

dialogue type : s^aa^bk
D :  It One . One .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Eh , with eh , a beginning mark and the ending mark .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because eh for me , is the is the zone with eh some kind of eh distortion the spectral .

dialogue type : s
D :  I don't mind By the moment , by the moment .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  Yeah , but eh but eh I have to study . What will happen in a general way ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^aa^r
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
D : 

dialogue type : %-
D :  General .

dialogue type : s
D :  I I con I consider I consider acoustic events eh , the silent too .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah , silent , ground

dialogue type : s
D :  to bec to detect eh because I consider acoustic event all the things are not eh speech .

dialogue type : s
D :  In ge in in in a general point of view .

dialogue type : %-
D :  in the per

dialogue type : s.x
D :  Too much speech .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^m
D :  Uh silent ,

dialogue type : s^no.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
D :  eh I I would like to to do a stylistic study

dialogue type : s
D :  and give you eh with the report eh from eh the the study from the the the session one session .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I I found that eh another thing .

dialogue type : s
D :  When eh eh I w I I was eh look at eh nnn , the difference speech file ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  um , for example , eh if eh we use the ehm the mixed file , to to transcribe , the the events and the words , I I saw that eh the eh speech signal , collected by the eh this kind of mike eh of this kind of mike , eh are different from the eh mixed signal eh , we eh collected by headphone .

dialogue type : s^m
D :  And It 's right .

dialogue type : s
D :  But the problem is the following .

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I I I knew that eh the signal eh , eh would be different ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but eh the the problem is eh , eh we eh detected eh difference events in the speech file eh collected by by that mike uh qui compared with the mixed file .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so if when you transcribe eh only eh using the nnn the mixed file , it 's possible eh if you use the transcription to evaluate a different system ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  it 's possible you eh in the eh

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  i and you use the eh speech file collected by the eh fet mike , to eh to nnn to do the experiments with the the system ,

dialogue type : s
D :  its possible to evaluate eh , eh or to consider eh acoustic events that which you marked eh in the mixed file , but eh they don't appear in the eh speech signal eh collected by the by the mike .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  Yeah . Oh , it 's a good idea .

dialogue type : sj^ba^r
D :  It 's a good idea I think .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^cs
D :  So and I I I say eh that eh , eh , or this eh only because eh I c I I in my opinion , it 's necessary to eh to eh to put the transcription on the speech file , collected by the objective signal .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean the the the signal collected by the eh , the real mike in the future , in the prototype to to eh correct the initial eh segmentation eh with the eh real speech

dialogue type : s^co
D : 

dialogue type : s^co
D :  you have to to process .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because I I found a difference .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  I I I think eh

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  I saw the nnn the eh

dialogue type : s
D :  but eh I eh I have eh any results .

dialogue type : s
D :  I I I saw the the speech file collected by eh the fet mike ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  and eh eh signal eh to eh to noise eh relation is eh low .

dialogue type : s^r
D :  It 's low .

dialogue type : s^r
D :  It 's very low . You would comp if we compare it with eh the headphone .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  I I found that nnn that eh , ehm , pr probably ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'm not sure eh by the moment ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  but it 's it 's probably that eh a lot of eh , eh

dialogue type : s
D :  for example , in the overlapping zone , on eh in in several eh parts of the files where you you can find eh , eh eh , smooth eh eh speech eh from eh one eh eh talker in the in the meeting ,

dialogue type : s
D :  it 's probably in in that eh in in those files you you can not find you can not process

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because eh it 's confused with with noise .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  And there are a lot of

dialogue type : sj
D :  I think .

dialogue type : s^bd^cc
D :  But I have to study with more detail .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  But eh my idea is to to process only nnn , this eh nnn , this kind of s of eh speech .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because I think it 's more realistic .

dialogue type : sj^ba.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Mm - hmm . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  With By Jane .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  i i it 's a reference for me .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  But eh the transcription eh for example , I I don't I I 'm not interested in the in the in the words , transcription words , eh transcribed eh eh in eh follow in the in the in the speech file , but eh eh Jane eh for example eh put a mark eh at the beginning eh of each eh talker ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  in the in the meeting ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  um eh she she nnn includes information about the zone where eh there are eh there is an overlapping zone .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  But eh there isn't any any mark , time temporal mark , to to c eh to mmm e - heh , to label the beginning and the end of the of the

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  ta I 'm I I I think eh we need this information to

dialogue type : s^bc^m
D :  Twelve minutes .

dialogue type : s^aa^r^rt
D :  Twelve minutes .

dialogue type : s^aa^t
D :  Twelve .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^bc
D :  No , forty - five minutes is the is the session ,

dialogue type : s^r
D :  all the session .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^r
D :  all is the the session .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Tw - twelve hours of work to to segment eh and label eh twelve minutes from a session of part of f

dialogue type : b.%
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  No no no .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  I I consider all the all the session because eh I I count the nnn the nnn the overlappings marked by by Jane ,

dialogue type : s
D :  in in in in the fin in in the forty - five minutes .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  But , by by the moment , I I don't compare , my my temporal mark with eh Jane , but eh I I want to do it .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because eh eh i per perhaps I have eh errors in the in the marks ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I and if I I compare with eh Jane , it 's probably I I I can correct and and and to get eh eh a more accurately eh eh transcription in the file .
