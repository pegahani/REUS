dialogue type : h|s^nd

dialogue type : s
C :  but what our discussion yesterday , I really I I wanna submit one .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , of course , no , it doesn't necessarily go against what he said ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  cuz he said " generally speaking " . In order to to go against that kind of a claim you 'd have to big canvassing .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  It 's i it 's not against his conclusion ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  it just says that it 's a bi bell curve , and that , you have something that has a nice range , in your sampling .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s.%-

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^bd

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : qy^d
C :  Comma also or not ?

dialogue type : s
C :  I have a reference for that though .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : h|s^no
C :  Well , I didn't know about Liz 's finding on that ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but I know of another paper that talks about something

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  He still has his Unix account here , you know .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  That 's good .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : h|qy^d^rt
C :  So , um you know that Adam created um , a b a script to generate the beep file ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  To then create something to send to IBM .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  you you should probably talk about that .

dialogue type : s
C :  But but you were gonna to use the originally transcribed file

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because I tightened the time bins

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and that 's also the one that they had already in trying to debug the first stage of this .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And uh ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  my understanding was that ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I haven't I haven't listened to it yet ,

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  but it sounded very good

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  and and I understand that you guys were going to have a meeting today , before this meeting .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Excellent .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh !

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Ah , interesting .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Oh , sure .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah , sure .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Makes sense .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Ah !

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Clever .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Clever .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Excellent .

dialogue type : s
C :  And that 's the purpose .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Great idea !

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s^m^na
C : 

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So that is the training meeting .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Oh , interesting .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Ah !

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Interesting idea .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Great .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  I went back and hand - marked the ba the bins ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I ment I mentioned that last week .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Sure .

dialogue type : b
C :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  They were , um , reasonably tight , but not excruciatingly tight .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  That would 've taken more time .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I can't answer that ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but but my main goal was um , in these areas where you have a three - way overlap and one of the overlaps involves " yeah " , and it 's swimming in this huge bin , I wanted to get it so that it was clo more closely localized .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I wanted it to be able to l he be heard normally ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  so that if you if you play back that bin and have it in the mode where it stops at the boundary , it sounds like a normal word .

dialogue type : s^e
C : 

dialogue type : s^e
C :  i it sounds normal .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  It 's as if the person could 've stopped there .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And it wouldn't have been an awkward place to stop .

dialogue type : s
C :  Now sometimes you know , it 's these are involved in places where there was no time .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean some cases , there 're some people um , who who have very long segments of discourse where , you know , they 'll they 'll breath and then I put a break .

dialogue type : s
C :  But other than that , it 's really pretty continuous

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and this includes things like going from one sentence into the u one utterance into the next , one sentence into the next ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  um ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  w without really stopping .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  I mean i they , i

dialogue type : s
C :  you know in writing you have this two spaces and a big gap

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  you know .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  But but uh i some people are planning

dialogue type : s
C :  and , you know , I mean , a lot we always are planning what we 're going to say next .

dialogue type : s
C :  But uh , in which case , the gap between these two complete syntactic units , um , which of course n spoken things are not always complete syntactically ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but but it would be a shorter p shorter break than maybe you might like .

dialogue type : s
C :  But the goal there was to not have the text be so so crudely parsed in a time bin .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  and also you know , from a speech recognition purpose my impression is that if you have too long a unit , it 's it doesn't help you very much either ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  cuz of the memory .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , that means that the amount of time after something is variable depending partly on context ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but my general goal when there was sufficient space , room , pause after it to have it be kind of a natural feeling gap .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  Which I c I don't know what it would be quantified as .

dialogue type : s
C :  You know , Wally Chafe says that um , in producing narratives , the spurts that people use tend to be , uh , that the the what would be a pause might be something like two two seconds .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And um , that would be , you know one speaker .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I was interested that you chose uh , you know um , the you know that you use

dialogue type : s^df
C :  cuz I think that 's a unit that would be more consistent with sociolinguistics .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I I hand - adjusted two of them

dialogue type : s
C :  I mentioned before ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and I sent I sent email ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  And I sent the path .

dialogue type : s
C :  But I like this idea of uh , for our purposes for the for the IBM preparation , uh , n having these joined together ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  It makes a lot of sense .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  And in terms of transcription , it would be easy to do it that way .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  The way that they have with the longer units ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  not having to fuss with adding these units at this time .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Well ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  that 's that 's right ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but you know , thi this brings me to the other f stage of this which I discussed with you earlier today ,

dialogue type : s
C :  which is the second stage is um , w what to do in terms of the transcribers adjustment of these data .

dialogue type : s
C :  I discussed this with you too .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C :  Um , the tr

dialogue type : s
C :  so the idea initially was , we would get uh , for the new meetings ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  so the e EDU meetings , that Thilo ha has now presegmented all of them for us , on a channel by channel basis .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so , I 've assigned I 've I 've assigned them to our transcribers

dialogue type : fh
C :  and um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so far I 've discussed it with one ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  And I had a about an hour discussion with her about this yesterday ,

dialogue type : s
C :  we went through uh EDU - one , at some extent .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it occurred to me that um that basically what we have in this kind of a format is you could consider it as a staggered mixed file ,

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : fh|s^e
C :  um , about whether the tran the IBM transcribers should hear a single channel audio , or a mixed channel audio .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And um , in in a way , by by having this this chunk and then the backchannel after it , it 's like a stagal staggered mixed channel .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
C :  And um , it occurred to me in my discussion with her yesterday that um ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  the the the maximal gain , it 's from the IBM people , may be in long stretches of connected speech .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  So it 's basically a whole bunch of words which they can really do , because of the continuity within that person 's turn .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
C :  So , what I 'm thinking , and it may be that not all meetings will be good for this , but but what I 'm thinking is that in the EDU meetings , they tend to be driven by a couple of dominant speakers .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  And , if the chunked files focused on the dominant speakers , then , when when it got s patched together when it comes back from IBM , we can add the backchannels .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  It seems to me that um , you know , the backchannels per - se wouldn't be so hard ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  but then there 's this question of the time @ @ uh , marking , and whether the beeps would be uh y y y

dialogue type : s^no
C :  And I 'm not exactly sure how that how that would work with the with the backchannels .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  And certainly things that are intrusions of multiple words , taken out of context and displaced in time from where they occurred , that would be hard .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , m my thought is i I 'm having this transcriber go through the EDU - one meeting , and indicate a start time f for each dominant speaker , endpoi end time for each dominant speaker ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and the idea that these units would be generated for the dominant speakers , and maybe not for the other channels .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  I think I I think um , you know , the original plan was that the transcriber would adjust the t the boundaries , and all that for all the channels

dialogue type : s
C :  but , you know , that is so time - consuming ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  and since we have a bottleneck here , we want to get IBM things that are usable s as soon as possible ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  then this seemed to me it 'd be a way of gett to get them a flood of data ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  which would be useful when it comes back to us .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s^e
C :  w uh , so you know , so that that bin would be marked as it as double dots

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and she 'll just add an S .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And in the other in the other case , if it 's marked as speech , and really there 's nothing transcribable in it , then she 's going to put a s dash ,

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  and I 'll go through and it and um , you know , with a with a substitution command , get it so that it 's clear that those are the other category .

dialogue type : s^cc
C :  I 'll just , you know , recode them .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  But um , um , the transcribable events that um , I 'm considering in this , uh , continue to be laugh , as well as speech , and cough and things like that ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so I 'm not stripping out anything ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  just just you know , being very lenient in what 's considered speech .

dialogue type : qw^d
C :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  So what it what it what it involves is is really a s uh , uh , the original pr procedure ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  but only applied to uh , a certain strategically chosen s aspect of the data .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^na
C :  You got it .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  Yes !

dialogue type : s^ar^r
C :  Yes !

dialogue type : s^aa^fe
C :  Oh yeah !

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then um , the transcriber , instead of going painstakingly through all the channels and moving the boundaries around , and deciding if it 's speech or not , but not transcribing anything .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  So what they do is they identify who 's the di dominant speaker , and when the speaker starts .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's based on your se presegmentation ,

dialogue type : s
C :  that 's the basic thing .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Exactly .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  Uh No . No , no .

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  Huh - uh .

dialogue type : %-
C :  S

dialogue type : s^df
C :  That 's that 's why she 's notating the start and end points of the dominant speakers .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  So , on a you know , so i in EDU - one , i as far as I listened to it , you start off with a a s section by Jerry .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  So Jerry starts at minute so - and - so ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and goes until minute so - and - so .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And then Mark Paskin comes in .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And he starts at minute such - and - such ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  and goes on till minute so - and - so .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then meanwhile , she 's listening to both of these guys ' channels ,

dialogue type : s
C :  determining if there 're any cases of misclassification of speech as nothing , and nothing as speech ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and a and adding a tag if that happens .

dialogue type : s
C :  But you know , I wanted to say , his segmentation is so good , that um , the part that I listened to with her yesterday didn't need any adjustments of the bins .

dialogue type : s
C :  So far we haven't .

dialogue type : s
C :  So this is not gonna be a major part of the process ,

dialogue type : s^e.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm ?

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : h
C :  Well , OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  She i It 's a question of how much time we want our transcriber to invest here when she 's gonna have to invest that when it comes back from IBM anyway .

dialogue type : qy
C :  So if it 's only inserting " mm - hmm "s here and there , then , wouldn't that be something that would be just as efficient to do at this end , instead of having it go through I B M , then be patched together , then be double checked here .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^na
C :  I 'm I 'm open to that ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : fg
C :  Well yea

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
C :  OK , good .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  Now , you were saying that they they differ in how well they work depending on channel s sys systems and stuff .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  But EDU is great .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  How interesting .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bh
C :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : qy^bh
C :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^2
C :  Is intelligible .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  That 's interesting !

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Cuz that 's that 's directly related to the e end task .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
C :  How interesting !

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  Well , eh , listening does take time too .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  How interesting !

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  So I was gonna say , EDU - one is good enough ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  maybe we could include it in this in this set of uh , this stuff we send .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s
C :  Know what numbers .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Oh , that 'd be great .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  They do already .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , we have the unintelligibility convention .

dialogue type : s
C :  And actually they have one also ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^t3
C :  Certainty .

dialogue type : qw.%-
C :  Was is it in a in a what what is the t

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  In a good meeting ,

dialogue type : qw.%-
C :  what ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh I see ,

dialogue type : s
C :  the characteristics .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : %
C :  Just

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm !

dialogue type : s
C :  The other problem is , that when it when it uh d i on the breathy ones , where you get breathing , uh , inti indicated as speech .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  We could still do the beep file .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  That would be great .

dialogue type : s^ba^na
C :  Wow , that 's a great idea .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  Excellent .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Oh , I 'd be delighted with that ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I I was very impressed with the with the result .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh yeah ,

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  interesting .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
C :  I pr I much prefer this ,

dialogue type : s^na.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Cuz I I don't think the staggered mixed channel is awfully good as a way of handling overlaps .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Oh , I 'd be delighted .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well you were suggesting You suggested maybe just not sending that part of the meeting .

dialogue type : s^co
C :  Yeah , go ahead .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Well ,

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  So my standard approach has been if it 's not someone close - miked , then , they don't end up on one of the close - miked channels .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  They end up on a different channel .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And we have any number of channels available ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  I mean it 's an infinite number of channels .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  So just put them on some other channel .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  that 's right .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , they have a convention , in their own procedures , which is for a background sound .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^nd
C :  Oh , I think I think it 'd be easy to to say " background laptop " .

dialogue type : s.%-

dialogue type : s^bk.%--
C :  Oh , I s

dialogue type : s
C :  background laptop or , background LT wouldn't take any time .

dialogue type : %-
