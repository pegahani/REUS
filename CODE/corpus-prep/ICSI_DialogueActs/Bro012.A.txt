dialogue type : fg|s^t^tc
A :  OK , so uh had some interesting mail from uh Dan Ellis .

dialogue type : s
A :  Actually , I think he he redirected it to everybody also

dialogue type : s
A :  so uh the PDA mikes uh have a big bunch of energy at at uh five hertz

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh

dialogue type : s
A :  where this came up was that uh I was showing off these wave forms that we have on the web

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  and and uh I just sort of hadn't noticed this , but that the major , major component in the wave in the second wave form in that pair of wave forms is actually the air conditioner .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  I I have to be more careful about using that as a as a as a good illustration ,

dialogue type : s
A :  uh , in fact it 's not , of uh of the effects of room reverberation .

dialogue type : s
A :  It is isn't a bad illustration of the effects of uh room noise . on on uh some mikes

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh but

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then we had this other discussion about um whether this affects the dynamic range ,

dialogue type : s
A :  cuz I know , although we start off with thirty two bits , you end up with uh sixteen bits

dialogue type : qo
A :  and you know , are we getting hurt there ?

dialogue type : s.x
A :  But uh Dan is pretty confident that we 're not , that that quantization error is not is still not a significant factor there .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  So there was a question of whether we should change things here ,

dialogue type : s
A :  whether we should change a capacitor on the input box for that

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  or whether we should

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  But then I had some other uh thing discussions with him

dialogue type : s
A :  and the feeling was once we start monk monkeying with that , uh , many other problems could ha happen .

dialogue type : s
A :  And additionally we we already have a lot of data that 's been collected with that ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  A simple thing to do is

dialogue type : s
A :  he he he has a I forget if it this was in that mail or in the following mail ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but he has a a simple filter , a digital filter that he suggested .

dialogue type : s
A :  We just run over the data before we deal with it .

dialogue type : fg|s^tc
A :  um The other thing that I don't know the answer to , but when people are using Feacalc here , uh whether they 're using it with the high - pass filter option or not .

dialogue type : s
A :  And I don't know if anybody knows .

dialogue type : fh
A :  But .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  um if it 's if it 's based on the RASTA - PLP program , which does both PLP and RASTA - PLP um then uh there is an option there which then comes up through to Feacalc which um allows you to do high - pass filtering

dialogue type : s
A :  and in general we like to do that , because of things like this

dialogue type : s
A :  and it 's it 's pretty it 's not a very severe

dialogue type : s
A :  filter . Doesn't affect speech frequencies ,

dialogue type : s
A :  even pretty low speech frequencies , at all ,

dialogue type : %--
A :  but it 's

dialogue type : h
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I don't know

dialogue type : s^df
A :  I wrote this a while ago

dialogue type : s^am
A :  Something like that .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean I think there 's some effect above twenty

dialogue type : s
A :  but it 's it 's it 's it 's mild .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , I mean it probably there 's probably some effect up to a hundred hertz or something but it 's it 's pretty mild .

dialogue type : qr.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  So . We we we want to go and check that in i for anything that we 're going to use the P D

dialogue type : s
A :  A mike for . uh He says that there 's a pretty good roll off in the PZM mikes

dialogue type : s
A :  so we don't need need to worry about them one way or the other

dialogue type : s
A :  but if we do make use of the cheap mikes , uh we want to be sure to do that that filtering before we process it .

dialogue type : %--
A :  And then again if it 's

dialogue type : s
A :  uh depending on the option that the our our software is being run with , it 's it 's quite possible that 's already being taken care of .

dialogue type : s
A :  uh But I also have to pick a different picture to show the effects of reverberation .

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh

dialogue type : h|s^ar
A :  uh No .

dialogue type : %--
A :  Well .

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Well . If they made output

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  they were they were , you know they were nice .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  But . I mean the thing is it was

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  since I was talking about reverberation and showing this thing that was noise , it wasn't a good match ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but it certainly was still uh an indication of the fact that you get noise with distant mikes .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  uh It 's just not a great example because not only isn't it reverberation but it 's a noise that we definitely know what to do .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , I mean , it doesn't take deep a new bold new methods to get rid of uh five hertz noise ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : fh
A :  um uh But .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  So it was it was a bad example in that way ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but it 's it still is it 's the real thing that we did

dialogue type : s
A :  so it wasn't it w it w wasn't wrong it was inappropriate .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So . So uh , but uh ,

dialogue type : fg|s:s
A :  Yeah , someone noticed it later pointed it out to me , and I went " oh , man .

dialogue type : s:qw
A :  Why didn't I notice that ? "

dialogue type : fh
A :  um . So . um

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So I think we 'll change our our picture on the web , when we 're @ @ .

dialogue type : s
A :  One of the things I was I mean , I was trying to think about what what 's the best way to show the difference an and I had a couple of thoughts

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  one was , that spectrogram that we show is O K ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  but the thing is the eyes uh and the the brain behind them are so good at picking out patterns from from noise that in first glance

dialogue type : s^e
A :  you look at them it doesn't seem like it 's that bad

dialogue type : s^df
A :  uh because there 's many features that are still preserved .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  So one thing to do might be to just take a piece of the spec uh of the spectrogram where you can see that something looks different ,

dialogue type : s
A :  an and blow it up , and have that be the part that 's just to show as well .

dialogue type : s^f
A :  You know .

dialogue type : s
A :  i i Some things are going to be hurt .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  um Another , I was thinking of was um taking some spectral slices ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
A :  like uh like we look at with the recognizer ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e
A :  and look at the spectrum or cepstrum that you get out of there ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and the the uh , um , the reverberation uh does make it does change that .

dialogue type : s
A :  And so maybe maybe that would be more obvious .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , I mean um all the recognizers look at frames .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So it 's ,

dialogue type : b
A :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s
A :  at one point in time or uh twenty over twenty milliseconds or something , you have a spectrum or a cepstrum .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's what I meant by a slice .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Right . Well , that 's why I saying

dialogue type : s
A :  either Well , either spectrum or cepstrum

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh . I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  That would be lovely ,

dialogue type : b
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  Or I could just add them up and get a different total .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qw
A :  Uh . What else wh what 's what else is going on ?

dialogue type : h|s
A :  Uh . I guess cuz we haven't wanted to move it .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
A :  We we could we could move us ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  and .

dialogue type : s^bu^df
A :  But it 's not wer worse

dialogue type : s^bu^df
A :  and it 's better better latency ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : fg|s^bu
A :  Right . So this was Italian ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s
A :  So then if you take your changes

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b^rt
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  A tenth of a per cent .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh !

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw
A :  Well , what 's what are according to the rules what what are we supposed to do about the transition probabilities ?

dialogue type : qr
A :  Are they supposed to be point five or point six ?

dialogue type : s^bu^m
A :  Point It 's supposed to be point six .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
A :  But not allowed ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah . OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Well . Yes .

dialogue type : %--
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  And that that says that we could have lots more parameters actually .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
A :  Yeah . Cuz at forty thou I mean you could you could have

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Yeah , easily four times as many parameters .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^fa
A :  Sorry .

dialogue type : qw.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  So . You you did some things .

dialogue type : s
A :  They didn't improve things in a way that convinced you you 'd substantially improved anything .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  But they 're not making things worse and we have reduced latency ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
A :  So they do improvement in terms of uh accuracy ? rather than word error rate ?

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  So if you have uh ten percent error and you get five percent absolute uh improvement then that 's fifty percent .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bs
A :  OK . So what you 're saying then is that if it 's something that has a small word error rate , then uh a even a relatively small improvement on it , in absolute terms , will show up as quite quite large in this .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  Is that what you 're saying ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  But yeah that 's that 's it 's the notion of relative improvement .

dialogue type : s
A :  Word error rate .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b^rt
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
A :  No .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  That 's why I 've been saying we should be looking at word error rate uh and and not not at at accuracies .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean uh we probably should have standardized on that all the way through .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah

dialogue type : s^arp^df
A :  but you 're but when you look at the numbers , your sense of the relative size of things is quite different .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  If you had ninety percent uh correct and five percent ,

dialogue type : s
A :  five over ninety doesn't look like it 's a big difference ,

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  but five over ten is is big .

dialogue type : s
A :  So just when we were looking at a lot of numbers and getting sense of what was important .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : qw
A :  What 's a little bit ?

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
A :  Yeah , it was actually updated .

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh . Jeff updated it some years ago

dialogue type : s
A :  and and uh cleaned it up made some things better in it .

dialogue type : %-
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , I 'm sure it 's not that different

dialogue type : s
A :  but but he he uh he was a little more rigorous , as I recall .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Worse .

dialogue type : qw
A :  Out of what ?

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I mean . s

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So that 's six six point th

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|sj^ba
A :  OK , so we are getting hurt somewhat .

dialogue type : qy.%--
A :  And is that

dialogue type : qw.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qy.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A :  you 've done several changes here .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh ,

dialogue type : qy.%-
A :  do you know what pie

dialogue type : fg|s^am
A :  Well , yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  But OK , so you these these degradations you were talking about were on the well - matched case

dialogue type : qy
A :  Uh . Do the does the new filter make things uh better or worse for the other cases ?

dialogue type : s^bu^m
A :  Doesn't hurt , but doesn't get a little better , or something .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
A :  No .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  OK , so um I guess the argument one might make is that , " Yeah , if you looked at one of these cases and you jiggle something and it changes then uh you 're not quite sure what to make of it .

dialogue type : %--
A :  But when you look across a bunch of these and there 's some some pattern ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean , so eh h here 's all the if if in all these different cases it never gets better , and there 's significant number of cases where it gets worse , then you 're probably hurting things , I would say .

dialogue type : s
A :  So um I mean at the very least that would be a reasonably prediction of what would happen with with a different test set , that you 're not jiggling things with .

dialogue type : qo^d
A :  So I guess the question is if you can do better than this .

dialogue type : s
A :  If you can if we can approximate the old numbers while still keeping the latency down .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Uh , so .

dialogue type : fh|qw
A :  Um . What I was asking , though , is uh are what 's what 's the level of communication with uh the O G I gang now , about this

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is there any further discussion about this this idea of of having some sort of source code control ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Sounds like a great idea

dialogue type : s
A :  but but I think that that um he 's saying people are sort of scrambling for a Eurospeech deadline .

dialogue type : s
A :  But that 'll be uh , uh done in a week .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , maybe after this next one .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qo^rt
A :  Anybo - anybody in the in this group do doing anything for Eurospeech ?

dialogue type : qy.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  For uh Oh , for Eurospeech ?

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
A :  Oh !

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Oh , a special dispensation .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  That 's great .

dialogue type : s^rt
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  Aalborg

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qw
A :  When 's the deadline ?

dialogue type : qw^r^rt
A :  When 's the deadline ?

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  That 's great !

dialogue type : s^r
A :  It 's great .

dialogue type : s
A :  So we should definitely get something in for that .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^am
A :  Maybe .

dialogue type : s^am
A :  Maybe .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah . So , I mean , I I think that you could certainly start looking at at the issue

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Good .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Dave , the other thing , actually , is is this business about this wave form .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Maybe you and I can talk a little bit at some point about coming up with a better uh demonstration of the effects of reverberation for our web page ,

dialogue type : %--
A :  cuz

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh the uh um

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I mean , actually the the

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar^bd|sj^ba
A :  No , I mean , it sound it sounds pretty reverberant ,

dialogue type : s
A :  but I mean you can't when you play it back in a room with a you know a big room , nobody can hear that difference really .

dialogue type : s
A :  They hear that it 's lower amplitude and they hear there 's a second voice ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  um but uh

dialogue type : s
A :  that actually that makes for a perfectly good demo

dialogue type : s^df
A :  because that 's a real obvious thing , that you hear two voices .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bd
A :  Well that that that 's OK .

dialogue type : s^co
A :  But for the the visual , just , you know , I 'd like to have uh uh , you know , the spectrogram again ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^df
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s:s
A : 

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
A :  uh uh formant maj major formants here are are moving quite a bit . "

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  And then you look in the other one and they look practically flat .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  So I mean you could that 's why I was thinking , in a section like that , you could take a look look at just that part of the spectrogram and you could say " Oh yeah .

dialogue type : s:s
A :  This this really distorted it quite a bit . "

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : %--
A :  But it 's it 's

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So there are clearly are spectral effects .

dialogue type : s
A :  Since you 're getting all this indirect energy , then a lot of it does have have uh reduced high frequencies .

dialogue type : s
A :  But um the other thing is the temporal courses of things really are changed , and and uh we want to show that , in some obvious way .

dialogue type : s
A :  The reason I put the wave forms in there was because uh they they do look quite different .

dialogue type : s:sj^ba
A :  Uh . And so I thought " Oh , this is good . "

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  but I I just

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  After after uh they were put in there I didn't really look at them anymore ,

dialogue type : s
A :  cuz I just they were different .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I want something that has a is a more interesting explanation for why they 're different .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s^am
A :  Something like that .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  The other thing that we had in there that I didn't like was that um the most obvious characteristic of the difference uh when you listen to it is that there 's a second voice ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and the the the the the uh cuts that we have there actually don't correspond to the full wave form .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  I think there was something where he was having some trouble getting so much in ,

dialogue type : %--
A :  or .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I I forget the reason behind it .

dialogue type : s
A :  But it it 's um it 's the first six seconds or something of it

dialogue type : s
A :  and it 's in the seventh or eighth second or something where @ @ the second voice comes in .

dialogue type : s
A :  So we we would like to actually see the voice coming in , too , I think ,

dialogue type : s^df
A :  since that 's the most obvious thing when you listen to it .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b^rt
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^j
A :  Normalizes the variance .

dialogue type : qw^2^bu^rt
A :  What 's the rationale ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , I mean , because everything uh If you have a system based on Gaussians , everything is based on means and variances .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  You know , it 's like uh if you were doing uh image processing

dialogue type : s
A :  and in some of the pictures you were looking at , uh there was a lot of light

dialogue type : s
A :  uh and and in some , there was low light ,

dialogue type : s
A :  you know , you would want to adjust for that in order to compare things .

dialogue type : s
A :  And the variance is just sort of like the next moment ,

dialogue type : s^f
A :  you know ?

dialogue type : qo
A :  So uh what if um one set of pictures was taken uh so that throughout the course it was went through daylight and night uh um um ten times ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  another time it went thr

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I mean i is , you know , how how much how much vari

dialogue type : s^bsc
A :  Or no .

dialogue type : qo
A :  I guess a better example would be how much of the light was coming in from outside

dialogue type : s
A :  rather than artificial light .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  So every mean every all all of the the parameters that you have , especially the variances , are going to be affected by the overall variance .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  That 's the first order but thing ,

dialogue type : s^bk^m
A :  but then the second order is is the variances

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  because , again , if you if you 're trying to distinguish between E and B

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  if it just so happens that the E 's were a more you know , were recorded when when the energy was was was larger or something ,

dialogue type : s
A :  or the variation in it was larger , uh than with the B 's , then this will be give you some some bias .

dialogue type : s
A :  So the it 's removing these sources of variability in the data that have nothing to do with the linguistic component .

dialogue type : s
A :  But the the uh but let me as ask ask you something .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  i is if If you have a good voice activity detector , isn't isn't it gonna pull that out ?

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s^bs
A :  Yeah . So basically you want to reduce this effect .

dialogue type : s
A :  So you can do that by doing the voi voice activity detection .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  You also could do it by spect uh spectral subtraction before the variance normalization ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So it does get better even though it looks ugly .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  but does this have the voice activity detection in it ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^am
A :  Spectral subtraction , I guess .

dialogue type : qy.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Can I ask a , I mean a sort of top - level question ,

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  which is um " if if most of what the OGI folk are working with is trying to integrate this other other uh spectral subtraction , why are we worrying about it ? "

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Right .

dialogue type : %--
A :  I mean , i the

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Intellectually it 's interesting to work on things th uh one way or the other

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  but I 'm I 'm just wondering if um on the list of things that there are to do ,

dialogue type : s
A :  if there are things that we won't do because we 've got two groups doing the same thing .

dialogue type : %--
A :  Um .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
A :  Just just asking .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^am
A :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
A :  I don't know . I mean , we still evidently have a latency reduction plan which which isn't quite what you 'd like it to be .

dialogue type : s
A :  That that seems like one prominent thing .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  And then uh weren't issues of of having a a second stream or something ?

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
A :  There was this business that , you know , we we could use up the full forty - eight hundred bits ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Do you remember when the next meeting is supposed to be ?

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk^m
A :  In June .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
A :  Um . Yeah , the other thing is that you saw that that mail about uh the VAD V A Ds performing quite differently ?

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  That that

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh

dialogue type : fh
A :  So um .

dialogue type : qo
A :  This there was this experiment of uh " what if we just take the baseline ? "

dialogue type : s
A :  set uh of features ,

dialogue type : s
A :  just mel cepstra ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and you inc incorporate the different V A

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  And it looks like the the French VAD is actually uh better significantly better .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
A :  And on that one , uh the French one is was better .

dialogue type : s^r
A :  It was just better .

dialogue type : s
A :  I mean it was enough better that that it would uh account for a fair amount of the difference between our performance , actually .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So . Uh .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  So if they have a better one , we should use it .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I mean .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  You know ?

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  you can't work on everything .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh . Uh . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  H Hynek will be back in town uh the week after next ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  back back in the country .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s
A :  And start start organizing uh more visits and connections and so forth ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh

dialogue type : s
A :  working towards June .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bs
A :  No use of pitch uh basically .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah , you can make these mistakes ,

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  Well , I think he was talking about the voiced - unvoiced , though ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s^e
A :  So , not the speech - nonspeech .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Well .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^co
A :  Uh yeah . B We should let him finish what he w he was gonna say ,

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : %-
A :  U

dialogue type : %-
A :  So u s u

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  So So many tell you something about that .

dialogue type : s
A :  Uh we had a guy here some years ago who did some work on um making use of voicing information uh to help in reducing the noise .

dialogue type : s
A :  So what he was doing is basically y you you do estimate the pitch .

dialogue type : %--
A :  And

dialogue type : fh
A :  um

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  or you estimate fine harmonic structure ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  whichev

dialogue type : s
A :  ei either way ,

dialogue type : s
A :  it 's more or less the same .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  i if there is strong harmonic structure , you can throw away stuff that 's that 's non - harmonic .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  And that that is another way of getting rid of part of the noise

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  So um that 's something that is sort of finer ,

dialogue type : s
A :  brings in a little more information than just spectral subtraction .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  And he had some I mean , he did that sort of in combination with RASTA .

dialogue type : s
A :  It was kind of like RASTA was taking care of convolutional stuff

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  and and got some some decent results doing that .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that that 's another another way .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  There 's all these cues .

dialogue type : %--
A :  We 've

dialogue type : s
A :  actually back when Chuck was here we did some voiced - unvoiced uh classification using a bunch of these ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  and and

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  works OK .

dialogue type : sj^bd
A :  Obviously it 's not perfect

dialogue type : %--
A :  but

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  the probabilistic information that you might get about whether it 's voiced or unvoiced ,

dialogue type : s
A :  where w we can't you know affect the the uh distributions or anything .

dialogue type : %--
A :  But we what we

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I guess we could

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %--
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that 's voice activity detector as opposed to voicing detector .

dialogue type : s
A :  So we 're talking about something a little different .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A :  I guess what you could do , maybe

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  this would be w useful , if if you have if you view the second stream ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A :  yeah , before you before you do KLT 's and so forth ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  if you do view it as probabilities ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So , if it 's if it 's uh not so much envelope - based by fine - structure - based ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  uh looking at harmonicity or something like that ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um if you get a probability from that information

dialogue type : s
A :  and then multiply it by you know , multiply by all the voiced outputs and all the unvoiced outputs ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  you know , then use that as the

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  uh take the log of that

dialogue type : fh|s^rt.%--
A :  or uh pre pre uh pre - nonlinearity ,

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  uh and do the KLT on the on on that ,

dialogue type : s
A :  then that would that would I guess be uh a reasonable use of independent information .

dialogue type : s
A :  So maybe that 's what you meant .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
A :  R Right . So you have a second neural net .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  It could be pretty small .

dialogue type : fg|s^rt
A :  Yeah . If you have a tandem system

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  we used we d did some of this stuff .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Uh I I did , some years ago ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and the and and you use the thing is to use information primarily that 's different

dialogue type : s
A :  as you say , it 's more fine - structure - based than than envelope - based

dialogue type : s
A :  uh so then it you you you can pretty much guarantee it 's stuff that you 're not looking at very well with the other one ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and uh then you only use for this one distinction .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  And and so now you 've got a probability of the cases ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and you 've got uh the probability of the finer uh categories on the other side .

dialogue type : s
A :  You multiply them where appropriate

dialogue type : fh
A :  and

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh um

dialogue type : s
A :  if they really are from independent information sources then they should have different kinds of errors

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  and roughly independent errors ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh .

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  Yeah , that 's a good idea .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A :  Or if you do a spectral subtraction do some spectral subtraction first

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  and then do some on - line normalization

dialogue type : s^fe^rt
A : 

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I mean , maybe maybe you can do it layers or something

dialogue type : s
A :  so it doesn't doesn't hurt too much or something .

dialogue type : s^tc
A :  But it but uh , anyway I think I was sort of arguing against myself there by giving that example

dialogue type : fh|s^df^rt
A :  uh I mean cuz I was already sort of suggesting that we should be careful about not spending too much time on exactly what they 're doing

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  In fact if you get if you go into uh a uh harmonics - related thing it 's definitely going to be different than what they 're doing

dialogue type : fh
A :  and uh uh

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  should have some interesting properties in noise .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um . I know that when have people have done um sort of the obvious thing of taking uh your feature vector and adding in some variables which are pitch related

dialogue type : %--
A :  or

dialogue type : sj^ba
A :  uh that it hasn't my impression it hasn't particularly helped .

dialogue type : s^r
A :  Uh . Has not .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  But I think uh that 's that 's a question for this uh you know extending the feature vector versus having different streams .

dialogue type : s^nd
A :  And and it may not have been noisy conditions .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^no
A :  I I don't remember the example

dialogue type : s
A :  but it was it was on some DARPA data and some years ago

dialogue type : s
A :  and so it probably wasn't , actually

dialogue type : b^rt
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  Why don't you why don't you just do it with Aurora ?

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
A :  Just any i in in each in each frame

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  Why not ?

dialogue type : s^bk.%
A :  I see .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  But you could I mean you can you can align so that It 's not perfect ,

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  but if you if you know what was said

dialogue type : fh
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  I see .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I mean in experiments that we did a long time ago

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  and different ta

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  it was probably Resource Management or something ,

dialogue type : s
A :  um , I think you were getting something like still eight or nine percent error on the voicing , as I recall .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And um , so um

dialogue type : s
A :  what that said is that , sort of , left to its own devices , like without the a strong language model and so forth , that you would you would make significant number of errors just with your uh probabilistic machinery in deciding

dialogue type : %--
A :  one oh

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well back twenty years ago when I did this voiced - unvoiced stuff , we were getting more like ninety - seven or ninety - eight percent correct in voicing .

dialogue type : s^bd^df
A :  But that was speaker - dependent actually .

dialogue type : s
A :  We were doing training on a particular announcer

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  and and getting a very good handle on the features .

dialogue type : s
A :  And we did this complex feature selection thing where we looked at all the different possible features one could have for voicing

dialogue type : s
A :  and and and uh and exhaustively searched all size subsets

dialogue type : s
A :  and and uh for for that particular speaker and you 'd find you know the five or six features which really did well on them .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then doing doing all of that we could get down to two or three percent error .

dialogue type : s
A :  But that , again , was speaker - dependent with lots of feature selection

dialogue type : s
A :  and a very complex sort of thing .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  So I would I would believe that uh it was quite likely that

dialogue type : fh
A :  um

dialogue type : s^rt
A :  looking at envelope only , that we 'd be significantly worse than that .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  The modern ones don't do a a simple switch .

dialogue type : s^m^na
A :  They work on the code book excitation .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah they do analysis - by - synthesis .

dialogue type : s
A :  They try they they try every every possible excitation they have in their code book and find the one that matches best .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h
A :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt^t^tc
A :  O K .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : qw
A :  But what about the testing data ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt^t^tc
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  So we 're gonna read some more digit strings I guess ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Sure .
