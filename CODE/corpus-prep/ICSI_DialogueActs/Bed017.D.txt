dialogue type : z
D :  Um .

dialogue type : z
D :  Wow .

dialogue type : z
D :  What is it ?

dialogue type : z
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : z
D :  there .

dialogue type : z
D :  Um , OK .

dialogue type : z
D :  The thing is I don't know how to get to the next page . Here .

dialogue type : z
D :  Actually I thought

dialogue type : z
D :  There .

dialogue type : z
D :  How weird .

dialogue type : z
D :  What ? !

dialogue type : z
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : z
D :  OK . I

dialogue type : z
D :  wasn't even doing anything . OK .

dialogue type : z
D :  That was r actually Robert 's idea . But anyhow .

dialogue type : z
D :  Um

dialogue type : s
D :  OK .

dialogue type : h
D :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  yeah , sure .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
D :  Um , so , I 've be just been looking at , um ,

dialogue type : s^fe
D :  Ack !

dialogue type : qh
D :  What are you doing ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
D :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I 've been looking at the PRM stuff .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so , this is , sort of like the latest thing I have on it ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  and

dialogue type : s
D :  I sorta constructed a couple of classes .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Like , a user class ,

dialogue type : s
D :  And I tried to simplify it down a little bit ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  so that I can actually um , look at it more .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's the same paper that I gave to Jerry last time .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so basically I took out a lot of stuff , a lot of the decision nodes ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  The red lines on the , um , graph are the um , relations between the different um , classes .

dialogue type : s
D :  Like , a user has like , a query ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and then , also has , you know um , reference slots to its preferences ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
D :  um , the special needs and , you know , money , and the user interest .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And so

dialogue type : s
D :  this is more or less similar to the flat Bayes - net that I have , you know , with the input nodes and all that .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  So I tried to construct the dependency models ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  and

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  a lot of these stuff I got from the flat Bayes - net ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
D :  and what they depend on ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  and it turns out , you know , the CPT 's are really big , if I do that ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so I tried to see how I can do , um put in the computational nodes in between .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  And what that would look like in a PRM .

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s^bc
D :  Actually , you know , a class of with different attributes that are the intermediate nodes ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and one of them is like , time affordability money affordability , site availability , and the travel compatibility .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  s some of these attributes only depend on stuff from , say , the user ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  or s f just from , I don't know , like the site .

dialogue type : s
D :  S like , um , these here ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  it 's only like , user ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but , if you look at travel compatibility for each of these factors , you need to look at a pair of , you know , what the um , preference of the user is

dialogue type : s^e
D :  versus , you know , what type of an event it is ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  or you know , which form of transportation the user has

dialogue type : s^e
D :  and whether , you know , the onsite parking matters to the user , in that case .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And that makes the scenario a little different in a PRM ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because , um , then you have one - user objects

dialogue type : s
D :  and potentially you can have many different sites in in mind .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And so

dialogue type : s
D :  for each of the site you 'll come up with this rating , of travel compatibility .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And , they all depend on the same users , but different sites ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'm tr I w I wa have been trying to see whether the PRM would make it more efficient if we do inferencing like that .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And so ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I guess you end up having fewer number of nodes than in a flat Bayes - net ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
D :  cuz otherwise you would c

dialogue type : s
D :  well , it 's probably the same .

dialogue type : fh
D :  But um ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^bc
D :  be able to re - use , like , um , all the user stuff ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and not not having to recompute a lot of the stuff ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because it 's all from the user side .

dialogue type : s
D :  So if you changed sites , you you can , you know , save some work on that .

dialogue type : fh
D :  But ,

dialogue type : s
D :  you know , in the case where , it depends on both the user and the site , then I 'm still having a hard time trying to see how um , using the PRM will help .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um , so anyhow , using those intermediate nodes then , this this would be the class that represent the intermediate nodes .

dialogue type : s
D :  And that would basically it 's just another class in the model ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  with , you know , references to the user and the site and the time .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  no the dependencies would of the queries would be reduced to this .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so , you know , it 's easier to specify the CPT and all .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um , so I think that 's about as far as I 've gone on the PRM stuff .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^m
D :  The output .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  OK . So it only makes two decisions , in this model .

dialogue type : s
D :  And one is basically how desirable a site is

dialogue type : s^e
D :  meaning , um , how good it matches the needs of a user .

dialogue type : s
D :  And the other is the mode of the visit ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  whether th It 's the EVA decision .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^cc^rt
D :  so , instead of um , doing a lot of , you know , computation about , you know , which one site it wants of the user wants to visit , I 'll come well , try to come up with like , sort of a list of sites .

dialogue type : s
D :  And for each site , you know , where h how how well it fits ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and basically a rating of how well it fits and what to do with it .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : qy^t
D :  Anything else I missed ?

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  No , not yet ,

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : b^rt
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^t3
D :  I can't really see the whole thing .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well I think I basically leave them to similar things .

dialogue type : s
D :  Some of the things might that might be different , maybe like are that the hours for the site .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And , eventually I meant that to mean whether they 're open at this hour or not .

dialogue type : s:s
D :  And status would be , you know , more or less like , whether they 're under construction ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  and and or stuff like that .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
D :  Which is the structural uncertainty ?

dialogue type : s
D :  I remember them learning when , you know , you don't know the structure for sure ,

dialogue type : s^no
D :  but I don't remember reading how you specify

dialogue type : s^e
D :  wh to start with .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  Actually I had to take out a lot of the complicated stuff ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  cuz I I made it really complicated in the beginning ,

dialogue type : fh|s:s
D :  and Jerry was like , " this is just too much " .
