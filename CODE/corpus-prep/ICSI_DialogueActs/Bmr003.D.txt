D :  So , I don't understand

dialogue type : z
D :  if it 's neck mounted you don't get very good performance .

dialogue type : z
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
D :  It it should be head mounted .

dialogue type : z
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : z
D : 

dialogue type : z

dialogue type : z
D :  OK , good .

dialogue type : z
D :  This is Beck on mike four .

dialogue type : z
D :  Yeah , but Eric , uh , you didn't think that was a reasonable hypothesis , right ?

dialogue type : z
D :  Oh , I 'm sorry y

dialogue type : z
D :  That was malarkey .

dialogue type : z
D :  No chance of that .

dialogue type : z
D :  Are - are yo are you recording where the table mikes are by the way ?

dialogue type : z
D : 

dialogue type : z
D :  Why not ?

dialogue type : z
D :  Why don't you just do this ?

dialogue type : z
D :  Four .

dialogue type : z
D :  Three .

dialogue type : z
D :  Wait till the projector gets installed .

dialogue type : z
D :  Cuz it 's gonna hang down , make noise .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt

dialogue type : qy^d^r^rt
D :  There 's interest up there ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Including the fan .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Did you notice the fan difference ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  Hear the difference ?

dialogue type : qr
D :  Do you wanna leave it off or not ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  Yeah , the You sure ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  things after the f then

dialogue type : s
D :  This fan 's wired backwards by the way .

dialogue type : s
D :  Uh , I think this is high speed here .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Well , not clear .

dialogue type : s^am
D :  Maybe it Maybe it isn't .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s
D :  I was wondering also , Get ready . whether the lights made any noise .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs^j
D :  So , do our meetings in the dark with no air conditioning in the future .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Short meetings ,

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  that 's right .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : %-
D :  Yeah , sort of r r

dialogue type : s^cs^j
D :  Tear t Tear your clothing off to stay cool .

dialogue type : s
D :  Actually , the a th air the air conditioning 's still working ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  that 's just an auxiliary fan .

dialogue type : %
D :  Tr

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  But far field means great distance ?

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  Not head mounted ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  And so that 's why they 're getting away with just two channels or something ,

dialogue type : qrr
D :  or are they using multiple DATs ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Still a point .

dialogue type : qy^d^j^rt
D :  That would be a meeting meeting meeting ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  Thi - this is the process of converting audio to text ?

dialogue type : qy^d
D :  And this requires humans just like the the STP stuff .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  I is there already some sort of plan in place for how this gonna be staffed or done ?

dialogue type : qrr
D :  Or is it real is that what we 're talking about here ?

dialogue type : qy^d
D :  Yourself ?

dialogue type : s^bu
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  And so you make Jane do the first one

dialogue type : s:s
D :  so then she can decide , oh , we don't need all this stuff ,

dialogue type : s:s
D :  just the words are fine .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Can't we get Joy to do it all ?

dialogue type : qy^df
D :  Is tha wasn't that what she was doing before ?

dialogue type : s^aa^j
D :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa^j
D :  that 's right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , the answer is zero .

dialogue type : s^j
D :  There 's a reason why he 's resisted .

dialogue type : fh
D :  But .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , we already we already We already have a plan in place for the first meeting .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : %
D : 

dialogue type : s^ng|s
D :  Well , i b but seriously , I I mean , Morgan 's obviously in a bind over this

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  and thing to do is just the field of dreams theory ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  which is we we go ahead as though there will be money at the time that we need the money .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  And that 's that 's the best we can do .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  i b To not do anything until we get money is is ridiculous .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  We 're not gonna do any get anything done if we do that .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , we have .

dialogue type : s^fa
D :  I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  So that 's where you came up with the f the ten X number ?

dialogue type : qrr
D :  Or is that really just a guess ?

dialogue type : %-
D :  Yeah i

dialogue type : qy.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s|qy^d^g
D :  it doesn't do any speech recognition does it ?

dialogue type : qy
D :  But but is there anyway to to wire a speech recognizer up to it

dialogue type : s^e.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , a couple things .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  First of all the time marking you 'd get you could get by a tool .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  And so if the if if the issue really

dialogue type : s^df
D :  uh , I 'm think about the close caption that you see running by on on live news casts .

dialogue type : %-
D :  You know , yo

dialogue type : s^na
D :  I know I know that .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  No , I understand .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  And in a lot of them you see typos and things like that ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  but it but it occurs to me that it may be a lot easier to correct things than it is to do things from scratch , no matter how wonderful the tool is .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Well s but but again the timing is for fr should be for free .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  Well I thought you just that 's said that was a critical issue .

dialogue type : %
D :  a

dialogue type : fg
D :  i a

dialogue type : fg
D :  ar but

dialogue type : qy
D :  Are are those d delays adjustable ?

dialogue type : qy^d^r
D :  Those delays adjustable ?

dialogue type : s^df
D :  See a lot of people who actually build stuff with human computer interfaces understand that delay ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
D : 

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Put put it on your sweater .

dialogue type : qrr
D :  Is this already in the past or already in the future ?

dialogue type : qy^d
D :  You 've already you 've already done some ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh - Oh , I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  good .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
D :  And forgetting all the words because you 've been thr

dialogue type : s^cs^j
D :  And then then w since we need some statistics do it three more .

dialogue type : s^df^j
D :  And so you 'll get you 'll get down to one point two X by the time you get done .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  No , but the thing is the fact that she 's she 's did it before just might give a lower bound .

dialogue type : s
D :  That 's all .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Uh , which is fine .

dialogue type : %
D : 

dialogue type : s^df
D :  And if the lower bound is nine X then w it 's a waste of time .

dialogue type : s
D :  A little double - blind - ear kind of thing .

dialogue type : s
D :  And the thing to keep in mind too about this tool , guys is that sure , you can do the computation for what we 're gonna do in the future

dialogue type : s
D :  but if if UW 's talking about doing two , or three , or five times as much stuff and they can use the same tool , then obviously there 's a real multiplier there .

dialogue type : s^co
D :  Well , use it .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Yeah , that 's why we s bought the expensive microphones .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^g
D :  But you didn't say anything worth while anyway , right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Using wh using stone age

dialogue type : s
D :  using stone age tools .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  D did you talk to anybody that does closed captioning for for uh , TV ?

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Cuz they a usually at the end of the show they 'll tell what the name of the company is , the captioning company that 's doing it .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Well , you know , the the thing the thing about this is thinking kind of , maybe a little more globally than I should here

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  but that really this could be a big contribution we could make .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Uh , I mean , we 've been through the STP thing ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  we know what it what it 's like to to manage the manage the process ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  and admittedly they might have been looking for more detail than what we 're looking for here

dialogue type : s
D :  but it was a it was a big hassle ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  right ?

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I mean , uh , you know , they they constantly could 've reminding people and going over it .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And clearly some new stuff needs to be done here .

dialogue type : s
D :  And it 's it 's only our time , where " our " of course includes Dan , Dan and you guys .

dialogue type : s
D :  It doesn't include me at all .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Uh .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : %
D :  Bec

dialogue type : qw
D :  Why ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  Because they wanted a lot more detail ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Only had two .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  So what took them so long ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  I see .

dialogue type : s
D :  But there 's still the same issue of managing the process , of of reviewing and keeping the files straight , and all this stuff , that which is clearly a hassle .

dialogue type : s^am.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Th - th the th there may be just multiplier for five people costs twice as much and for ten people co Something like that .

dialogue type : s
D :  A lot of companies I 've worked for y the , uh the person leading the meeting , the executive or whatever , would sort of go around the room and and mentally calculate h how many dollars per hour this meeting was costing ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
D :  right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  In university atmosphere you get a little different thing .

dialogue type : fh
D :  But

dialogue type : s^e
D :  you know , it 's a lot like , " he 's worth fifty an hour ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  he 's worth "

dialogue type : s:s
D :  And so he so here we 're thinking , " well let 's see , if the meeting goes another hour it 's going to be another thousand dollars . "

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  You know ?

dialogue type : %
D : 

dialogue type : s^co^j
D :  So ch So every everybody ta Talk really fast .

dialogue type : s^co^j
D :  Let 's get it over with .

dialogue type : %
D :  And

dialogue type : s^co^j
D :  only talk when you 're pointed to .

dialogue type : qw^d^rt
D :  And we 're talking about do doing how many hours worth of meetings ?

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  So thirty or forty thousand dollars .

dialogue type : b
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^fa
D :  Oh , I 'm sorry ,

dialogue type : s
D :  three hundred .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I w got an extra factor of three there .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^g
D :  The - these are not for engineering graduate students , right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s
D :  Just hypoth hypothetically assuming that that we go ahead and ended up using graduate students .

dialogue type : qw
D :  I who who 's the person in charge ?

dialogue type : qw
D :  Who 's gonna be the Steve here ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  You ?

dialogue type : s^j
D :  You know , it just means you have to stop working for Dave .

dialogue type : qy^d
D :  See ?

dialogue type : s^df^j
D :  That 's why Dave should have been here .

dialogue type : s^e^j
D :  To pr protect his people .

dialogue type : s^j:qy
D :  an an an and be and be sure and say , would you like fries with that when you 're thinking about your pay scale .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Is there a limit to the number of speakers ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Do y is this a , uh , university project ?

dialogue type : s|qy^d^g
D :  Th - this is the French software , right ?

dialogue type : %
D :  eh

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Uh , did you ask them to change the interface for more speakers ?

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Good .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Good .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Do - do you know what they 're using it for ?

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  Why 'd they develop it ?

dialogue type : qy
D :  Are they linguists ?

dialogue type : qr
D :  But I mean , are they are they linguists or are they speech recognition people ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Great .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Good .

dialogue type : s
D :  Their pre pre - lay .

dialogue type : qy^cs^d^rt
D :  Loop it ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Yo - you n you know , there 's al also the the user interface that 's missing .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  It 's missing from all of our offices ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  and that is some sort of analog input for something like this .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's what audio people actually use of course .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  It 's something that wh when you move your hand further , the sound goes faster past it ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  like fast forward .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  You know , like a joy stick

dialogue type : fh|s^e
D :  or a uh , you could wire a mouse or trackball to do something like that .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  No , but I 'm saying if this is what professionals who actually do this kind of thing for for for m for video or for audio where you you need to do this ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and so you get very good at sort of jostling back and forth , rather than hitting tab , and backspace , and carriage return , and enter , and things like that .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Ye - Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : %-

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : qw^ng

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : s^df

D : 

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  I see .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  I agree .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Cuz you 're gonna have to wor do the work sooner or later .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Even if it 's just writing things up .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  You know ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  d we we out of tape out of disk ?

dialogue type : s
D :  I I was looking for the actual box I plan to use ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but I c all I could I couldn't find it at the local store .

dialogue type : s
D :  But this is the the technology . It 's actually a little bit thinner than this .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  And it 's two by two , by one ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  and it would fit right under the right under th the the the the lip ,

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  There 's a lip in these tables .

dialogue type : s
D :  And , it oc I p especially brought the bottom along to try and generate some frequencies that you may not already have recorded .

dialogue type : s^co.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  But this was the uh just just to review ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I also brought this along rather than the projector so we can put these on the table , and sort of w push them around .

dialogue type : s
D :  That that 's the six tables that we 're looking at .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  These six tables here , with with little boxes sort of , uh , in the middle here .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , the the boxes are pretty much out of the way anyway .

dialogue type : s^cc.%--
D :  I 'll - I 'll show you the the cro

dialogue type : s
D :  this is the table cross section .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't know if people realize what they 're looking at .

dialogue type : qh
D :  Well why not ?

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I mean , cuz this is what 's gonna happen .

dialogue type : s^df^j
D :  You got plenty of data .

dialogue type : s^cc^j
D :  I won't come to your next meeting .

dialogue type : fg
D : 

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^j
D :  " Or not to be " .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Uh , the box , uh there 's a half inch lip here .

dialogue type : s
D :  The box is an inch thick

dialogue type : s
D :  so it hangs down a half an inch .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so the the two head set jacks would be in the front

dialogue type : s
D :  and then the little LED to indicate that that box is live .

dialogue type : s
D :  The the important issue about the LED is the fact that we 're talking about eight of these total , which would be sixteen channels .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And , uh , even though we have sixteen channels back at the capture , they 're not all gonna be used for this .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  So there 'd be a subset of them used for obviously j just use the ones at this end for for this many .

dialogue type : fg
D : 

dialogue type : s^fa
D :  Excuse me .

dialogue type : s
D :  you 'd like a a way to tell whether your box is live , so the LED wouldn't be on .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  So if you 're plugged in it doesn't work and the LED is off that 's that 's a tip off .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then the , uh would wire the all of the cables in a in a bundle come through here and o obviously collect these cables at the same time .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Uh , so this this notion of putting down the P Z Ms and taking them away would somehow have to be turned into leaving them on the table

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so the you we just epoxy them down or something .

dialogue type : s^e^j
D :  Big screw into the table .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and even though there 's eight cables they 're not really very big around

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
D :  yeah , that that stuff that people put with the little you slip the wires into that 's sort of shaped like that cross section .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'm I 'm r a I 'm going up and then I 'm going down .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na.%-
D :  Yeah , it 's like a speed bum An

dialogue type : s
D :  And they 're ac they 're actually ext extruded from plastic .

dialogue type : s
D :  They sorta look like this .

dialogue type : s
D :  So that the wires go through here .

dialogue type : fg
D :  So .

dialogue type : %
D :  s

dialogue type : s
D :  So it would c basically go on the diagonal here .

dialogue type : h|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Because they 're there .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  And to See , thi this is really the way people sit on this table .

dialogue type : %
D :  Th

dialogue type : fh
D :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
D :  Dot , dot , dot .

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  Well that that 's the way people sit .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  That 's how many chairs are in the room .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  And certainly you could do a thing where all sixteen were plugged in .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Uh if if you ha if you had nothing else .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  I agree .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  Oh , true enough .

dialogue type : s
D :  And actually , at the m my plan is to only bring eight wires out of this box .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Thi - thi thi this box is a one off deal .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Uh .

dialogue type : fh|s^df
D :  And , uh , it 's function is to s to , uh , essentially a wire converter to go from these little blue wires to these black wires ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  plus supply power to the microphones

dialogue type : s^df
D :  cuz the the he the , uh , cheap head mounteds all require low voltage .

dialogue type : %--
D :  Well I w I I

dialogue type : s
D :  the simplest thing I could imagine , i which is really , really simple is to quite literally that these things plug in .

dialogue type : s
D :  And there 's a there 's a plug on the end of each of these these , uh , ei eight cables .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  An - and there 's only there 's only four slots that are you know , in in the first version or the version we 're planning to to build .

dialogue type : s
D :  So that that was the whole issue with the LED ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  that you plug it in , the LED comes on , and and and you 're live .

dialogue type : s
D :  Now the the the subtle issue here is that tha I I haven't really figured out a solution for this .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , we it 'll have to be convention .

dialogue type : qw
D :  What happens if somebody unplugs this because they plug in more of something else ?

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Well the there 's no clever way to let the up stream guys know that you 're really not being powered .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  th there will be a certain amount of looking at cables has to be done if people , uh , rewire things .

dialogue type : fh
D :  But .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  How interesting .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  D did you do any recognition on the mix mix out ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
D :  Got the fifth ?

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
D :  Cool .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : qh^ba^rt
D :  Ain't science wonderful ?

dialogue type : fg
D : 

dialogue type : h
D :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
D :  well I was wrestling with th with literally the w number of connectors in the cable and the the , uh , powering system .

dialogue type : s
D :  And I I was gonna do this very clever phantom power

dialogue type : s
D :  and I decided a couple days ago not to do it .

dialogue type : s
D :  So I 'm ready to build it .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Which is to say , uh , the neighborhood of a week to get the circuit board done .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  I agree .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well I can build a cabinet .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  The the difficulty for this kind of project is the intellectual capital to design the cabinet .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  In other words , to figure out ex exactly what the right thing is .

dialogue type : s
D :  That cabinet can can go away .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
D :  We can use that for for uh kindling or something .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  But if you can imagine what the right form factor is .

dialogue type : s
D :  Dan - Dan and I have sort of gone around on this , and we were thinking about something that opened up in the top to allow access to the mixer for example .

dialogue type : s
D :  But there 's these things sticking out of the mixer which are kind of a pain ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^e
D :  if if you stuck the mixer up here and the top opened , it 'd be it 'd be fine .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : fh
D :  Well ,

dialogue type : qy^d.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  the the you can you can start start s sketching it out ,

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  and I can certainly build it out of oak

dialogue type : s^df
D :  no problem ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : h|s^na
D :  Well , the as we found out with the the thing that , uh , Jeff bought a long time ago to hold our stereo system the stuff you buy is total crap .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  And I mean this is something you buy .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk^m
D :  It 's total crap .

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  Well , it 's useless for this function .

dialogue type : s^aap^j
D :  Works fine for holding a Kleenex ,

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I I 'm paid for .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  I have no problem .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  No , but w certainly one of the issues is is the , uh is security .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  I mean , we 've been been been lax and lucky .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Really lucky with these things .

dialogue type : s
D :  But they 're not ours ,

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s^e
D :  the , uh the flat panels .

dialogue type : s^co^j.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Slipped almost slipped it by Dan .

dialogue type : qh^cs
D :  How about use the thing that um ACIRI 's doing .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Which is to say just laptop with a wireless .

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  What 's wrong with yours ?

dialogue type : s^df.%-
D : 

dialogue type : qw^br
D :  What ?

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  N no ,

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'm I 'm I 'm serious .

dialogue type : qy.%-
D : 

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah no no I 'm a I I I ain't joking here .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^df
D :  It 's very convenient especially if Dan happens to be sitting at that end of the table to not have to run down here and and look in the thing every so often ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's right there .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  The antenna 's right there ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Y I mean , we need obviously need to clear this with ACIRI

dialogue type : fh
D :  but , uh ,

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  how tough can that be ?

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^g^rt
D :  There it you 'd all you need 's web access , isn't it ?

dialogue type : s^e
D :  In in theory .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  great ,

dialogue type : s^ba^r
D :  great .

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  No ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  my my proposal is you have a laptop .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  You don't ?

dialogue type : qy^cs.%--
D : 

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
D :  Really ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
D :  Your new one ?

dialogue type : qw^br^d^rt
D :  I 'm sorry ?

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  I thought it just came through a serial p or an Ethernet port .

dialogue type : fg
D :  I e

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  But the two t

dialogue type : fg|s^ng
D :  Well , uh , b that to me that 's a whole nother . That 's a whole nother issue .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  The the idea of con convincing them that we should use their network i is fairly straight forward .

dialogue type : s^df^nd:qy
D :  The idea of being able to walk into their office and say , " oh , can I borrow your machine for a while " , is is is a non - starter .

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  That I I don't think that 's gonna work .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So , I mean , either either we figure out how to use a machine somebody already in the group already owns , a a and the idea is that if it 's it perk , you know , it 's an advantage not not a disadvan or else we we literally buy a machine e exactly for that purpose .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Certainly it solves a lot of the problems with leaving a monitor out here all the time .

dialogue type : s
D :  I I I I 'm I 'm not a big fan of doing things to the room that make the room less attractive for other people ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
D :  right ?

dialogue type : s^e
D :  Which is part of the reason for getting all this stuff out of the way

dialogue type : s^df.%--:qw.%--
D :  and and , so a monitor sitting here all the time you know people are gonna walk up to it and go , " how come I can't get , you know , Pong on this " or , whatev

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : fh|s^nd
D :  Well , the next conference they will .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
D :  Well , uh , the certainly , u you should give it a shot first See whether you you can get compatible stuff .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Uh , ask them what it costs .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Ask them if they have an extra one .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  Who knows , they might have an extra hardware s

dialogue type : s^ba
D :  Good .

dialogue type : h|%--
D :  Uh , the , uh Tsk .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's gonna be hooked up to all sorts of junk .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  There 's gonna be actually a a plug at the front that 'll connect to people 's laptops so you can walk in and plug it in .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  And it 's gonna be con connected to the machine at the back .

dialogue type : s
D :  So we certainly could use that as as a constant reminder of what the VU meters are doing .

dialogue type : s^e^j:s
D :  So people sitting here are going " testing , one , two , three " !

dialogue type : %-
D :  It a

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba^cs
D :  But but but I think the idea of having a control panel it 's that 's there in front of you is really cool .

dialogue type : %
D :  R

dialogue type : s^aap:qy^cs^rt
D :  As long as you d as l as long as you 're not tempted to sit there and f keep fiddling with the volume controls going , " can you talk a bit louder ? "

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
D :  And and it 's a a PCMCIA card , right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  PC card ,

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
D :  so you can have a slot ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  right ?

dialogue type : s^e^rt
D :  In your new machine ?

dialogue type : qy.%-
D :  Is it with s

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  Right ,

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  It 'll work the first time .

dialogue type : s
D :  I I trust Steve Jobs .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Uh , y yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  We we need to figure out what we want .

dialogue type : %
D : 

dialogue type : qw
D :  Hey , what are those green lights doing ?

dialogue type : s^co^fe^j
D :  Cut the red wire ,

dialogue type : s^fe^j
D :  the red wire !

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^j
D :  And it and the f the five thousand for the wires ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : %
D :  No .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  It 's a joke .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
D :  Oh , of the of the boards ?

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  sure ,

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Peanuts .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : qw
D :  What ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Oh , I thought like if we talked softer the disk lasts longer .

dialogue type : s^j
D :  It also helps if you talk in a monotone .

dialogue type : s^e^j
D :  Constant volume all the time .

dialogue type : s^m
D :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  Well it 's a choice if we get a choice , let 's keep talking .

dialogue type : b
D :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  No ,

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  I 'm done .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  But you you you there 's a problem a structural problem with this though .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  You really need an incentive at the end if you 're gonna do digits again .

dialogue type : s^cs^e^j
D :  Like , you know , candy bars or something ,

dialogue type : s^cs^e^j
D :  or or or or or a little , uh you know , toothbrushes like they give you at the d dentist .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
D :  Or both .

dialogue type : z
D :  Eric , you and I win .

dialogue type : z
D :  We didn't make any mistakes .

dialogue type : z
D :  No , I know .

dialogue type : z
D :  I 'm just giving you a hard time .

dialogue type : z
D :  Very good .

dialogue type : z
D :  So Eric , you win .

dialogue type : z
D :  But the other thing is that there 's a there 's a colon for transcripts .

dialogue type : z
D :  And there shouldn't be a colon .

dialogue type : z
D :  Because see , everything else is stuff you fill in .

dialogue type : z
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : z
D :  Automatically .

dialogue type : z
D :  But real

dialogue type : z
D :  Where 'd they come from ?

dialogue type : z
D :  Well , we think it doesn't matter .

dialogue type : z
D :  But the real question I have is that , why bother with these ?

dialogue type : z
D :  Why don't you just ask people to repeat numbers they already know ?

dialogue type : z
D :  Like phone numbers ,

dialogue type : z
D :  you know , social security numbers .

dialogue type : z
D :  I know .

dialogue type : z
D :  I kn

dialogue type : z
D :  Credit card numbers ,

dialogue type : z
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : z
D :  Yeah , so you just say say your credit card numbers ,

dialogue type : z
D :  say your phone numbers ,

dialogue type : z
D :  say your mother 's maiden name .

dialogue type : z
D :  You know pe

dialogue type : z
D :  people off the street .

dialogue type : z
D : 

dialogue type : z
D :  Mony on the mike .
