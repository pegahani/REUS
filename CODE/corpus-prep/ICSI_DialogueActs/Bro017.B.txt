dialogue type : z
B :  Is it starting now ?

dialogue type : z
B :  So what

dialogue type : z
B :  Whatever we say from now on , it can be held against us ,

dialogue type : z
B :  right ?

dialogue type : z
B :  and uh

dialogue type : z
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  So I I the the problem is that I actually don't know how th these held meetings are held ,

dialogue type : s
B :  if they are very informal and sort of just people are say what 's going on

dialogue type : %-
B :  and

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^t
B :  So I guess that what may be a reasonable is if I uh first make a report on what 's happening in Aurora in general , at least what from my perspective .

dialogue type : fg|s^rt
B :  And and uh so , I I think that Carmen and Stephane reported on uh Amsterdam meeting ,

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  which was kind of interesting

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  because it was for the first time we realized we are not friends really , but we are competitors .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Cuz until then it was sort of like everything was like wonderful

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  There is a plenty of there 're plenty of issues .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well and what happened was that they realized that if two leading proposals , which was French Telecom Alcatel , and us both had uh voice activity detector .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  And I said " well big surprise , I mean we could have told you that n n n four months ago , except we didn't because nobody else was bringing it up " .

dialogue type : s
B :  Obviously French Telecom didn't volunteer this information either ,

dialogue type : s
B :  cuz we were working on mainly on voice activity detector for past uh several months

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because that 's buying us the most uh thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  And everybody said " Well but this is not fair . We didn't know that . "

dialogue type : s
B :  And of course uh the it 's not working on features really .

dialogue type : sj
B :  And be I agreed .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  I said " well yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  you are absolutely right ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  or at least that if we could modify the recognizer , uh to account for these long silences ,

dialogue type : sj
B :  because otherwise uh that that th that wasn't a correct thing . "

dialogue type : fh|s:s
B :  And so then ev ev everybody else says " well we should we need to do a new eval evaluation without voice activity detector ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  or we have to do something about it " .

dialogue type : sj
B :  And in principle I uh I we agreed .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  We said uh " yeah " .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  but in that case , uh we would like to change the uh the algorithm

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because uh if we are working on different data , we probably will use a different set of tricks .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  But unfortunately nobody ever officially can somehow acknowledge that this can be done ,

dialogue type : s
B :  because French Telecom was saying " no , no , no , now everybody has access to our code ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so everybody is going to copy what we did . "

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah

dialogue type : s
B :  well our argument was everybody ha has access to our code , and everybody always had access to our code .

dialogue type : s
B :  We never uh uh denied that .

dialogue type : s
B :  We thought that people are honest , that if you copy something and if it is protected protected by patent then you negotiate , or something ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean , if you find our technique useful , we are very happy .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  But And French Telecom was saying " no , no , no ,

dialogue type : sj
B :  there is a lot of little tricks which uh sort of uh cannot be protected and you guys will take them , " which probably is also true .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  I mean , you know , it might be that people will take uh uh th the algorithms apart and use the blocks from that .

dialogue type : sj
B :  But I somehow think that it wouldn't be so bad , as long as people are happy abou uh uh uh honest about it .

dialogue type : sj
B :  And I think they have to be honest in the long run , because winning proposal again uh what will be available th is will be a code .

dialogue type : s
B :  So the uh the people can go to code and say " well listen this is what you stole from me "

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  you know ?

dialogue type : s^co
B :  " so let 's deal with that " .

dialogue type : s
B :  So I don't see the problem .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  The biggest problem of course is that f that Alcatel French Telecom cl claims " well we fulfilled the conditions .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  We are the best .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Uh . We are the standard . "

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  And e and other people don't feel that ,

dialogue type : s
B :  because they so they now decided that that is the whole thing will be done on well - endpointed data ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  essentially that somebody will endpoint the data based on clean speech ,

dialogue type : s
B :  because most of this the SpeechDat - Car has the also close speaking mike and endpoints will be provided .

dialogue type : fh|s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  still not clear if we are going to run the if we are allowed to run uh uh new algorithms ,

dialogue type : sj
B :  but I assume so .

dialogue type : s
B :  Because uh we would fight for that , really .

dialogue type : fh|%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  at least our experience is that only endpointing a a mel cepstrum gets uh gets you twenty - one percent improvement overall and twenty - seven improvement on SpeechDat - Car

dialogue type : s
B :  then obvious the database uh I mean the the the uh the baseline will go up .

dialogue type : s
B :  And nobody can then achieve fifty percent improvement .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Y yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Yeah but you have the same prob I mean MFCC basically has an enormous number of uh insertions .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And so , so now they want to say " we we will require fifty percent improvement only for well matched condition , and only twenty - five percent for the serial cases . "

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And uh and they almost agreed on that except that it wasn't a hundred percent agreed .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so last time uh during the meeting , I just uh brought up the issue ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I said " well you know uh quite frankly I 'm surprised how lightly you are making these decisions

dialogue type : s
B :  because this is a major decision .

dialogue type : s
B :  For two years we are fighting for fifty percent improvement

dialogue type : s
B :  and suddenly you are saying " oh no we we will do something less " ,

dialogue type : s^cs^t
B :  but maybe we should discuss that .

dialogue type : s
B :  And everybody said " oh we discussed that and you were not a mee there "

dialogue type : s:s
B :  and I said " well a lot of other people were not there because not everybody participates at these teleconferencing c things . "

dialogue type : s
B :  Then they said " oh no no no because uh everybody is invited . "

dialogue type : s
B :  However , there is only ten or fifteen lines , so people can't even con you know participate .

dialogue type : s
B :  So eh they agreed , and so they said " OK , we will discuss that . "

dialogue type : s
B :  Immediately Nokia uh raised the question

dialogue type : s
B :  and they said " oh yeah we agree this is not good to to uh dissolve the uh uh the uh the criterion . "

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  So now officially , Nokia is uh uh complaining and said they they are looking for support ,

dialogue type : fh|sj
B :  uh I think QualComm is uh saying , too " we shouldn't abandon the fifty percent yet .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  We should at least try once again , one more round . "

dialogue type : s^t
B :  So this is where we are .

dialogue type : sj
B :  I hope that I hope that this is going to be a adopted .

dialogue type : s
B :  Next Wednesday we are going to have uh another uh teleconferencing call , so we 'll see what uh where it goes .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  that 's what that 's a g very good uh point ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because David says " well you know we ca we can manipulate this number by choosing the right weights anyways . "

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So while you are right but uh you know but

dialogue type : fh
B :  Uh yeah ,

dialogue type : s
B :  if of course if you put a zero uh weight zero on a mismatched condition , or highly mismatched then then you are done .

dialogue type : s
B :  But weights were also deter already decided uh half a year ago .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : h|sj
B :  Well , of course people will not like it .

dialogue type : s
B :  Now What is happening now is that I th I think that people try to match the criterion to solution .

dialogue type : s
B :  They have solution .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : sj
B :  And I think that this is not the right way .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Eventually it may ha may ha it may have to happen .

dialogue type : s
B :  But it 's should happen at a point where everybody feels comfortable that we did all what we could .

dialogue type : sj
B :  And I don't think we did .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Basically , I think that that this test was a little bit bogus because of the data

dialogue type : s
B :  and uh essentially there were these arbitrary decisions made , and and everything .

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  So , so so this is so this is where it is .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  So what we are doing at OGI now is uh uh uh working basically on our parts which we I think a little bit neglected ,

dialogue type : s
B :  like noise separation .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh so we are looking in ways is in uh which uh with which we can provide better initial estimate of the mel spectrum basically ,

dialogue type : s
B :  which would be a l uh , f more robust to noise ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and so far not much uh success .

dialogue type : s
B :  We tried uh things which uh a long time ago Bill Byrne suggested ,

dialogue type : s
B :  instead of using Fourier spectrum , from Fourier transform , use the spectrum from LPC model .

dialogue type : s
B :  Their argument there was the LPC model fits the peaks of the spectrum , so it may be m naturally more robust in noise .

dialogue type : s
B :  And I thought " well , that makes sense , " but so far we can't get much much out of it .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^nd
B :  not not not much .

dialogue type : s
B :  Or even I was thinking about uh looking back into these totally ad - hoc techniques

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  like for instance uh Dennis Klatt was suggesting uh the one way to uh deal with noisy speech is to add noise to everything .

dialogue type : s
B :  So . I mean , uh uh add moderate amount of noise to all data .

dialogue type : s
B :  So that makes uh th any additive noise less addi less a a effective ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  And it was working at the time .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  It was kind of like one of these things , you know , but

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  if you think about it , it 's actually pretty ingenious .

dialogue type : s
B :  So well , you know , just take a take a spectrum and and and add of the constant , C , to every every value .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s
B :  And if if then if this data becomes noisy , it b it becomes eff effectively becomes less noisy basically .

dialogue type : s
B :  But of course you cannot add too much noise because then you 'll s then you 're clean recognition goes down ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but I mean it 's yet to be seen how much ,

dialogue type : sj
B :  it 's a very simple technique .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Yes indeed it 's a very simple technique ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  you just take your spectrum and and use whatever is coming from FFT , add constant ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  you know ?

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  on onto power spectrum .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Or the other thing is of course if you have a spectrum , what you can s start doing , you can leave start leaving out the p the parts which are uh uh low in energy

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and then perhaps uh one could try to find a a all - pole model to such a spectrum .

dialogue type : s
B :  Because a all - pole model will still try to to to put the the continuation basically of the of the model into these parts where the issue set to zero .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's what we want to try .

dialogue type : s
B :  I have a visitor from Brno .

dialogue type : s
B :  He 's a kind of like young faculty .

dialogue type : s
B :  pretty hard - working so he so he 's so he 's looking into that .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then most of the effort is uh now also aimed at this e e TRAP recognition .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  This uh this is this recognition from temporal patterns .

dialogue type : s^fe|s
B :  Ah , you don't know about TRAPS !

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah

dialogue type : %--
B :  I mean tha

dialogue type : s
B :  This is familiar like sort of because we gave you the name ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  but , what it is , is that normally what you do is that you recognize uh speech based on a shortened spectrum .

dialogue type : s
B :  Essentially L P - LPC , mel cepstrum , uh , everything starts with a spectral slice .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Uh so if you s So , given the spectrogram you essentially are sliding sliding the spectrogram along the uh f frequency axis

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and you keep shifting this thing , and you have a spectrogram .

dialogue type : s
B :  So you can say " well you can also take the time trajectory of the energy at a given frequency " ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and what you get is then , that you get a p vector .

dialogue type : s
B :  And this vector can be a a s assigned to s some phoneme .

dialogue type : s
B :  Namely you can say i it I will I will say that this vector will eh will will describe the phoneme which is in the center of the vector .

dialogue type : s
B :  And you can try to classify based on that .

dialogue type : %--
B :  And you so you classi

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  so it 's a very different vector , very different properties ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  we don't know much about it ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , so you get many decisions .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then you can start dec thinking about how to combine these decisions .

dialogue type : s
B :  Exactly , that 's what yeah , that 's what it is .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s^bsc
B :  uh twenty percent correct .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  You know ,

dialogue type : s
B :  on on like for the frame by frame basis ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so uh uh so it 's much better than chance .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's another thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well c currently we start I mean we start always with critical band spectrum .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  For various reasons .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  But uh the latest uh observation uh is that you you you are you can get quite a big advantage of using two critical bands at the same time .

dialogue type : s^aa^m
B :  Adjacent , adjacent .

dialogue type : s
B :  And the reasons there are some reasons for that .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  Because there are some reasons I can I could talk about , will have to tell you about things like masking experiments which uh uh uh uh yield critical bands ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and also experiments with release of masking , which actually tell you that something is happening across critical bands , across bands .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  It 's uh uh uh I mean time T - zero is one number , time t

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's a spectral energy , logarithmic spectral energy ,

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes , yes .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes , yes .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  And that 's what that 's what I 'm saying then ,

dialogue type : s.x
B :  so this is a this is a starting vector .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's just like shortened f spectrum , or something .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  But now we are trying to understand what this vector actually represents ,

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  for instance a question is like " how correlated are the elements of this vector ? "

dialogue type : s
B :  Turns out they are quite correlated , because I mean , especially the neighboring ones ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  They they represent the same almost the same configuration of the vocal tract .

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  So there 's a very high correlation .

dialogue type : s
B :  So the classifiers which use the diagonal covariance matrix don't like it .

dialogue type : s
B :  So we 're thinking about de - correlating them .

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  Then the question is uh " can you describe elements of this vector by Gaussian distributions " , or to what extent ?

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  And and and so on and so on .

dialogue type : s
B :  So we are learning quite a lot about that .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then another issue is how many vectors we should be using ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean the so the minimum is one .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  But I mean is the is the critical band the right uh uh dimension ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So we somehow made arbitrary decision , " yes " .

dialogue type : fh|s
B : 

dialogue type : sj
B :  This I somehow start to believe that 's what 's happening in recognition .

dialogue type : s^df^rt
B :  Cuz a lot of experiments point to the fact that people can split the signal into critical bands ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  but then oh uh uh

dialogue type : s
B :  so you can you are quite capable of processing a signal in uh uh independently in individual critical bands .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's what masking experiments tell you .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  But at the same time you most likely pay attention to at least neighboring bands

dialogue type : s
B :  when you are making any decisions , you compare what 's happening in in this band to what 's happening to the band to to to the to the neighboring bands .

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  And that 's how you make uh decisions .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's why the articulatory events , which uh F F Fletcher talks about , they are about two critical bands .

dialogue type : s
B :  You need at least two , basically .

dialogue type : s
B :  You need some relative , relative relation .

dialogue type : s
B :  Absolute number doesn't tell you the right thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  You need to you need to compare it to something else , what 's happening

dialogue type : s
B :  but it 's what 's happening in the in the close neighborhood .

dialogue type : s
B :  So if you are making decision what 's happening at one kilohertz , you want to know what 's happening at nine hundred hertz and it and maybe at eleven hundred hertz ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but you don't much care what 's happening at three kilohertz .

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  To some extent , it that is also true .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  But it 's but for but for instance , th uh uh what what uh humans are very much capable of doing is that if th if they are exactly the same thing happening in two neighboring critical bands , recognition can discard it .

dialogue type : qw
B : 

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Hey !

dialogue type : s
B :  OK , we need us another another voice here .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : sj
B :  I think so .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  And so so so for instance if you d if you a if you add the noise that normally masks masks the uh the the signal

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  and you can show that in that if the if you add the noise outside the critical band , that doesn't affect the the decisions you 're making about a signal within a critical band .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Unless this noise is modulated .

dialogue type : s
B :  If the noise is modulated , with the same modulation frequency as the noise in a critical band , the amount of masking is less .

dialogue type : s
B :  The moment you moment you provide the noise in n neighboring critical bands .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I start from from here ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so you you have uh no noise then you you you are expanding the critical band , so the amount of maching is increasing .

dialogue type : s
B :  And when you e hit a certain point , which is a critical band , then the amount of masking is the same .

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  So that 's the famous experiment of Fletcher , a long time ago .

dialogue type : s
B :  Like that 's where people started thinking " wow this is interesting ! "

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  But , if you if you if you modulate the noise , the masking goes up and the moment you start hitting the another critical band , the masking goes down .

dialogue type : s
B :  So essentially essentially that 's a very clear indication that that that cognition can take uh uh into consideration what 's happening in the neighboring bands .

dialogue type : s
B :  But if you go too far in a in a if you if the noise is very broad , you are not increasing much more ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so so if you if you are far away from the signal uh from the signal f uh the frequency at which the signal is , then the m even the when the noise is co - modulated it it 's not helping you much .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  So things like this we are kind of playing with with with the hope that perhaps we could eventually u use this in a in a real recognizer .

dialogue type : s
B :  Like uh partially of course we promised to do this under the the the Aurora uh program .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Probably not .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , maybe , most likely we will not have anything which c would comply with the rules .

dialogue type : %-
B :  like because uh uh

dialogue type : s
B :  latency currently chops the require uh significant uh latency amount of processing ,

dialogue type : s
B :  because uh we don't know any better , yet , than to use the neural net classifiers , uh and uh and uh TRAPS .

dialogue type : s
B :  Though the the work which uh everybody is looking at now aims at s trying to find out what to do with these vectors , so that a g simple Gaussian classifier would be happier with it .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  or to what extent a Gaussian classifier should be unhappy uh

dialogue type : s
B :  that , and how to Gaussian - ize the vectors ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  So this is uh what 's happening .

dialogue type : s
B :  Then Sunil is uh uh uh asked me f for one month 's vacation

dialogue type : s
B :  and since he did not take any vacation for two years , I had no I didn't have heart to tell him no .

dialogue type : s
B :  So he 's in India .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^j^ng
B :  Uh well , he may be looking for a girl , for for I don't I don't I don't ask .

dialogue type : s^j^rt
B :  I know that Naran - when last time Narayanan did that he came back engaged .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  I know .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  I know , I know ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then of course then what happened with Narayanan was that he start pushing me that he needs to get a PHD because they wouldn't give him his wife .

dialogue type : s
B :  And she 's very pretty and he loves her

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Oh yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  We had well I had a incentive because he he always had this plan except he never told me .

dialogue type : s
B :  Sort of figured that That was a uh that he uh he told me the day when we did very well at our NIST evaluations of speaker recognition , the technology , and he was involved there .

dialogue type : s
B :  We were after presentation we were driving home and he told me .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  So I I said " well , yeah , OK " so he took another another three quarter of the year but uh he was out .

dialogue type : sj
B :  So I wouldn't surprise me if he has a plan like that , though though uh Pratibha still needs to get out first .

dialogue type : s
B :  Cuz Pratibha is there a a year earlier .

dialogue type : s
B :  And S and Satya needs to get out very first because he 's he already has uh four years served ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  though one year he was getting masters .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : qw^bu^rt
B :  Which ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Speaker recognition ?

dialogue type : h|s
B :  Uh there , we don't know about evaluation ,

dialogue type : s^no
B :  next meeting is in June .

dialogue type : s
B :  And uh uh but like getting get together .

dialogue type : s^no
B :  Nobody said that yet .

dialogue type : sj^aa
B :  I assume so .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh yes , uh , but nobody even set up yet the date for uh delivering uh endpointed data .

dialogue type : s
B :  And this uh that that sort of stuff .

dialogue type : %--
B :  But I uh ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s^cs:s
B :  what I think would be of course extremely useful , if we can come to our next meeting and say " well you know we did get fifty percent improvement .

dialogue type : s
B :  If if you are interested we eventually can tell you how " , but uh we can get fifty percent improvement .

dialogue type : s
B :  Because people will s will be saying it 's impossible .

dialogue type : s^na^rt
B :  Twenty - two t twenty twenty - two percent better than the old baseline .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  u Yes .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : sj
B :  But I assume that it will be similar , I don't I I don't see the reason why it shouldn't be .

dialogue type : s
B :  I d I don't see reason why it should be worse .

dialogue type : s
B :  Cuz if it is worse , then we will raise the objection ,

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  we say " well you know how come ? "

dialogue type : s
B :  Because eh if we just use our voice activity detector , which we don't claim even that it 's wonderful , it 's just like one of them .

dialogue type : s
B :  We get this sort of improvement ,

dialogue type : qw
B :  how come that we don't see it on on on on your endpointed data ?

dialogue type : sj^aa
B :  I think so .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B :  C yeah uh

dialogue type : s^2
B :  and on clean speech data .

dialogue type : s
B :  David told me yesterday or Harry actually he told Harry from QualComm

dialogue type : s
B :  and Harry uh brought up the suggestion we should still go for fifty percent

dialogue type : s:qy
B :  he says are you aware that your system does only thirty percent uh comparing to to endpointed baselines ?

dialogue type : s
B :  So they must have run already something .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  And Harry said " Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  But I mean we think that we we didn't say the last word yet , that we have other other things which we can try . "

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  So . So there 's a lot of discussion now about this uh new criterion .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because Nokia was objecting , with uh QualComm 's we basically supported that , we said " yes " .

dialogue type : s.x
B :  Now everybody else is saying " well you guys might must be out of your mind . "

dialogue type : s
B :  uh The Guenter Hirsch who d doesn't speak for Ericsson anymore because he is not with Ericsson

dialogue type : s
B :  and Ericsson may not may withdraw from the whole Aurora activity because they have so many troubles now .

dialogue type : s
B :  Ericsson 's laying off twenty percent of people .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  he got a job uh at some some Fachschule , the technical college not too far from Aachen .

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's like professor u university professor

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  you know , not quite a university , not quite a sort of it 's not Aachen University , but it 's a good school and he he 's happy .

dialogue type : s
B :  And he well , he was hoping to work uh with Ericsson like on t uh like consulting basis ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but right now he says says it doesn't look like that anybody is even thinking about speech recognition .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  They think about survival .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  So . But this is being now discussed right now ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and it 's possible that uh that that it may get through , that we will still stick to fifty percent .

dialogue type : s
B :  But that means that nobody will probably get this im this improvement .

dialogue type : s
B :  yet , wi with the current system .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Which event es essentially I think that we should be happy with

dialogue type : s
B :  because that that would mean that at least people may be forced to look into alternative solutions

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : qy.%--
B : 

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  How did you come up with this number ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  If you improve twenty by twenty percent the c the f the all baselines , it 's just a quick c comp co computation ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : sj
B :  I think it 's about right .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So we were just discussing , since you mentioned that , in it w

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  driving in the car with Morgan this morning , we were discussing a good experiment for b for beginning graduate student who wants to run a lot of who wants to get a lot of numbers on something

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  which is , like , " imagine that you will you will start putting every co any coefficient , which you are using in your vector , in some general power .

dialogue type : s
B :  General pow power .

dialogue type : s
B :  Like sort of you take a s power of two , or take a square root , or something .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So suppose that you are working with a s C - zer C - one .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So if you put it in a s square root , that effectively makes your model half as efficient .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because uh your uh Gaussian mixture model ,

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  computes the mean .

dialogue type : %--
B :  And and uh i i i

dialogue type : s
B :  but it 's the mean is an exponent of the whatever , the the this Gaussian function .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  So you 're compressing the range of this coefficient , so it 's becoming less efficient .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  Morgan was @ @ and he was he was saying well this might be the alternative way how to play with a with a fudge factor ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f
B :  you know ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  you know , just compress the whole vector .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  because in old days we were doing when when people still were doing template matching and Euclidean distances , we were doing this liftering of parameters ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  because we observed that uh higher parameters were more important than lower for recognition .

dialogue type : s
B :  And basically the the C - ze C - one contributes mainly slope ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and it 's highly affected by uh frequency response of the of the recording equipment and that sort of thing ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  so we were coming with all these f various lifters .

dialogue type : s
B :  uh Bell Labs had he this uh uh r raised cosine lifter which still I think is built into H HTK for reasons n unknown to anybody ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  but but uh we had exponential lifter , or triangle lifter , basic number of lifters .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
B :  And . But so they may be a way to to fiddle with the f with the f

dialogue type : s^aap^m
B :  Insertions , deletions , or the the giving a relative uh basically modifying relative importance of the various parameters .

dialogue type : s
B :  The only of course problem is that there 's an infinite number of combinations

dialogue type : %-
B :  and if the if you s if y

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  Yeah , you need a lot of graduate students , and a lot of computing power .

dialogue type : b
B :  I know .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Exactly .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  If you were at Bell Labs or I d d

dialogue type : s
B :  I shouldn't be saying this in on on a mike ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Or I uh IBM ,

dialogue type : sj
B :  that 's what maybe that 's what somebody would be doing .

dialogue type : s
B :  Oh , I mean , I mean the places which have a lot of computing power ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so because it is really it 's a p it 's a it 's it will be reasonable search

dialogue type : fh
B :  uh

dialogue type : sj
B :  but I wonder if there isn't some way of doing this uh search like when we are searching say for best discriminants .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Absolutely .

dialogue type : s
B :  And hev everything is fixed .

dialogue type : s^r
B :  Everything is fixed .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  For both , you would have to do .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^r
B :  You have to do bo both .

dialogue type : s
B :  Because essentially you are saying " uh this feature is not important " .

dialogue type : s
B :  Or less important ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so that 's th that 's a that 's a painful one ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  But but wait a minute .

dialogue type : s
B :  You may not need to re uh uh retrain the m model .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  You just may n may need to c uh give uh less weight to to uh a mod uh a component of the model which represents this particular feature .

dialogue type : s
B :  You don't have to retrain it .

dialogue type : s^2
B :  You just multiply .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^m^na
B :  You modify the Gaussian in the model ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  but in the in the test data you would have to put it in the power ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but in a training what you c in a training uh in trained model , all you would have to do is to multiply a model by appropriate constant .

dialogue type : s
B :  Because in uh test in uh test data you ca don't have a model .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  You have uh only data .

dialogue type : %-
B :  But in a in a tr

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  That is true ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but w I mean , so what you want to do You want to say if uh obs you if you observe something like Stephane observes , that C - one is not important , you can do two things .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  If you have a trained trained recognizer , in the model , you know the the the the component which I I mean di dimension wh

dialogue type : s^na
B :  To the s you you know it .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  But what I 'm proposing now , if it is important but not as important , you multiply it by point one in a model .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I would I would have to look in the in the math ,

dialogue type : qw.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's what you do .

dialogue type : s^r
B :  That 's what you do , you you you modify the standard deviation as it was trained .

dialogue type : s
B :  Effectively you , you know y in f in front of the of the model , you put a constant .

dialogue type : s
B :  S yeah effectively what you 're doing is you is you are modifying the the the deviation .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa^m
B :  the spread .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
B :  Your als

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  By making it narrower ,

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes ,

dialogue type : s^bs
B :  so you making this particular dimension less important .

dialogue type : s
B :  Because see what you are fitting is the multidimensional Gaussian ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's a it has it has uh thirty - nine dimensions , or thirteen dimensions if you g ignore deltas and double - deltas .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  So in order if you in order to make dimension which which Stephane sees uh less important , uh uh I mean not not useful , less important , what you do is that this particular component in the model you can multiply by w you can you can basically de - weight it in the model .

dialogue type : s
B :  But you can't do it in a in a test data

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because you don't have a model for th I mean uh when the test comes ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  but what you can do is that you put this particular component in and and you compress it .

dialogue type : s
B :  That becomes uh th gets less variance , subsequently becomes less important .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  That would be very bad ,

dialogue type : s^df.%--
B :  because uh your t your model was trained uh expecting uh ,

dialogue type : sj
B :  that wouldn't work .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because your model was trained expecting a certain var variance on C - one .

dialogue type : s
B :  And because the model thinks C - one is important .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  After you train the model , you sort of y you could do you could do still what I was proposing initially ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  that during the training you you compress C - one that becomes then it becomes less important in a training .

dialogue type : s
B :  But if you have if you want to run e ex extensive experiment without retraining the model , you don't have to retrain the model .

dialogue type : s
B :  You train it on the original vector .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  But after , you wh when you are doing this parametric study of importance of C - one you will de - weight the C - one component in the model ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and you will put in the you will compress the this component in a in the test data . s by the same amount .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No ,

dialogue type : s
B :  that would be a severe mismatch ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  what you are proposing ?

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  N no you don't want that .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because that would then your model would be unlikely .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Your likelihood would be low ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Because you would be providing severe mismatch .

dialogue type : sj^ba
B :  No that would be very good match ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  I see what you are sa saying ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but

dialogue type : fh|s^ar
B :  uh , no , no I don't think that it would be the same .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^ar^co
B :  No , you can't do that .

dialogue type : s^ar^co
B :  Y you ca you ca Ch - Chuck , you can't do that .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because that would be a really f fiddling with the data ,

dialogue type : s^co
B :  you can't do that .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B :  But what you can do , I 'm confident you ca

dialogue type : s
B :  well , I 'm reasonably confident and I putting it on the record ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^j
B :  I mean y people will listen to it for for centuries now ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  is what you can do , is you train the model uh with the with the original data .

dialogue type : s
B :  Then you decide that you want to see how important C C - one is .

dialogue type : s
B :  So what you will do is that a component in the model for C - one , you will divide it by by two .

dialogue type : s
B :  And you will compress your test data by square root .

dialogue type : s
B :  Then you will still have a perfect m match .

dialogue type : s
B :  Except that this component of C - one will be half as important in a in a overall score .

dialogue type : s
B :  Then you divide it by four and you take a square , f fourth root .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^rt
B :  Yeah , multiply this component uh i it by number b larger than one ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and you put your data in power higher than one .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Then it becomes more important . In the overall score , I believe .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh , since it is on the record , I can't say uh which company it was ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but it was reported to me that uh somebody visited a company

dialogue type : s^j
B :  and during a d during a discussion , there was this guy who was always hitting the carriage returns uh on a computer .

dialogue type : s^j:qw
B :  So after two hours uh the visitor said " wh why are you hitting this carriage return ? "

dialogue type : s^j
B :  And he said " well you know , we are being paid by a computer ty I mean we are we have a government contract .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  And they pay us by by amount of computer time we use . "

dialogue type : s^j
B :  It was in old days when there were uh of PDP - eights and that sort of thing .

dialogue type : s
B :  Because so they had a they literally had to c monitor at the time at the time on a computer how much time is being spent I i i or on on this particular project .

dialogue type : s
B :  Nobody was looking even at what was coming out .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , I know ,

dialogue type : b

B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I knew some people who were uh that was in old Communist uh Czechoslovakia ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  so we were watching for American airplanes , coming to spy on on uh on us at the time ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so there were three guys uh uh stationed in the middle of the woods on one l lonely uh watching tower , pretty much spending a year and a half there because there was this service

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And so they very quickly they made friends with local girls and local people in the village

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  and so but they there was one plane flying over s always uh uh above ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and so that was the only work which they had .

dialogue type : s
B :  They like four in the afternoon they had to report there was a plane from Prague to Brno Basically f flying there ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so they f very q f first thing was that they would always run back and and at four o ' clock and and quickly make a call , " this plane is uh uh passing "

dialogue type : s
B :  then a second thing was that they they took the line from this u u post to uh uh a local pub .

dialogue type : s
B :  And they were calling from the pub .

dialogue type : s
B :  And they but third thing which they made , and when they screwed up , they finally they had to p the the p the pub owner to make these phone calls because they didn't even bother to be there anymore .

dialogue type : s
B :  And one day there was there was no plane .

dialogue type : s
B :  At least they were sort of smart enough that they looked if the plane is flying there ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And the pub owner says " oh my four o ' clock , OK , quickly p pick up the phone , call that there 's a plane flying . "

dialogue type : s
B :  There was no plane for some reason ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it was downed ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  so they got in trouble .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But . But uh .

dialogue type : b
B :  So . So . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Well , at least go test the s test the uh assumption about C - C - one I mean to begin with .

dialogue type : s
B :  But then of course one can then think about some predictable result to change all of them .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's just like we used to do these uh these uh um the the uh distance measures .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Because you see , I mean , what is happening here in a in a in a in such a model is that it 's tells you yeah what has a low variance uh is uh is uh is more reliable ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : qw.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw
B :  How do we know , especially when it comes to noise ?

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s^aa.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah that 's why uh people used these lifters were inverse variance weighting lifters basically that makes uh uh Euclidean distance more like uh Mahalanobis distance with a diagonal covariance when you knew what all the variances were over the old data .

dialogue type : s
B :  What they would do is that they would weight each coefficient by inverse of the variance .

dialogue type : s
B :  Turns out that uh the variance decreases at least at fast , I believe , as the index of the cepstral coefficients .

dialogue type : s
B :  I think you can show that uh uh analytically .

dialogue type : s
B :  So typically what happens is that you you need to weight the uh weight the higher coefficients more than uh the lower coefficients .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : %--
B :  When Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  When we talked about Aurora still I wanted to m make a plea uh encourage for uh more communication between between uh uh different uh parts of the distributed uh uh center .

dialogue type : s
B :  Uh even when there is absolutely nothing to to s to say but the weather is good in Ore - in in Berkeley .

dialogue type : s
B :  I 'm sure that it 's being appreciated in Oregon and maybe it will generate similar responses down here ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  What you know , nowadays ,

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's actually do - able , almost .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  I don't think so .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  So we should do that .

dialogue type : s^co
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah , that would make it easier .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then we also can send the the dis to the same address

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  and it goes to everybody

dialogue type : s
B :  Because what 's happening naturally in research , I know , is that people essentially start working on something and they don't want to be much bothered ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  but what the the then the danger is in a group like this , is that two people are working on the same thing and i c of course both of them come with the s very good solution , but it could have been done somehow in half of the effort or something .

dialogue type : s^t
B :  Oh , there 's another thing which I wanted to uh uh report .

dialogue type : s
B :  Lucash , I think , uh wrote the software for this Aurora - two system .

dialogue type : sj
B :  reasonably uh good one , because he 's doing it for Intel ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but I trust that we have uh rights to uh use it uh or distribute it and everything .

dialogue type : s
B :  Cuz Intel 's intentions originally was to distribute it free of charge anyways .

dialogue type : fh|s^cc
B :  u s And so so uh we we will make sure that at least you can see the software and if if if if it is of any use .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : sj
B :  It might be a reasonable point for p perhaps uh start converging .

dialogue type : s
B :  Because Morgan 's point is that He is an experienced guy .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  He says " well you know it 's very difficult to collaborate if you are working with supposedly the same thing , in quotes , except which is not s is not the same .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  Which which uh uh one is using that set of hurdles , another one set is using another set of hurdles .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  So . And And then it 's difficult to c compare .

dialogue type : s
B :  He got the he got the software .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah . They sent the release .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b

B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Yeah because Intel paid us uh

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  should I say on a microphone ?

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  uh some amount of money , not much .

dialogue type : s
B :  Not much I can say on a microphone .

dialogue type : sj
B :  Much less then we should have gotten for this amount of work .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  they use actu actually some Intel libraries , but in the process , Lucash just rewrote the whole thing because he figured rather than trying to f make sense uh of uh including ICSI software uh not for training on the nets

dialogue type : s
B :  but I think he rewrote the the the or so maybe somehow reused over the parts of the thing so that so that the whole thing , including MLP , trained MLP is one piece of uh software .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Is it useful ?

dialogue type : fh.%
B :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's what he was saying ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  right .

dialogue type : s
B :  He said that it was like it was like just so many libraries and nobody knew what was used when ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and and so that 's where he started and that 's where he realized that it needs to be needs to be uh uh at least cleaned up ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and so I think it this is available .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B :  uh e ev

dialogue type : s^am
B :  n not maybe Maybe not in a first maybe not in a first ap approximation

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  I I can check on that .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
B :  And uh in otherwise the Intel libraries , I think they are available free of f freely .

dialogue type : s
B :  But they may be running only on on uh on uh Windows .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa^m
B :  Yeah , on Intel architecture , may not run in SUN .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  That is p that is that is possible .

dialogue type : s
B :  That 's why Intel of course is distributing it ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I know there was some issues that initially of course we d do all the development on Linux

dialogue type : s
B :  but we use we don't have we have only three uh uh uh uh s SUNs

dialogue type : s
B :  and we have them only because they have a SPERT board in .

dialogue type : s
B :  Otherwise otherwise we t almost exclusively are working with uh PC 's now , with Intel .

dialogue type : s
B :  In that way Intel succeeded with us , because they gave us too many good machines for very little money or nothing .

dialogue type : s
B :  So . So . So we run everything on Intel .

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  No .

dialogue type : b
