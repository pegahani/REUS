dialogue type : s
E :  Are you you were going to say why what made you wh what led you to do that .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
E :  St - Stephane .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Getting close .

dialogue type : b.%
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qw^t^tc
E :  Out of curiosity , what what kind of recognizer is the one from Mississippi State ?

dialogue type : qy.%-
E :  Is it ?

dialogue type : qy
E :  Um , is it like a Gaussian mixture model ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^rt^tc
E :  As as we were talking about this I was thinking , um , whether there 's a relationship between um , between Michael 's approach to , uh , some some sort of optimal brain damage or optimal brain surgeon on the neural nets .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  So , like , if we have ,

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  and presumably the neural nets are are learning some sort of a nonlinear mapping , uh , from the the the features to to this this probability posterior space .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
E :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  And , um and each of the hidden units is learning some sort of some sort of some sort of pattern .

dialogue type : s^f
E :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
E :  And it could be , like like these , um these auditory patterns that Michael is looking at .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then when you 're looking at the the , uh , um , the best features , you know , you can take out you can do the do this , uh , brain surgery by taking out , um , hidden units that don't really help at all .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , that sort of segues into what what I 'm doing .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um , so , uh , the big picture is k um , come up with a set of , uh , intermediate categories ,

dialogue type : s
E :  then build intermediate category classifiers , then do recognition ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and , um , improve speech recognition in that way .

dialogue type : s
E :  Um , so right now I 'm in in the phase where I 'm looking at at , um , deciding on a initial set of intermediate categories .

dialogue type : s
E :  And I 'm looking for data data - driven methods that can help me find , um , a set of intermediate categories of speech that , uh , will help me to discriminate later down the line .

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : s^e
E :  train train an ordinary neural net to uh , to learn the posterior probabilities of phones .

dialogue type : fh
E :  And so ,

dialogue type : s
E :  um , at the end of the day you have this neural net

dialogue type : s
E :  and it has hidden hidden units .

dialogue type : s
E :  And each of these hidden units is um , is learning some sort of pattern .

dialogue type : qh
E :  And so , um , what what are these patterns ?

dialogue type : s^no
E :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  uh , presumably those are important patterns for discriminating between phone classes .

dialogue type : s
E :  And maybe maybe some , uh , intermediate categories can come from just looking at the patterns of um , that the neural net learns .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Um .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Yeah , so so that 's the that 's the first part uh , one one of the ideas to get at some some patterns of intermediate categories .

dialogue type : s
E :  Um , the other one was , um , to , uh , come up with a a a model um , a graphical model , that treats the intermediate categories as hidden hidden variables , latent variables , that we don't know anything about ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but that through , um , s statistical training and the EM algorithm , um , at the end of the day , we have , um we have learned something about these these latent , um latent variables

dialogue type : s^e
E :  which happen to correspond to intermediate categories .

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  Um . Yeah , and so those are the the two directions that I 'm I 'm looking into right now .

dialogue type : fh
E :  And , uh , um Yeah .

dialogue type : s^tc
E :  I guess that 's that 's it .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  Oh , tea time ?

dialogue type : s^fe
E :  Oops .
