dialogue type : z
F :  OK .

dialogue type : z
F :  Great . Great .

dialogue type : z
F :  So the what w we h have been doing i

dialogue type : z
F :  they would like us all to read these digits .

dialogue type : z
F :  But we don't all read them

dialogue type : z
F :  but a couple people read them .

dialogue type : z
F :  Uh , wanna give them all with German accents today or ?

dialogue type : z
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^t^tc
F :  OK . Let 's be done with this .

dialogue type : s^tc
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  And this is Tilman and Ralf .

dialogue type : s
F :  Hi .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  So we 're gonna try to finish by five so people who want to can go hear Nancy Chang 's talk , uh downstairs .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  And you guys are g giving talks on tomorrow and Wednesday lunch times ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  That 's great .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  OK so , do y do you know what we 're gonna do ?

dialogue type : s^bk|sj^ba
F :  OK So That sounds good .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Johno , are you gonna have some time t to do that uh w with these guys ?

dialogue type : sj^ba^df
F :  cuz y you 're the grammar maven .

dialogue type : sj^bu
F :  I mean it makes sense ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  doesn't it ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah Good .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  So , I think that 's probably the the right way to do that .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And an

dialogue type : s
F :  Yeah , so I I actually wanna f to find out about it too ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but I may not have time to get in .

dialogue type : s^bk|sj^ba^rt
F :  OK that sounds great .

dialogue type : b
F :  Great .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  So , you guys enjoy your weekend ?

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^rt
F :  OK , before before you got put to work ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Great .

dialogue type : s^tc.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Sort of one branch is to get us caught up on what 's going on .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  Also of course it would be really nice to know what the plans are , in addition to what 's sort of already in code .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  and we can d

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I dunno

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  w w was there uh a time when we were set up to do that ?

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  It probably will work better if we do it later in the week , after we actually understand uh better what 's going on .

dialogue type : qw
F :  So when do you guys leave ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , OK ,

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fg
F : 

dialogue type : s^cc
F :  so anyt we 'll find a time later in the week to uh get together and talk about your understanding of what SmartKom plans are .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and how we can change them .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  OK ?

dialogue type : h|s
F :  um What what does not work for me is Thursday afternoon .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  I can do earlier in the day on Thursday , or um most of the time on Friday ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  not all .

dialogue type : qo^rt
F :  Wha - but , Johno ,

dialogue type : qw
F :  what are your constraints ?

dialogue type : qy^cs^d^rt
F :  Eleven ?

dialogue type : qy^d^r^rt
F :  Eleven on Thursday ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right . Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  This is then out of deference to our non - morning people .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  And actually we can invite um Andreas as well .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh that 's true .

dialogue type : s
F :  He 's off off on his trip already .

dialogue type : s
F :  Thilo .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK well yeah

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  maybe we 'll see if David could make it .

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  That would be good .

dialogue type : %-
F :  Well th uh

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No no .

dialogue type : sj^cs
F :  It 's a good time to pause .

dialogue type : s
F :  I s I see questions on peoples ' faces ,

dialogue type : qh^cs.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s^bc
F :  That 's what it should do .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : %--
F :  let 's let 's

dialogue type : %--
F :  That w

dialogue type : s^t^tc
F :  OK that was one question .

dialogue type : qy.%--
F :  Is there other other things that

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz we wanna not Pa - pass over any you know , questions or concerns that you have .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  So well , let me Let me s expand on that a little bit from the point of view of the generation .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So the idea is that we 've actually got this all laid out an and we could show it to you ig

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  There 's a first cut at a belief - net that that doesn't it isn't fully uh instantiated ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and in particular some of the the combination rules and ways of getting the the conditional probabilities aren't there .

dialogue type : s
F :  But we believe that we have laid out the fundamental decisions in this little space

dialogue type : s
F :  and the things that influence them .

dialogue type : s
F :  So one of the decisions is what we call this AVE thing .

dialogue type : qh
F :  Do you want to um access , view or enter a thing .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that 's a a discrete decision .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  what one would like is for this uh , knowledge modeling module to add which of those it is and give it to the planner .

dialogue type : s
F :  But , uh th the current design suggests that if it seems to be an important decision and if the belief - net is equivocal so that it doesn't say that one of these is much more probable than the other , then an option is to go back and ask for the information you want .

dialogue type : qy^d^f
F :  Alright ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Now there are two ways one can go a imagine doing that .

dialogue type : s
F :  For the debugging we 'll probably just have a a drop - down menu

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  But for a full system , then one might very well formulate a query ,

dialogue type : s:qy
F :  give it to the dialogue planner and say this , you know ar are you know you are you planning to enter ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Or whatever it whatever that might be .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that 's under that model

dialogue type : s
F :  then , There would be a uh um a loop in which this thing would formulate a query ,

dialogue type : s
F :  presumably give it to you .

dialogue type : s
F :  That would get expressed and then hopefully you know , you 'd get an answer back .

dialogue type : s
F :  And that would of course the answer would have to be parsed .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  right

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  OK so , th that uh ,

dialogue type : s
F :  We probably won't do this early on , because the current focus is more on the decision making and stuff like that .

dialogue type : s
F :  But While we 're on the subject I just wanted to give you a sort of head 's up that it could be that some months from now we said " OK we 're now ready to try to close that loop " in terms of querying about some of these decisions .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  D did you know this Robert ?

dialogue type : s
F :  So we ha we have to get in on that .

dialogue type : s
F :  because um partly those are like X - schemas .

dialogue type : s
F :  the transition diagrams .

dialogue type : s
F :  And it may be that that um we should early on make sure that they have the flexibility that we need .

dialogue type : s
F :  So there 's ac so there th the word " action " , OK , is is what 's ambiguous here .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  So , um one thing is there 's an actual planner that tells the person in the tourist domain now ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  per tells the person how to go ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  " First go here ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  first go there

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  uh , you know , take a bus " ,

dialogue type : s
F :  whatever it is .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that 's that form of planning , and action , and a route planner and GIS , all sort of stuff .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  uh But I think that isn't what you mean .

dialogue type : fg|s^bk
F :  Well , OK ,

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  so that 's what I thought .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  So action he action here means dia uh speech ac uh you know dialogue act .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Um , I think tha I think it 's not going to I think that 's not going to be good enough .

dialogue type : s
F :  I I don what uh what I meant by that .

dialogue type : s
F :  So I think the idea of having a , you know , transition diagram for the grammar of conversations is a good idea .

dialogue type : s^f
F :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
F :  And I think that we do hav definitely have to get in on it and find out OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  But I think that um

dialogue type : s
F :  when so , when you get to the tourist domain it 's not just an information retrieval system .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  people are gonna have to think this through a bit more carefully .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So , if it 's only like in in the in the film and T V thing ,

dialogue type : s
F :  OK , you can do this .

dialogue type : s
F :  And you just get information and give it to people .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  But what happens when you actually get them moving and so forth and so on

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh , y y your I d I think the notion of this as a self contained uh module

dialogue type : s
F :  you know th the functional module that that interacts with with where the tourism g stuff is going probably is too restrictive .

dialogue type : s
F :  Now I dunno how much people have thought ahead to the tourist domain in this

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Indeed .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^t3
F :  Could you could you put a message into the right place to see if we can at least ask that question ?

dialogue type : fg|s^aa
F :  Yeah , th there there I think there are a lot of reasons why it matters .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  so that

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
F :  for example , the i it 's the action planner is going to take some spec and s make some suggestions about what the user should do .

dialogue type : s
F :  What the user says after that is going to be very much caught up with what the action planner told it .

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
F :  If the If the parser and the language end doesn't know what the person 's been told

dialogue type : s^f^rt
F :  OK

dialogue type : s
F :  th it 's you 're making your life much more difficult than it has to be .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
F :  So if someone says the best t to uh go there is by taxi ,

dialogue type : s
F :  let 's say .

dialogue type : s
F :  Now the planner comes out and says you wanna get there fast ,

dialogue type : s
F :  take a taxi .

dialogue type : s^f
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  And the language end doesn't know that .

dialogue type : s
F :  OK , there 's all sorts of dialogues that won't make any sense which would be just fine .

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  Yeah , but this is not the st this is not just the state of the discourse .

dialogue type : s
F :  This is actually the state of the plan .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  That 's why

dialogue type : fh
F :  OK so it z

dialogue type : fg
F :  and s

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  uh , It 's great if people are already taking that into account .

dialogue type : s
F :  But One would have t have to see see the details .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  So anyway , Robert , that 's why I was thinking that

dialogue type : fh
F :  um

dialogue type : s^rt.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  We talked about this several times that that the the input end is gonna need a fair amount of feedback from the planning end .

dialogue type : s
F :  In in one of these things which are are much more continuous than the just the dialogue over movies and stuff .

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
F :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : qy
F :  Would there be any chance of getting the terminology changed so that the dialogue planner was called a " dialogue planner " ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Because there 's this other thing The o There 's this other thing in in the tourist domain which is gonna be a route planner

dialogue type : s
F :  or It 's really gonna be an action planner .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa^rt
F :  I would think ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : qw^br
F :  Huh ?

dialogue type : qw^cs
F :  So , s So what would happen if we sent a note saying " Gee we 've talked about this and couldn't we change this uh th the whole word ? "

dialogue type : s^df^no
F :  I have no idea how complicated these things are .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^t.%--
F :  anyway .

dialogue type : s
F :  I if if that c in persists then we 're gonna need another term . for the thing that actually does the planning of the uh routes and whatever we are doing for the tourist .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ar.%--
F :  Yeah , but that 's not g eh tha

dialogue type : s^ng
F :  That ha has all the wrong connotations .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  it 's it sounds like it 's you know stand alone .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  It doesn't interact ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  it doesn't

dialogue type : s
F :  That 's why I 'm saying .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  it 's fine for looking up when T you know when the show 's on TV .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  You go to th

dialogue type : s
F :  but I I I I think it 's really really wrong headed for something that you that has a lot of state ,

dialogue type : s
F :  it 's gonna interact co in a complicated way with the uh understanding parts .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b.x
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  I I totally agree .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^r
F :  Yeah I I agree .

dialogue type : s
F :  There is there 's a logic to dialogue which which is is separable .

dialogue type : %-
F :  I

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's tricky .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I think it will turn out to be the case that uh , this thing we 're talking about , th the extended n uh knowledge modeler will fill in some parameters about what the person wants .

dialogue type : s
F :  One could well imagine that the next thing that 's trying to fill out the detailed uh , route planning , let 's say , will also have questions that it would like to ask the user .

dialogue type : s
F :  You could well imagine you get to a point where it 's got a a choice to make and it just doesn't know something .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so y you would like it t also be able to uh formulate a query .

dialogue type : s
F :  And to run that back through uh . the dialogue manager and to the output module and back around .

dialogue type : s
F :  And a I a a good design would would allow that to happen .

dialogue type : s
F :  If if you know if if you can't make it happen then you you do your best .

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  I totally agree .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  But but what it nee

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  but th what the point is the

dialogue type : s
F :  in that case the dialogue manager is sort of event driven .

dialogue type : s
F :  So the dialogue manager may think it 's in a dialogue state of one sort ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  and this one of these planning modules comes along and says " hey , right now we need to ask a question " .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that forces the dialogue manager to change state .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  It could be y

dialogue type : fg|%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Oh , yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : qw.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  S so uh y we we looked at the e current pattern matching thing .

dialogue type : s
F :  And as you say it 's just a surface pattern matcher .

dialogue type : qw
F :  Uh , So what are what are the plans roughly ?

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Do you have a particular parser in mind ?

dialogue type : qy.%--
F :  Is it uh partic d

dialogue type : qy.%--
F :  I mean have you thought through ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  Is it an HPSG parser ?

dialogue type : qrr^rt
F :  Is it a whatever ?

dialogue type : fg
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
F :  Oh , you have to do it .

dialogue type : s^bk^r
F :  You have to do it ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  I see ,

dialogue type : %-
F :  so

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  But the people at D F

dialogue type : fg
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  People at DFKI have written a fair number of parsers .

dialogue type : s
F :  Other you know , people over the years . uh have written various parsers at DFKI .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  None of them are suitable ?

dialogue type : s^df
F :  I I I d I 'm asking .

dialogue type : s^df^no
F :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  So , um So there was a chunk parser in Verbmobil , that was one of the uh branchers .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  You know they d th I c

dialogue type : s
F :  There were these various uh , competing uh syntax modules .

dialogue type : s
F :  And I know one of them was a chunk parser

dialogue type : s
F :  and I don't remember who did that .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^no
F :  Yeah I d I don't remember .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Uh . I see .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  There w

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s
F :  They w They had There were This was done with a two phase thing , where the chunk parser itself was pretty stupid

dialogue type : s
F :  and then there was a kind of trying to fit them together that h used more context .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^rt.%--
F :  But is that the kind of thing y

dialogue type : s
F :  It sounds like the kind of thing that you were thinking of .

dialogue type : qw^br
F :  What ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Of course .

dialogue type : s^arp
F :  But But uh given th the constraints , that you want it to be small and fast and so forth , my guess is you 're probably into some kind of chunk parsing .

dialogue type : s
F :  And uh I 'm not a big believer in this um statistical you know , cleaning up

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh

dialogue type : s
F :  It That seems to me kind of a last resort if uh you can't do it any other way .

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh

dialogue type : s^no
F :  but I dunno .

dialogue type : s
F :  It may i i may be that 's what you guys finally decide do .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Uh .

dialogue type : qy.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  Fastus ?

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  ah !

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  It is .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  I mean it 's it was pretty ambitious .

dialogue type : s
F :  And of course it was English oriented ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  um w

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , I guess that 's the point is is all the morphology and stuff .

dialogue type : s
F :  And English is all th all word order .

dialogue type : s
F :  And it makes a lot more sense .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And e

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah , OK .

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  Good point .

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  So in in in German you 've got uh most of this done with

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : qw.%--
F :  So what about

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um

dialogue type : qy.%--
F :  Did y

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  like Morfix ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  a a e y you 've got stemmers ?

dialogue type : qrr.%-
F : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
F :  But did you have that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  I see .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  So y you just connect to the lexicon

dialogue type : fh
F :  and uh

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  at least for German you have all all of the uh the stemming information .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  But it it it doesn't look like i you 're using it .

dialogue type : s
F :  I didn't n see it being used in the current template uh parser .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  of course we l actually only looked at the English .

dialogue type : qy^rt^t1
F :  Did we look at the German ?

dialogue type : s^no^t1
F :  I don't remember .

dialogue type : qw.%-
F :  So w wha

dialogue type : %-
F :  i

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  And that 's what you have .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : qw.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s.%-
F :  uh I didn't reme

dialogue type : qw^br
F :  Huh ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh OK ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : qr^d
F :  So in German then you actually do case matching and things like in the in the pattern matcher or not ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Cuz I r I didn't reme I didn't think I saw it .

dialogue type : qw
F :  Have we looked at the German ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  Oh , I haven

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  that 's getting it from the lexicon is just fine .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  No problem with that .

dialogue type : fg
F :  um

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah and here 's the case where the English and the German might really be significantly different .

dialogue type : s
F :  In terms of if you 're trying to build some fast parser and so forth

dialogue type : fh.%
F : 

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  You really might wanna do it in a significantly different way .

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I don't know .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
F :  So you 've you guys have looked at this ?

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
F :  also ?

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  in terms of You know , w if you 're doing this for English as well as German

dialogue type : fh|qy^rt
F :  Um Do you think now that it would be this doing it similarly ?

dialogue type : s^2
F :  Set .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  Interesting .

dialogue type : sj^ba
F :  Not easy .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  Now actually ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  um

dialogue type : qw^rt
F :  Are you guys free at five ?

dialogue type : qrr^rt
F :  Or Do you have to go somewhere at five o ' clock tonight ?

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
F :  W in ten minutes ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Great .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  So you 're going to that .

dialogue type : s
F :  That 's good , because that will uh tell you a fair amount about The form of semantic construction grammar that we 're using .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  so So I th I think that probably as good an introduction as you 'll get .

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh to the form of of uh conceptual grammar that that w we have in mind for this .

dialogue type : s
F :  It won't talk particularly about how that relates to what uh Robert was saying at the beginning .

dialogue type : s
F :  But let me give you a very short version of this .

dialogue type : s
F :  So we talked about the fact that There 're going to be a certain number of decisions That you want the knowledge modeler to make , that will be then fed to the function module , that does uh , route planning .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's called the " route planner " or something .

dialogue type : s
F :  So there are these decisions .

dialogue type : s
F :  And then one half of this we talked about at little bit is how if you had the right information ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  if you knew something about what was said

dialogue type : qo
F :  and about th the something about was the agent a tourist or a native or a business person

dialogue type : s^e
F :  or uh young or old ,

dialogue type : s
F :  whatever .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  That information ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  and also about the

dialogue type : s
F :  Uh , what we 're calling " the entity " ,

dialogue type : qo^e
F :  Is it a castle ,

dialogue type : qo^e
F :  is it a bank ?

dialogue type : qo^e
F :  Is it a s town square ,

dialogue type : qo^e
F :  is it a statue ?

dialogue type : s
F :  Whatever .

dialogue type : s
F :  So all that kind of information could be combined into decision networks and give you decisions .

dialogue type : qo
F :  But the other half of the problem is How would you get that kind of information from the parsed input ?

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So , um

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So what you might try to do is just build more templates , saying uh

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  we 're trying to build a templ

dialogue type : s
F :  you know build a template that w uh somehow would capture the fact that he wants to take a picture .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  OK ?

dialogue type : s
F :  And and we could you could do this .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  You could do this .

dialogue type : s
F :  But uh from our point of view this is also a research project

dialogue type : s
F :  and there are a couple of people not here for various reasons who are doing doctoral dissertations on this ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and the idea that we 're really after is a very deep semantics based on cognitive linguistics

dialogue type : s
F :  and the notion that there are a relatively small number of primitive conceptual schemas that characterize a lot of activity .

dialogue type : s
F :  So a typical one in this formulation is a container .

dialogue type : s
F :  So this is a static thing .

dialogue type : s
F :  And the notion is that all sorts of physical situations are characterized in terms of containers .

dialogue type : s^e.%--
F :  Going in and out the portals and con

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  But also , importantly for Lakoff and these guys is all sorts of metaphorical things are also characterized this way .

dialogue type : s
F :  You get in trouble and you know et cetera

dialogue type : %--
F :  and so s

dialogue type : s
F :  So , what we 're really trying to do is to map from the discourse to the conceptual semantics level .

dialogue type : s
F :  And from there to the appropriate decisions .

dialogue type : s
F :  So another one of these primitive , what are called " image schemas " , is uh goal seeking .

dialogue type : s
F :  So this a notion of a source , path , goal , trajector , possibly obstacles .

dialogue type : s
F :  And the idea is this is another conceptual primitive .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  And that all sorts of things , particularly in the tourist domain , can be represented in terms of uh source , path and goal .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  So the idea would be could we build an analyser that would take an utterance

dialogue type : s:s^fe^rt
F :  and say " Aha !

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  th this utterance is talking about an attempt to reach a goal .

dialogue type : s
F :  The goal is this ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  the pers the , uh traveller is that ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  the sor w where we are at now is is this ,

dialogue type : s
F :  they 've mentioned possible obstacles , et cetera . "

dialogue type : s
F :  So th the and this is an again attempt to get very wide coverage .

dialogue type : s
F :  So if you can do this , then the notion would be that across a very large range of domains , you could use this deep conceptual basis as the interface .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  And then ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  uh

dialogue type : s
F :  The processing of that , both on the input end , recognizing that certain words in a language talk about containers or goals , et cetera ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and on the output end , given this kind of information , you can then uh make decisions about what actions to take .

dialogue type : s
F :  Provides , they claim , a very powerful , general notion of deep semantics .

dialogue type : s
F :  So that 's what we 're really doing .

dialogue type : fh
F :  And

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  Her talk is going to be not about using this in applications , but about modeling how children might learn this kind of uh deep semantic grammar .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well that 's that 's that 's where the belief - net comes in .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So th the idea is ,

dialogue type : s
F :  let 's take this business about going to the Powder - Tower .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  So part of what you 'll get out of this will be the fact tha w

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  if it works right ,

dialogue type : s
F :  OK , that this is an agent that wants to go to this place

dialogue type : s
F :  and that 's their goal

dialogue type : s
F :  and there will be additional situational information .

dialogue type : s^f
F :  Uh , OK ,

dialogue type : s
F :  part of it comes from the ontology .

dialogue type : s
F :  The tower is this kind of object .

dialogue type : s
F :  Part of it comes from the user model .

dialogue type : s
F :  And the idea of the belief - net is it combines the information from the dialogue which comes across in this general way ,

dialogue type : s
F :  you know this is a this is a goal seeking behavior , along with specific information from the ontology about the kinds of objects involved

dialogue type : s:qw
F :  and about the situation about " Is it raining ? "

dialogue type : s^no
F :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
F :  Whatever it is .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so that 's the belief - net that we 've laid out .

dialogue type : s
F :  And so th the coupling to the situation comes in this model from , at th at th at the belief - net , combining evidence from the dialogue with the ontology with the situation .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  But Nancy isn't gonna talk about that ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  just about the um

dialogue type : fh
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  The the construction grammar .

dialogue type : s
F :  In a minute .

dialogue type : b
F :  OK .
