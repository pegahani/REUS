dialogue type : z
E :  Uh .

dialogue type : z

dialogue type : z

dialogue type : z
E :  They don't show up on that thing .

dialogue type : z
E :  Yeah , I 'm sure I 'm sure they 're recorded .

dialogue type : z
E :  They tend to clip .

dialogue type : b
E :  Ahh .

dialogue type : s
E :  So you 've implemented radio buttons .

dialogue type : qw
E :  What happened ?

dialogue type : s^ng.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^t3
E :  Just trying to give you a hard transcription task .

dialogue type : s^ar.%

dialogue type : s^fa^t3
E :  I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : s^ar^t3|s^t3
E :  No , I wish .

dialogue type : s^ar^r^t3
E :  No .

dialogue type : s^ar^t3
E :  No .

dialogue type : s^t3
E :  Just studied phonetics in general .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Yeah , it 's weird .

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  It 's kind of , uh ,

dialogue type : s^t3
E :  apical - alveolar kind of thing .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : s^ar^t3
E :  No .

dialogue type : s^nd^t3
E :  Not too well .

dialogue type : fh

dialogue type : s^t3

dialogue type : s^bk^t3

dialogue type : s^t3.%--

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  I 'm surviving .

dialogue type : %-
E :  Yeah , I uh

dialogue type : s
E :  You guys gave up too soon .

dialogue type : s
E :  I think you just get used to it after five minutes .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mmm .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
E :  You 'd mentioned there was some possibility that somewhere else is going to you might contract out to do the transcription ?

dialogue type : qy.%-
E :  Can y

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah , that 's what I was wondering .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
E :  Well ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  one thing that Horacio h hadn't mentioned is ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , y you were talking about uh the same the same sort of idea of just collecting a meeting and and looking at it afterwards .

dialogue type : s
E :  But the the thing that I 'm interested in , and I 'm probably the one who 's gonna start doing the collection , um , is e is having this situation where people are talking to each other and talking to a computer in the machine in in the room .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  and

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : %--
E :  u

dialogue type : s
E :  that 's certainly what 's gonna come out of , uh , of our group first .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Uh um .

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : h
E :  Well ,

dialogue type : h|s
E :  so , you know , what we 're we 're basically doing is is waiting to look at the pilot and see what people wanna do

dialogue type : s
E :  but it 's going all be Wizard of Oz at first .

dialogue type : s
E :  So we 're gonna let them do what they wanna do first and then see if we should um , you know , subsequent things .

dialogue type : s
E :  Try to try to constrain them

dialogue type : s
E :  or not constrain them .

dialogue type : s
E :  Or try try to figure that out .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
E :  Pardon ?

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
E :  e

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  and it 's all of these things i i is a g

dialogue type : s
E :  It is exactly these things that I mentioned .

dialogue type : s
E :  This is these are the main things that I 'm interested in .

dialogue type : s
E :  Exactly these .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  When when do you know when you 're starting and when you know you 're ending .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  So we wanna we wanna look at exactly those sorts of things .

dialogue type : s
E :  of of us , at least in the beginning , is gonna have a number of different characteristics .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's not going to be natural .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's not gonna be a regular meeting .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's gonna be an artificial situation cuz we 're gonna have to , you know , mock up some back - end .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s
E :  So the kinds of , you know the kinds of speech is the speech is gonna be slightly different .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  People are gonna be in an unnatural task .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fg
E :  But

dialogue type : s
E :  But we will have the , you know We 'll we 'll have all this all the m microphones set up all the same .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  And Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  And if your task is to just sort of , you know , generally do , um , summary and , uh and large vocabulary speech recognition over the thing , then it doesn't matter that much which , uh , that there 's much a difference .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Yeah , actually we could do that at our site too

dialogue type : s^df
E :  even though that 's not what I 'm normally gonna be collecting ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but there 's no reason we can't collect that ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  and , uh , then you 'd have a more m your normal kind of meeting .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  They 're going to be goal directed .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fh|s^na
E :  Yeah , you know . You 're supposed to you 're a budget meeting or something

dialogue type : s^df
E :  and you have a spreadsheet up there ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  and everybody has to sort of work out the you know , some particular goal of where to p allocate money .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  And they can t ask the computer to switch things around in different columns or something like that .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  But everybody s

dialogue type : s^e
E :  and acs actually a o another characteristic is that we 're only dealing with three people .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  We 're gonna start with just three people ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  yeah .

dialogue type : h|s^aap
E :  Um , I think it 's mainly It 's partly channel limitation

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because we wanna we wanna double mike everybody .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
E :  Um , it 's also to a large extent ,

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  And we have eight channels .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's also I think , uh , e e sort of what came up I think when even Liz was , uh , involved a little while ago with and Christine I think just in terms of the thinking of the subjects and trying to have enough people .

dialogue type : s
E :  We sort of wanted to , you know , encourage like everybody to talk ,

dialogue type : s
E :  try to figure out some way that everybody would be able to participate

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : %-
E :  A g

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yes ,

dialogue type : s^na
E :  that was that was the idea .

dialogue type : %--
E :  Uh , but

dialogue type : fh
E :  I don't know ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  that was , you know , w we 're not uh planning to do anything with with all that like right away .

dialogue type : s
E :  So if there were is there you know , we h we 're happy to take input on that .

dialogue type : s
E :  And also , I very much wanna find out about the , you know , the specs on the board that you have in the ma in the i in the PCI card

dialogue type : s^df
E :  cuz I think we might wanna go with that .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No , no ,

dialogue type : s^df^nd
E :  we 're ho we 're hoping to just bring in different groups of three people apiece .

dialogue type : h
E :  Uh .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
E :  In a given in a given meeting ?

dialogue type : s
E :  What we 're try what we 're trying to do is not make it too eh you know , not make it too , um , ar artificial .

dialogue type : fh
E :  You know ,

dialogue type : s^df:s^bk
E :  not like say , " OK ,

dialogue type : s:s^co
E :  mmm , let 's role play .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  Your , y " you know , " you do this , you wanna "

dialogue type : s
E :  but rather give them an actual task .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and they all just have their own they just happen to have their own opinions .

dialogue type : s
E :  And another possible thing that we 're thinking of is something like , uh , you know , we have these regular Wednesday lunches

dialogue type : s|qy^d^g^rt
E :  and you gotta plan a menu , right ?

dialogue type : s^df
E :  So everybody has things that they like

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No .

dialogue type : s^co^j
E :  None of that .

dialogue type : s^co^j
E :  N no eating during meetings .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
E :  Maybe salivating if you 're thinking about the food ,

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
E :  so the idea is we wanna start off with a somewhat simple back - end

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  So basically , what wh people will see a spreadsheet and they can ask it to move numbers around .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So

dialogue type : s^df
E :  we thought that would be a be a useful kind of task for budget meetings or that kind of thing .

dialogue type : fh|s^na
E :  So starting off we would start off definitely with a Wizard of Oz task

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Uh yes ,

dialogue type : s
E :  but it would be something uh but everything would be an agent .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  And so it just be you know , we wouldn't have the recognition grammar to begin with .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  We wouldn't have the NL grammar to begin with .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  But these are all components that are obvious to us how to build .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Nothing nothing that 's sort of far in the future .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  It 's just a matter of of work .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bs
E :  Something that can be built up , you know , relatively quickly

dialogue type : s^bs
E :  and makes sense how to do .

dialogue type : s^bs
E :  So a fairly simple back - end .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 's good .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Great .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Oh , that 's really interesting .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  We 're starting off with digit stuff too for for for our different for for this , um , endpointing stuff .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  We were thinking something like , you know , ten hours to begin with .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  That 's actually , that 's the other thing .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fg
E :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
E :  One thing I should point out , we were n we were not planning on tra doing transcription of the full thing right away ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  u cuz that 's not I mean , I was initially interested in just the speech that was directed at the computer .

dialogue type : fh|s^df
E :  And so we were not planning on doing the transcribing the entire thing .

dialogue type : s
E :  But I mean , that 's something to talk about .

dialogue type : s
E :  If you wanted if you wanted to transcribe , you have the

dialogue type : s
E :  yes , @ @ you 'll be fine .

dialogue type : qw^rt
E :  So what is the company ?

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  I heard a " sh " .

dialogue type : b
E :  Ah !

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  Well , that 's me personally .

dialogue type : s
E :  Our group in general as Horacio was saying is also interested in some of the same general issues .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and I 'm also interested in prosody , um , use you know , u used over person to person stuff

dialogue type : s^e
E :  like segment and helping for segmentation and stuff .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  N the language models c Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bh^rt
E :  Really ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Oh , sure .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  uh we 're we 're gonna be using the same thing that we 've done in the past

dialogue type : s^df
E :  which is , you know , we need a natural language grammar written anyway .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  It 's written in unification grammar framework .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
E :  um , but with context free grammar , power ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  and so it 's just changed directly into something the recognizer recognizes off of directly with with no ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  um ,

dialogue type : s^na
E :  It 's it 's it 's hand - coded .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Because we need we need to write the natural language grammar anyway to understand .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  So it 's it 's a small , you know , ATIS - sized type task .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So ,

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  yeah , that 's that 's the way we 've been approaching it .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  Eh if we if we 're ge

dialogue type : fh
E :  yeah , we you know ,

dialogue type : s
E :  if we 're gonna be able to interpret it then I mean , if we 're not gonna be able to interpret that then it 's not gonna do us much good anyway to recognize it .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs^df
E :  So we might as well go directly from the natural language grammar .

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  It is a unification base ,

dialogue type : s^df^nd
E :  it 's not it 's not as as theoretically bound as HPSG in particular ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  although the couple of people that we have working on it have HPSG backgrounds .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's all up to when I have free time .

dialogue type : qy^j
E :  Anybody else want to work on this by the way , Horacio ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well I know they 're all working on mediated spaces

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  but there 's a lotta aspects o e to that to that project .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yes .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Well , so we haven't even you know , we haven't collected a byte yet

dialogue type : fh
E :  so .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  And we have the same sampling rate .

dialogue type : s
E :  One one thing we do know is that we 're we 're all producing NIST Sphere files in in , uh , eh in the standard format .

dialogue type : s^m^na
E :  Sixteen bit , sixteen kilohertz .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  And the amazing thing is that even even , you know , the entire way through we 're actually using some very , very similar stuff .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  And so tha

dialogue type : fh
E :  yeah .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So ,

dialogue type : s^na.%--
E : 

dialogue type : fh
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  We actually have , yeah , quite similar hardware as it turns out .

dialogue type : s
E :  Which is ver it 's it 's very good ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  I mean , @ @ like I say . I 'm I 'm personally not interested in those for my particular aspect of the project

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^am.%--
E :  And s I don't know , maybe we will end up transcribing stu

dialogue type : s^am
E :  if Hor - if Horacio wants , you know , wants that done , maybe that 'll be maybe we 'll end up doing that .

dialogue type : s^ba.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  All these things were very , very similar .

dialogue type : %
E : 

dialogue type : s^na
E :  We we we were gonna use the same tool .

dialogue type : s
E :  We we set up that tool already ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  that 's right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
E :  I don't think we have any problem .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  I mean , we had certainly in our you know , the proposal that we tried to make to NSF , we were assuming we would distribute this through the LDC .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
E :  so we have no problem with that .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  It 's terrific .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , s it tho those those kinds of things are sorta the kind of things that we were thinking of of trying ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  cuz we are having we do have a more artificial set environment again .

dialogue type : s
E :  We 're trying something totally new

dialogue type : s^df
E :  having people speak to the computer .

dialogue type : s
E :  I don't think we talked about that in particular

dialogue type : s^df
E :  cuz we didn't we haven't done any pilots ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  we haven't seen this , incredibly difficult data of overlapping .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
E :  But this is

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  sh she 's interested in these sorts of things .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  What what can you ask people to do that , um , that they can reliably do and without too much , you know , cognitive load , um , that can help things out ,

dialogue type : s
E :  or , you know , those sorts of issues .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  Maybe it 's something that could fit easier in in our context than in a general meeting context .

dialogue type : fh
E :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
E :  Just have a button .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
E :  And ring the buzzer .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - mmm .

dialogue type : s^no
E :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s
E :  We For a t for a completely different reason I assume

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  And and not within a not within a big room .

dialogue type : %--
E :  Just , uh .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
E :  But you need the room and the set up .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
E :  yeah , we 're not doing digits in the in the room set up at all .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
E :  We 're doing it for a complete

dialogue type : fh
E :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s
E :  one of the specific things I 'm interested in is knowing um , is the open mike issue .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  When you 're talking to the computer , knowing when you 're done speaking .

dialogue type : s
E :  And so I 'm loo interested in in well , in interested in looking at prosody .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and so we 're just having we 're just doing lists of digits to see when people pause to know , you know , " there was a big gap in time here

dialogue type : s
E :  but , they " you know , we can tell prosodically they weren't done ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  so .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  right .

dialogue type : b
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Oh , right ,

dialogue type : s
E :  just look at the very last look at the very end .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df

dialogue type : s^no
E :  I don't know .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Huh .

dialogue type : s^bu
E :  But the projector 's not part of your meeting

dialogue type : qy^g
E :  or or or is it ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  Do is this normally gonna be on during collection ?

dialogue type : s
E :  For ours it will

dialogue type : s
E :  but we have a rear projector ,

dialogue type : s
