dialogue type : z
G :  OK .

dialogue type : z
G :  Yeah , on your upper lip .

dialogue type : z
G :  Yeah , I think we 're supposed to

dialogue type : z
G :  that 's right .

dialogue type : z
G :  I could can this be adjuste like this ?

dialogue type : z
G :  Is that @ @ ? OK ,

dialogue type : z
G :  thank you .

dialogue type : z
G :  Hello .

G : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^j
G :  Yes . Unless we wanna send them a card .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah , that 's true .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
G :  I 'm puzzled by that .

dialogue type : s
G :  I oh oh , I see .

dialogue type : s
G :  Oh there was a glitch somewhere .

dialogue type : s
G :  I forgot about that .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  but I was able to can transcribe

dialogue type : sj^fe.%
G :  Wow .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : %
G :  That 's not good .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  yeah .

dialogue type : %
G :  The the well wait

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  we should say something about the glitch .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  He he can say something about the glitch .

dialogue type : s^df
G : 

dialogue type : s^r
G :  very small .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : %
G :  S

dialogue type : %
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  I agree .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  I agree .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  It it had no effect on my transcription ,

dialogue type : s
G :  you know , I mean I I had no trouble hearing it and and having time bins

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  Oh , interesting .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  That 's amazing .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  That 's amazing .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  Oh that 's I 'm glad .

dialogue type : s^ba^na
G :  That makes a lot of sense ,

dialogue type : b
G :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Very possible .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  Congratulations

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  is really great .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  I need t Hmm . I need to ask one question .

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  Yeah , well , so what I mean is

dialogue type : fh
G :  um

dialogue type : s
G :  the uh the data that you take into SRI , first first question ,

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  you 're maintaining it in in a place that wouldn't be publicly readable that that kind of stuff ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
G :  right ?

dialogue type : s
G :  By uh people uh who are not associated with this project .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Mm - hmm , exactly .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  Great .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  Yeah , we had to get them to approve em

dialogue type : %--
G :  and then i cuz cuz the other question I was gonna ask is if we 're having um you know it 's

dialogue type : s
G :  but this this meeting that you have , no problem

dialogue type : s^df
G :  cuz I I well I mean I I speak for myself

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  but but I think that we didn't do anything that but

dialogue type : fh|sj
G :  well anyway so uh I wouldn't be too concerned about it with respect to that

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  although we should clear it with Eric and Dan of course

dialogue type : s
G :  but these results are based on data which haven't had the uh haven't had the chance to be reviewed by the subjects

dialogue type : s
G :  and I don't know how that stands ,

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean if you if you get fantastic results and it 's involving data which which later end up being lessened by , you know certain elisions , then I don't know

dialogue type : s
G :  but I wanted to raise that issue ,

dialogue type : s^tc
G :  that 's all .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  Great .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Just Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
G :  One one question which is I I had the impression from this from this meeting that w that I transcribed that um that there was already automatic downsampling occurring ,

dialogue type : qy.%--
G :  is that

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  I thought that in order to

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  so it was so it 's like there 's already down

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh OK .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  That 's exactly , and that 's how I know it .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
G :  The cross pads ?

dialogue type : b
G :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  I I thought of some extra a couple of extra things I 'd like to mention .

dialogue type : s
G :  One of them is to give you a status in terms of the transcriptions so far .

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  So um as of last night um I 'd assigned twelve hours and they 'd finished nine

dialogue type : s
G :  and my goal was to have eleven done by the end of the month ,

dialogue type : s
G :  I think that by tomorrow we 'll have ten .

dialogue type : s
G :  So they 're still working .

dialogue type : s|s^ft
G :  It 's working out , thanks .

dialogue type : s^ft
G :  Thanks .

dialogue type : s^cs^t
G :  And then um also an idea for another meeting , which would be to have the transcribers talk about the data

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  It 's sort of a a little bit a little bit

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah , exa exactly

dialogue type : s
G :  I guess nested several layers ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  but

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Well that 's what I 'm thinking ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  Have them talk about the data and they and they 've made observations to me

dialogue type : s
G :  like they say uh you know this meeting that we think has so much overlap , in fact it does

dialogue type : s
G :  but there are other groups of similar size that have very little ,

dialogue type : s
G :  you know it 's part of it 's it 's the norm of the group and all that

dialogue type : s
G :  and they have various observations that would be fun , I think .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  Oh good .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : qw.%-
G :  What what

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  yeah that 's right .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah exactly ,

dialogue type : b
G :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Great .

dialogue type : b
G :  Great .

dialogue type : s^rt^t
G :  And then I wanted to also um say something about the Fiscus uh uh John John Fiscus visit tomorrow .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  And Which is to say that w it 'll be from nine to one

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  that I 'm going to uh uh offer the organization allow him to uh adjust it if he wishes

dialogue type : s
G :  but to be basically in three parts ,

dialogue type : s
G :  the acoustic part coming first which would be basically the room engineering aspects

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  um other things

dialogue type : s
G :  and he 'll be also presenting what NIST is doing

dialogue type : fh
G :  and and uh then uh

dialogue type : s
G :  number two would be sort of a the the transcription process

dialogue type : s
G :  so this would be a focus on like presegmentation and the modifications to the the multitrans interface

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which allows more refined encoding of the beginnings and ends of the overlapping segments

dialogue type : s
G :  which uh Dave Gelbart 's been doing

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  and then um uh and of course the presegmentation Thilo 's been doing

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  and again he has some stuff that 's i relevant with respect to NIST

dialogue type : s
G :  and then the third one would be focus on transcription standards

dialogue type : s
G :  so at NIST he 's interested in this establishment of a global encoding standard I guess I would say

dialogue type : s
G :  and I want it ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  you know k

dialogue type : fh
G :  yeah

dialogue type : s
G :  see what they 're doing and also present what what we 've chosen as ours and and discuss that kind of thing .

dialogue type : s
G :  And so but he 's only here until until one

dialogue type : s
G :  and actually we 're thinking of noon being uh lunch time

dialogue type : s
G :  so basically hoping that we can get as much of this done as possible before noon .

dialogue type : %
G :  S

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  And everybody who wants to attend is welcome .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So

dialogue type : b
G :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  Here mostly

dialogue type : s^e
G :  but I 've also reserved the BARCO room um eh to figure out how that works in terms of like maybe having a live demonstration .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  Oh I think that would be hard , yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ft
G :  Thank you though ,

dialogue type : b.%
G :  uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  When we do this in the key in the key in the key it has to indicate that channel change ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  right ?

dialogue type : s
G :  Well i have a time mark .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
G :  Then you then you go back to Norway ,

dialogue type : %--
G :  that 's

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .
