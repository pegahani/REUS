dialogue type : z
F :  We have littler heads

dialogue type : z
F :  so .

dialogue type : z
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - mmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^m^rt
F :  i " Ish decay " ?

dialogue type : fg|qw
F :  Yeah , what 's an " ish " ?

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  Actually , that comes back to a point .

dialogue type : s^rt:s
F :  We had talked about this last week , where you were interested in " so " .

dialogue type : s
F :  Saying " so " at the end of something .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  And sometimes that would get transcribed as

dialogue type : s
F :  OK , so , let me just think of an example .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  OK , let 's say I say , " Well , that would be hard to do , so . "

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
F :  OK , right ?

dialogue type : s:s
F :  And the way I would transcribe it , I would put that " so that would be hard " , comma , " so "

dialogue type : s^e
F :  at the end .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : fh
F :  " So . "

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yeah , I would just sort of end it .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  But then sometimes they transcribe it like " So that would be a problem " , period , new word , like capitalized " So " .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  Right . And and it just seems to sotal totally that that 's not the meaning .

dialogue type : s
F :  And and it changes the meaning , I think .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^aap|s^aa
F :  Or whatever , yeah ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  " that would be a problem " ,

dialogue type : s
F :  whatever .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
F :  " So . "

dialogue type : s:s
F :  It seems like because if I was just reading that thing , I would say , " So that would be a problem . So . "

dialogue type : qy^d^f
F :  You know what I mean ?

dialogue type : s:s
F :  Th - if if it was like , " period , capital SO " , as opposed to , um , " That would be a problem , so . "

dialogue type : s:s
F :  " That would be a problem . So . "

dialogue type : %-
F :  Some

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right , yeah .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s:s
F :  Yeah . I just wonder , like , what influences them to think of " twosome gruesome " ,

dialogue type : s^am^rt
F :  like maybe this person just saw a horror movie or something ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  And ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  uh , this is the interpretation that came to mind or something ?

dialogue type : qy^f^rt
F :  You know what I mean ?

dialogue type : qw:s
F :  Like , where would you get the word " gruesome " ?

dialogue type : s
F :  You know , you just sort of pull it out of the air ?

dialogue type : s^bd^tc
F :  Anyway .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  OK .

dialogue type : x
F :  Mmm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Right .

dialogue type : x
F :  " Pss " .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  But this other business , um , that you have at the bottom with people getting transcribed on another channel

dialogue type : s
F :  is , uh is much more common .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s
F :  And what 's always funny to me is when it 's th you know , they m mi miss the gender completely ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  like , you know , Morgan 'll be on Jane 's channel ,

dialogue type : s
F :  or just something bizarre like that .

dialogue type : fh
F :  Um , so .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Fancy - schmancy .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  If I was gonna make just a guess , though , from my experience it would seem like the men get mis um ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  the men get moved onto other channels , maybe more frequently .

dialogue type : s
F :  And it 's just probably cuz they have deeper voices

dialogue type : s
F :  and they 're getting picked up on more channels , um , than their own channel .

dialogue type : s
F :  Um , for w you know , it 's an acoustic thing .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%
F :  Yeah , you could see it coming and you 'd turn the volume down or something .

dialogue type : s
F :  But sometimes you 'll see like something coming up

dialogue type : s:s^fe
F :  like , " Uh - oh .

dialogue type : s
F :  Someone 's gonna cough really loudly " ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and I could tell because of the way it looks !

dialogue type : s
F :  Or " someone 's about to laugh really loudly " ,

dialogue type : fh|s^aa
F :  um yeah ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  and then you 're just sort you 've got like you know you 're sort of like

dialogue type : fh
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  So unless there 's gonna be some speech in there , I don't think I need to listen that carefully .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s|s^bk
F :  You could h really hurt your ears . Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Gives some good clues ,

dialogue type : b
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Oh yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  Sometimes it doesn't pick up backchannelling , though ,

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  there 's no visual

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  Yeah , you have to the resolution ,

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
F :  Just to jump it back .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Right , cuz sometimes you 'll hear It 'll be in right in the middle of the timebin ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and you don't have to listen to the whole thing again

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz you 've already gotten the first part .

dialogue type : s^bu.%--
F :  So you just want it to go back ,

dialogue type : s^no
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  That 's true .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm . Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , the less you have to click on the mouse , I think the faster you could go .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
F :  Yeah , you were having some wrist problems and stuff ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba^fe
F :  Yeah . Ooh !

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  or vice versa

dialogue type : s
F :  it 's just , uh it 's like I 'll I 'll reach for one key and it 'll do something completely different ,

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Yeah , the backspace is in the wrong place .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Oh yeah , and then I 'll keep I keep caps - locking too

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz the caps - lock 's in a different spot .

dialogue type : fh

dialogue type : s^cs
F :  so . We maybe we should trade .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s^na|s^aa

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  I just have no preference .

dialogue type : b.%
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  It just goofs me up for like maybe a minute

dialogue type : s
F :  and then I sorta get used to it .

dialogue type : b
F :  Huh .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^na

dialogue type : s^bd^e
F :  Just a little bit .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|qw
F :  Yeah , what happened to that ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt

dialogue type : qrr.%-

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  Good .

dialogue type : b^rt
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah the hardest thing 'd be finding them .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Cuz I would get the whole tr I 'd get the whole transcript of the meeting

dialogue type : s^df^e
F :  and you had to find them .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  You 'd have to find where the digits were .

dialogue type : s
F :  And they 'd usually be at the end somewhere ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  but you had to fig figure out where the heck in the meeting to to look for them ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yeah !

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , the interface was different .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  I I yeah ,

dialogue type : s
F :  it was it was more complicated .

dialogue type : s^bd
F :  But anyway ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  than what it would be now ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  so .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Right . That 's when I use it too .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  If there was pie again ,

dialogue type : s:s
F :  if there was those tarts again , I 'd be like , " Set us some aside some there . "

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  I 'm not a big ice cream fan .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Nah .

dialogue type : s
F :  When people get really loopy ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and start telling lots of jokes , I think .

dialogue type : s
F :  I enjoy always transcribing those sections .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  It 's yeah , it seems to be more at the end .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^na
F :  Yeah , they 'll be joking around .

dialogue type : qw^br
F :  Wait , a favorite what ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu.%--
F :  Oh , you mean like , eh , meeti like like , um , Meeting Recorder as opposed to EDU as oppo

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  Like , those groups ?

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
F :  I 've never heard anyone make fun of transcribers .

dialogue type : s^ar^fe
F :  No !

dialogue type : s:s
F :  When you guys were saying that last week , I was like " Never heard that . "

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
F :  I did that .

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  And whistles .

dialogue type : s
F :  He was it I you must have been sittin There was a meeting where there was this guy ,

dialogue type : s
F :  he was making these funky sounds

dialogue type : s
F :  and making funny whistles ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and you must have been sitting next to him

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz you sort of engaged him in a conversation about it .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  And he was like , " Yeah , I can make dogs , uh , raise their ears

dialogue type : s:s^df
F :  cuz I can whistle so high . "

dialogue type : s:s
F :  And you were like , w " That 's fascinating . "

dialogue type : s
F :  I remember that meeting .

dialogue type : s
F :  I thought it was pretty funny .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^bk

F :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^ar
F :  No .

dialogue type : s^bk.%
F :  Sure .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  like , I had kind of a weird thing happen ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and we 'd talked about it .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  this was before we had the different channels ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and , um , Dan Ellis it was when Dan Ellis was still here

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
F :  so it was like kind of early on , right ?

dialogue type : fh
F :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  he everyone 's talking ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and then all of the sudden , you hear Dan talking to someone else

dialogue type : s
F :  and it 's different people that you 'd never heard before .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  And and what he had done , is he had left the room to g

dialogue type : s
F :  He 'd li and he had brought the microphone with him .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  And this is without the channelized interface .

dialogue type : s
F :  So you you have no idea .

dialogue type : s
F :  You think everyone 's just become schizophrenic or something .

dialogue type : s
F :  And they 're all like in they 're own r world or something

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because Then all of the sudden he 's talking about a co he needs a copy machine .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  And I don and I 'm just assuming , well he 's s s still in the room

dialogue type : s:qw
F :  and what the heck 's he talking about ?

dialogue type : s
F :  But just sort of just weird things like that ,

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  and , um Yeah , he had just left the room

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and gone and made a copy

dialogue type : s
F :  and he still had his microphone on ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and then you could hear the the the r the women behind the desk talking to him ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and just sort of stuff like that .

dialogue type : s^ba
F :  It was just really bizarre .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  Anyway . Just sort of weird things like that .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  So .

dialogue type : s
F :  They take longer to do .

dialogue type : s
F :  In a way they 're more fun , though .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  There 's just more variety .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  Who won't talk .

dialogue type : s^2
F :  And to breathe .

dialogue type : s|s^bk
F :  There 'll be lots of breathing . Yeah .

dialogue type : qy.%--
F :  Did you guys ever ,

dialogue type : s
F :  when This happened to me when I first started transcribing ,

dialogue type : s^df^rt
F :  cuz I had never really transcribed stuff like this before ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but , um ,

dialogue type : s
F :  I would leave here ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and I would go out and do my daily business ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and I would hear people speaking to me ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and I would transcribe them in my head !

dialogue type : s^e^rt
F :  I 'd imagine what I would type .

dialogue type : s
F :  It went away , like maybe after a couple of weeks ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but it was just bizarre .

dialogue type : qy^bh
F :  Really ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
F :  Oh . No , for me it was unconscious .

dialogue type : s
F :  It was I didn't mean for to be doing it .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  It would just intru it was an intrusion .

dialogue type : s^e
F :  Um , not a te not a bad intrusion ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but

dialogue type : s^e.%-

dialogue type : s^aa^fe

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm . Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Right . Yeah well , yeah , most of the time when we 're listening to other people 's speech , we 're just trying to get the gist .

dialogue type : s
F :  Not literally what people are saying

dialogue type : fh
F :  and so ,

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  you know , all the " uh " " uh 's " and " um 's " , and all those different things ,

dialogue type : s
F :  we just tune it out ,

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
F :  And , uh , it 's that top - down thing again .

dialogue type : %--
F : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^g^rt
F :  right ?

dialogue type : s
F :  In a way .

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  Just trying to get the , um ,

dialogue type : s^e:qw
F :  you know , what is the p " what is the point of what this person is trying to communicate ? " kind of thing .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
F :  No .

dialogue type : s
F :  I 've heard

dialogue type : s
F :  Which I just transcribe as " mouth " .

dialogue type : s
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F :  Cuz I think I had talked to you about this about

dialogue type : qw.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  " Lipsmack " !

dialogue type : s
F :  I was marking " lipsmack " ,

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  yeah , that 's It 's a different noise ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but , um ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  it 's what made me think of it ,

dialogue type : fh
F :  but , um ,

dialogue type : s:s^co
F :  and and you said , " Don't do " lipsmack " ,

dialogue type : s:s^df
F :  just do we don't need it 's too specific .

dialogue type : s:s^co
F :  Just do " mouth " for all tha all those noises " .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Oh , right .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : b
F :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
F :  If it 's surprise then the exclamation point makes sense , too .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
F :  Yeah , once , Adam was laughing ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and it was actually written out phonetically ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and I changed it .

dialogue type : s^df:s
F :  I 'm like " it 's just laughing " .

dialogue type : s:s
F :  Like somebody had written , like " hyuh - hyuh " or or or something .

dialogue type : fh
F : 

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
F :  Yeah , i I it was maybe Tigerfish had done something

dialogue type : s^e
F :  like they had written out a phonetic laugh ,

dialogue type : s^e
F :  and they didn't do it at any other place in the transcript .

dialogue type : s
F :  It was just that one spot .

dialogue type : s|s^f
F :  It was just a regular old vanilla laugh , you know .

dialogue type : s
F :  It wasn't anything special .

dialogue type : %-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  well , here 's a question ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and there 's been some variance in transcripts that I 've looked at .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : fh
F :  OK .

dialogue type : s
F :  So when you laugh , you 're exhaling all this air ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and so you need to i inhale ,

dialogue type : qh
F :  and so how do you transcribe the inhale ?

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  Some people are transcribing it as a breath .

dialogue type : s
F :  I I used to , you know , back in the day back when I was do transcribing , I would do the whole thing as a laugh

dialogue type : s^df
F :  because to me the breath is part of the laugh .

dialogue type : fh|s:s
F :  Um , so cuz i cuz in the ones I 've been che the one I 've been checking actually right now , that breath gets marked as a breath ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and I 've been taking them out .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
F :  So that 's OK ?

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  Actually , it 'd be a " laugh "

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  and then two dots ,

dialogue type : s^rt
F :  like the next bin will be empty ,

dialogue type : s
F :  and then it 'll be " breath " .

dialogue type : s.%-
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  it 'll be three d sort of separate units as opposed to I think it 's sort of one coherent thing .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^df^nd
F :  Oh , well , yeah , that 's that 's a different thing .

dialogue type : fh|s^df
F :  Yeah . S cuz sometimes it 's not clear .

dialogue type : s^df:s
F :  Like sometimes " Hhh ! " is a laugh .

dialogue type : fh|s
F :  Um , and if other people are laughing , then I 'll usually give them and say that they 're laughing .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Mm - hmm . Exactly .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : b
F :  Right .

dialogue type : s^ba|s^bk
F :  Good . OK .

dialogue type : b
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s^df
F :  cuz they don't have the the rich interface that we do ,

dialogue type : s^df
F :  so the they must be giving the pre - segmenter sort of the benefit of the doubt ,

dialogue type : s
F :  " Well , there must be something there , um , whether I can hear it or not . "

dialogue type : s
F :  So , they just say , " Well , it 's a breath then " .

dialogue type : s^aa^fe
F :  Yes !

dialogue type : s^na
F :  That 's true .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  Well , frequently that 'll also be a misattribution too , of voice .

dialogue type : s^df
F :  Cuz then you 'll hear you 'll hear part of what another person is saying and th tha and that 's all transcribed on that one level ,

dialogue type : s
F :  but then you 'll hear a little bit of it and then " missing segment " .

dialogue type : s.%--
F : 

dialogue type : s
F :  That person 's not talking at all " .

dialogue type : s
F :  So , you just get rid of it .

dialogue type : fh
F :  So .

dialogue type : b
F :  Hmm !

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
F :  Oh , yeah . That 's true .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^rt
F :  Oh yeah , that 's totally not true .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
F :  It 's rare .

dialogue type : s^aa
F :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
F :  I was wondering who had been putting those in .

dialogue type : s^bk
F :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
F :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba.%
F :  Man !
