dialogue type : z
A :  Am I on ?

dialogue type : z
A :  I guess so .

dialogue type : z
A :  Radio two .

dialogue type : z
A :  Hmm .

dialogue type : z
A :  Radio two .

dialogue type : z
A :  Wow .

dialogue type : z
A :  People say the strangest things when their microphones are on .

dialogue type : fg|qy^d^rt^t
A :  So everybody everybody 's on ?

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt^t
A :  So y you guys had a a meeting with uh with Hynek which I unfortunately had to miss .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um

dialogue type : fh|%--
A :  and uh somebody

dialogue type : fh
A :  eh e and uh

dialogue type : s
A :  I guess Chuck you weren't there either ,

dialogue type : %-
A :  so the uh

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh you were there ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So everybody knows what happened except me .

dialogue type : s^co
A :  OK . Maybe somebody should tell me .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  What was the w what was the downsampling problem again ?

dialogue type : s
A :  I forget .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s|s^aa
A :  Depends what it 's frequency characteristic is , yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  So you could do a you could do a stricter one .

dialogue type : s^am
A :  Maybe .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Was there any conclusion about that ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bs
A :  So again this is th this is the downsampling uh of the uh the feature vector stream

dialogue type : fh
A :  and

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A :  um Yeah I guess the the uh LDA filters they were doing do have

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um uh let 's see , so the the the feature vectors are calculated every ten milliseconds

dialogue type : fh
A :  so

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  uh the question is how far down they are at fifty fifty hertz .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh . Um .

dialogue type : s^bsc
A :  Sorry at twenty - five hertz since they 're downsampling by two .

dialogue type : fh|qy^rt
A :  So . Does anybody know what the frequency characteristic is ?

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Oh OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b^rt
A :  Hmm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : qw^bu^d^rt
A :  Try try what ?

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s^t
A :  I mean I g I guess the key thing for me is is figuring out how to better coordinate between the two sides

dialogue type : %--
A :  cuz because um

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  uh I was talking with Hynek about it later

dialogue type : s
A :  and the the sort of had the sense sort of that that neither group of people wanted to to bother the other group too much .

dialogue type : s.x
A :  And and I don't think anybody is , you know , closed in in their thinking or are unwilling to talk about things

dialogue type : s.x
A :  but I think that you were sort of waiting for them to tell you that they had something for you

dialogue type : s.x
A :  and and that and expected that they would do certain things

dialogue type : s
A :  and they were sor they didn't wanna bother you

dialogue type : s
A :  and they were sort of waiting for you

dialogue type : s
A :  and and and uh we ended up with this thing where they they were filling up all

dialogue type : s
A :  and they just had hadn't thought of that .

dialogue type : fh.x
A :  So .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Uh . I mean it 's true that maybe maybe no one really thought about that that this latency thing would be such a a strict issue

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  Then they couldn't .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : s^2^co
A :  Just talk more .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b^rt
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A :  Well maybe we should just

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  uh I mean you 're you 're bus other than that you folks are busy doing all the all the things that you 're trying that we talked about before

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s
A :  And this machines are busy

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  and you 're busy

dialogue type : fh
A :  and

dialogue type : b^rt
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
A :  Let 's let 's , I mean , I think that as as we said before that one of the things that we 're imagining is that uh there there will be uh in the system we end up with there 'll be something to explicitly uh uh do something about noise

dialogue type : s
A :  in addition to the uh other things that we 're talking about

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  and that 's probably the best thing to do .

dialogue type : s
A :  And there was that one email that said that it sounded like uh uh things looked very promising up there

dialogue type : s.x
A :  in terms of uh I think they were using Ericsson 's approach or something

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  They 're doing some noise removal thing ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b^rt
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah , sure .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt.x
A :  When you say you don't have a result yet you mean it 's it 's just that it 's in process

dialogue type : qrr.x
A :  or that you it finished and it didn't get a good result ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|s^co^t^tc
A :  So um I suggest actually now we we we sorta move on and and hear what 's what 's what 's happening in in other areas

dialogue type : s^e^t
A :  like what 's what 's happening with your investigations about echos and so on .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah I haven't read it in a while so I 'm not gonna be too much help unless I read it again ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : s^tc
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^bu
A :  so you , and then you 're also gonna be doing this echo cancelling between the the close mounted and the and the the the what we 're calling a cheating experiment uh of sorts

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Ah !

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fh
A :  F um

dialogue type : s
A :  Delegate .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  That 's good .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  It 's good to delegate .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Great .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Great .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  Yeah actually um he should uh

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I wonder who else is

dialogue type : s
A :  I think maybe it 's Dan Ellis is going to be doing uh a different cancellation .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um . One of the things that people working in the meeting task wanna get at is they would like to have cleaner close - miked recordings .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  So uh this is especially true for the lapel

dialogue type : s
A :  but even for the close close - miked uh cases

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  So what they 're talking about doing is using ec uh echo cancellation - like techniques .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  It 's not really echo but uh just um uh

dialogue type : s
A :  taking the input from other mikes and using uh uh a uh an adaptive filtering approach to remove the effect of that uh other speech .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : fh|qw
A :  Um what was it ,

dialogue type : s
A :  there was there was some some some point where eh uh Eric or somebody was was speaking and he had lots of silence in his channel

dialogue type : s
A :  and I was saying something to somebody else uh which was in the background

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  it was recognizing my words , which were the background speech on the close close mike .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yes .

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  it was you I was

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So they would like clean channels .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Uh and for that mmm uh that purpose uh they 'd like to pull it out .

dialogue type : s.x
A :  So I think I think Dan Ellis or somebody who was working with him was going to uh work on that .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^tc
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh|s^no^t
A :  Um . And uh I don't know if we 've talked lately about the the plans you 're developing that we talked about this morning

dialogue type : fh|s^no^t
A :  uh I don't remember if we talked about that last week or not ,

dialogue type : s^t
A :  but maybe just a quick reprise of of what we were saying this morning .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Uh .

dialogue type : s
A :  But that 's uh uh all that 's is a a certainly relevant uh study

dialogue type : qw
A :  and , you know , what are the features that they 're finding .

dialogue type : s
A :  We have this problem with the overloading of the term " feature "

dialogue type : fh
A :  so

dialogue type : fh|qw
A :  uh what are the variables ,

dialogue type : qw
A :  what we 're calling this one ,

dialogue type : qw
A :  what are the variables that they 're found finding useful

dialogue type : fh
A :  um

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : fg
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  And that 's certainly one thing to do and we 're gonna try and do something more f more fine than that

dialogue type : fh
A :  but uh

dialogue type : fh
A :  um

dialogue type : fh
A :  so

dialogue type : fh
A :  um

dialogue type : s
A :  So I guess you know what , I was trying to remember some of the things we were saying ,

dialogue type : qy.%--
A :  do you ha still have that ?

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  There 's those that

dialogue type : fh
A :  uh

dialogue type : s.x
A :  yeah , some of some of the issues we were talking about was in j just getting a good handle on on uh what " good features " are

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  And the other thing you were talking about is is is where we get the targets from .

dialogue type : s
A :  So I mean , there 's these issues of what are the what are the variables that you use

dialogue type : s
A :  and do you combine them using the soft " AND - OR " or you do something , you know , more complicated

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  um and then the other thing was so where do you get the targets from ?

dialogue type : s
A :  The initial thing is just the obvious that we 're discussing is starting up with phone labels from somewhere and then uh doing the transformation .

dialogue type : s
A :  But then the other thing is to do something better

dialogue type : qh^cs^rt
A :  and eh w why don't you tell us again about this this database ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : qh^cs^j^rt
A :  And then tell them to talk naturally ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
A :  Maybe you could go to these parlors and and you could , you know you know have have , you know , reduced rates if you if you can do the measurements .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j^na
A :  Yeah , be cool and help science .

dialogue type : fg
A :  OK .

dialogue type : qy.%-
A :  Do you mean eh but you I mean Mar

dialogue type : qy.%-
A :  you mean when was was Mark Randolph there , or ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah he 's he 's he 's at Motorola now .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So the only the only uh hesitation I had about it since , I mean I haven't see the data is it sounds like it 's it 's continuous variables and a bunch of them .

dialogue type : fh
A :  And so

dialogue type : s
A : 

dialogue type : s.x
A :  What you really want are these binary labels , and just a few of them .

dialogue type : s.x
A :  And maybe there 's a trivial mapping if you wanna do it

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  I I I worry a little bit that this is a research project in itself ,

dialogue type : s
A :  whereas um if you did something instead that like um having some manual annotation by uh you know , linguistics students ,

dialogue type : s
A :  this would there 'd be a limited s set of things that you could do a as per our discussions with with John before

dialogue type : s
A :  but the things that you could do , like nasality and voicing and a couple other things you probably could do reasonably well .

dialogue type : s
A :  And then there would it would really be uh this uh uh binary variable .

dialogue type : s
A :  Course then , that 's the other question is do you want binary variables .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  I mean the other thing you could do is boot trying to to uh get those binary variables

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  and take the continuous variables from uh the uh uh the data itself there ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Guess you could , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So anyway that 's that 's uh that 's another whole direction that cou could be looked at .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  Um . Um . I mean in general it 's gonna be for new data that you look at ,

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um . So .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  So wh yeah , where this fits into the rest in in my mind , I guess , is that um we 're looking at different ways that we can combine uh different kinds of of rep front - end representations um in order to get robustness under difficult or even , you know , typical conditions .

dialogue type : s
A :  And part of it , this robustness , seems to come from uh multi - stream or multi - band sorts of things

dialogue type : s
A :  and Saul seems to have a reasonable way of looking at it , at least for one one um articulatory feature .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  the decision about how strongly to train the different pieces is based on uh a a reasonable criterion with hidden variables

dialogue type : s
A :  rather than um just assuming that you should train e e every detector uh with equal strength towards uh it being this phone or that phone .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
A :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A :  So it so um he 's got these um uh uh

dialogue type : s
A :  he " AND 's " between these different features .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's a soft " AND " , I guess

dialogue type : s
A :  but in in principle you you wanna get a strong concurrence of all the different things that indicate something

dialogue type : s
A :  and then he " OR 's " across the different soft " OR 's " across the different uh multi - band channels .

dialogue type : fh|%--
A :  And um the weight

dialogue type : s
A :  yeah , the target for the training of the " AND " " AND ' ed " things is something that 's kept uh as a hidden variable ,

dialogue type : s
A :  and is learned with EM .

dialogue type : s
A :  Whereas what we were doing is is uh taking the phone target and then just back propagating from that

dialogue type : s
A :  which means that it 's it 's uh i It could be for instance that for a particular point in the data you don't want to um uh train a particular band train the detectors for a particular band .

dialogue type : s
A :  You you wanna ignore that band , cuz that 's a Ban - band is a noisy noisy measure .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s^cc
A :  We 're we 're still gonna try to train it up .

dialogue type : s
A :  In our scheme we 're gonna try to train it up to do as well well as it can at predicting .

dialogue type : fh|s^no
A :  Uh . Maybe that 's not the right thing to do .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well at the at the tail end , yeah , he has to know what 's where it 's sonorant .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  But he 's but what he 's - but what he 's not training up uh what he doesn't depend on as truth is

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
A :  um I guess one way of describing would be

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  if if a sound is sonorant is it sonorant in this band ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
A :  Is it sonorant in that band ?

dialogue type : qy^2^rt
A :  Is it sonorant in that band ?

dialogue type : s.x
A :  i It 's hard to even answer that

dialogue type : s
A :  what you really mean is that the whole sound is sonorant .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So

dialogue type : s
A :  then it comes down to , you know , to what extent should you make use of information from particular band towards making your decision .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  And um uh we 're making in a sense sort of this hard decision that you should you should use everything uh with with uh equal strength .

dialogue type : fh|s
A :  And uh because in the ideal case we would be going for posterior probabilities ,

dialogue type : s^e
A :  if we had uh enough data to really get posterior probabilities

dialogue type : s^e
A :  and if the if we also had enough data so that it was representative of the test data

dialogue type : s^e
A :  then we would in fact be doing the right thing to train everything as hard as we can .

dialogue type : s
A :  But um this is something that 's more built up along an idea of robustness from from the beginning

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.x
A :  I mean we ha we have a kind of iterative training because we do this embedded Viterbi ,

dialogue type : fh|s.x
A :  uh so there is some something that 's suggested , based on the data

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s.x
A : 

dialogue type : s.x
A :  cuz then whatever that alignment is , it 's that for all all bands .

dialogue type : s
A :  Well no , that 's not quite right , we did actually do them separate tried to do them separately

dialogue type : s
A :  so that would be a little more like what he did .

dialogue type : fh
A :  Um .

dialogue type : s.x
A :  But it 's still not quite the same because then it 's it 's um setting targets based on where you would say the sound begins in a particular band .

dialogue type : s
A :  Where he 's s this is not a labeling per se .

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Might be closer I guess if we did a soft soft target uh uh embedded neural net training like we 've done a few times

dialogue type : fh|s.x
A :  uh f the forward um do the forward calculations to get the gammas and train on those .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mmm .

dialogue type : fh|qw^t^tc
A :  Uh what 's next ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Oh .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt.x
A :  You 're playing ?

dialogue type : qy^d^r^rt.x
A :  You 're playing ?

dialogue type : qw
A :  What which test set was this ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b^rt
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
A :  Yeah , I mean , it 's not at all uncommon you do worse on long word on short words than long words anyway just because you 're accumulating more evidence for the for the longer word ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  but .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^fe
A :  Wow .

dialogue type : s.x
A :  Lots of silence .

dialogue type : qy^rt.x
A :  Are the SP 's optional ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt.x
A :  I mean skip them ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  I see .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.x
A :  Yeah , I mean , I think that uh , as much as you can , it 's good to d sort of not do anything really tricky .

dialogue type : s.x
A :  Not do anything that 's really finely tuned ,

dialogue type : %--
A :  but just sort of eh you know you t you i z

dialogue type : s.x
A :  The premise is kind of you have a a good person look at this for a few weeks and what do you come up with ?

dialogue type : %-
A :  And uh

dialogue type : s^am
A :  Could be .

dialogue type : fg
A :  Right .

dialogue type : s
A :  And that , I mean , at the moment that 's not the limitation ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : s.%--
A :  I mean , I I I what I thought you were gonna say i but which I was thinking was um

dialogue type : qw
A :  where did six come from ?

dialogue type : s^cs
A :  Probably came from the same place eighteen came from .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
A :  You know ,

dialogue type : fh
A :  so .

dialogue type : h|s
A :  Uh that 's another parameter ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
A :  right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Right .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  But I think right now again the idea is doing just very simple things

dialogue type : qw
A :  how much better can you make it ?

dialogue type : b|s
A :  And um since they 're only simple things there 's nothing that you 're gonna do that is going to blow up the amount of computation

dialogue type : fh
A :  um so

dialogue type : s
A :  if you found that nine was better than six that would be O K , I think , actually .

dialogue type : s
A :  Doesn't have to go down .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Mm - hmm , OK .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  Yeah , just work with the models ,

dialogue type : b
A :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
A :  Cool .

dialogue type : s^tc
A :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|qw.%--
A :  So uh what 's uh

dialogue type : s^t.%--
A :  I guess your plan for You you you guys ' plan for the next next week is just continue on these these same things we 've been talking about for Aurora and

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
A :  Yeah we we have a big list .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  You have a big list of of things to do .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : s^ba^tc
A :  Well that 's good .

dialogue type : s.%--
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  some point a little later next year there will be some sort of standard and it 'll get out there

dialogue type : s
A :  and hopefully it 'll have some effect from something that that has uh been done by our group of people

dialogue type : fh
A :  but uh

dialogue type : s^df
A :  e even if it doesn't there 's there 's go there 'll be standards after that .

dialogue type : fh
A :  So .

dialogue type : b
A :  Huh .

dialogue type : s
A :  OK , guess we 're done .
