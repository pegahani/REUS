dialogue type : s^rt^t
C :  OK . So the one one thing I knew I wanted to talk about was about , uh , sort of last minute stuff to to , uh , try to get some recognition results .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  So , uh , on on on meeting data .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so , I 'm I 'm not sure exactly what you 're doing already ,

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s
C :  Right . So so , we have some stuff with no overlap , uh , for which there would be near near - field results .

dialogue type : s
C :  We wanted to get the far - field results for that .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then this this real , uh , long shot thing would be , that we 'd apply Dave 's processing to , uh , potentially training and test data

dialogue type : s
C :  and do the look at the same thing .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  We couldn't remember how different the numbers were ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  uh , I think Chuck 's recollection was that when he was doing the feature stuff , it took maybe a day and a half

dialogue type : s^e
C :  to do the training .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|qw
C :  Um , how much worse is the short training set than the large one , in terms of the ultimate performance ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , it 's that should be fine for this , I would think .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  So we an and you have the short you have short training results for the close case ?

dialogue type : qw.%--
C :  So , how do you know it 's ?

dialogue type : s
C :  Oh , it 's three percent on on , uh , on Hub - five .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah . But we have the models so we could get that number ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : qw.%-
C :  So the question is , what ? w

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , it 's the non - overlap only .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  it has to be enough to be sort of comparable to what you folks were seeing and what you reported already .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^ar|s
C :  No . He has to create that .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  We have a whole parallel set of things over here which are all with digits .

dialogue type : s
C :  And and and Dave has been working with that and there 's all of those issues .

dialogue type : s
C :  But I know that if I go in with something that 's not just digits it would be good .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , on uh , a l a lot tha tha a particular test set , that you that we reported at HLT .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Um , it 'd be nice to have something more than that .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um , and then ,

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , so this is gonna be a lot worse .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Whatever comparison we w w one would presume .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  But we don't know how much worse ,

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  w w uh , which is certainly one interesting thing .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And then , um ,

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  I think we figured that it 'd probably take a day or two to compute the the ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh|qw.%-
C :  Well How many hours of training ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap|s^ng
C :  Yeah , but we also have to do this other processing , so having a smaller training set ,

dialogue type : s
C :  if it 's only a few percent difference , it might be be worth doing it .

dialogue type : qw
C :  But - m How big is the small training set ?

dialogue type : qy
C :  Do you remember ?

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's around there .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  And ha and and male is roughly half of that ,

dialogue type : qrr^g.%--
C :  or ?

dialogue type : qrr
C :  Or or or was that only

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Yeah . So that 's certainly part of the issue , is that right now he 's he hasn't written his stuff for efficiency .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Yeah . It 's it 's in Matlab

dialogue type : s
C :  and so on ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and And , uh , it 's not an impossible amount of time .

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  We we were guestimating it was like one and a half times faster than real time , or something ?

dialogue type : s
C :  So , if there 's thirty hours of data , you can calculate that he can do , uh , the enhancement in a day

dialogue type : s
C :  and something .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  But if we were dealing with two hundred hours or something , I think it 'd be prohibitive .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah . So , I mean , it 's a bit of a push ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  but it seems like ,

dialogue type : s
C :  OK , we 've got some models ,

dialogue type : s
C :  we 've got some training data , we have software that works , he 's got a method that helps with , you know , other ta another task .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  It , you know , appears to be , you know , debugged .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
C :  Oh . Well , that 's not bad .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  You mean the training .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap
C :  For the test .

dialogue type : s^aa.%-
C :  Yeah , fo

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
C :  I mean , it it 'd be really great if it was all automatic , but I think that , you know , given the pressure of time , if i i

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , since you 're gonna find out in a short amount of time , that 's great .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  But i if if it doesn't work out , I think we would rather charge ahead with the older segmentations

dialogue type : fh
C :  and Um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and we were gonna use one of the P Z

dialogue type : s^no.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Probably whatever one you 've been using for for for the digits .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Is it this one ?

dialogue type : s.%-
C :  I I 'd which ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  That 's F ?

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  How do you know ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^ft.%--
C :  Bien sur

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Bet they 'll have fun with that one .

dialogue type : fh
C :  OK , so .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : h|s^am
C :  Well Maybe .

dialogue type : qw
C :  But , I I mean , how long does it take for the test ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : qw
C :  Bu - But what what was your result for uh , that we had at the HLT ?

dialogue type : qy^e^rt
C :  Was that a combination of me ?

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah . But if you So , if you do half a dozen meetings , that 's that 's about a day .

dialogue type : s
C :  We also have more machines now .

dialogue type : %--
C :  well

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba^bu
C :  I mean , if we had about six A six hour test set 's not bad .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  You know ?

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^m^rt
C :  Four that you worked with ?

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  That would be OK , too .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  I mean , I 'm i

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  So , if they have a set that they worked with ,

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Did you do similarly in performance between them and the other meetings ,

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  or was it ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
C :  And overlap or not .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
C :  So maybe just with the the the Meeting Recorder set of the De - th that you did before .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^cs^na
C :  Yeah . So we want to do the same same thing .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^aap
C :  Yeah . Once we know which segmentations we 're using .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h|s^ba
C :  Um , I I agree that that would be an interesting thing to do ,

dialogue type : s^ng^rt
C :  but I sort of regard it as secondary .

dialogue type : s
C :  So if there 's sort of machines sitting around and people sitting around and they 're waiting for other things to finish , then sure .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  Cuz , I mean , you could imagine a fantasy in which you said that Dave 's processing made the , uh , far microphone like the near microphone .

dialogue type : s
C :  In which case you shouldn't have to actually retrain .

dialogue type : s
C :  But it 's it 's not really true .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  It 's it 's sort of fantasy .

dialogue type : s
C :  It does it does muck up the data in in some funny ways .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And so ,

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm I 'm kind of questioning that .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Uh , that 's right .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
C :  I mean the other thing which which it might come in to is if there was some problem in the retraining .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  I mean , maybe you 'd just have some mechanical thing we do wrong .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , that , uh since Dave 's experience was that it didn't help as much if you didn't retrain , but it does help some , that we would hopefully see that .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  So , that that 's that 's true .

dialogue type : %-
C :  I i

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  I mean , do you ha do you have to rely on his segmentations at all to do the top one ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh . OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Got it .

dialogue type : s
C :  We we talked about this before .

dialogue type : s
C :  I think what we were saying was that , um , the very fact that in both cases we 're ignoring the overlap section means that , um , uh , we 're to some extent finessing that .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  I think , for the purposes of just determining whether a far - field microphone uh , what the effect of the far - field microphone is , we should do the same to both .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s^df^ng
C :  We want to i incorporate certain data that would not be available during final tests , uh , under a a full fair test of it , much as we are in the all the numbers that we have so far .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  We we simply wanna determine what 's the difference in performance due to being distant versus close .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean to a lesser extent you had that same magic the other way , too ,

dialogue type : s^bu^df
C :  because you have leakage into other microphones .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
C :  But , it 's just you 're using the fact that this is where this person is .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh
C :  So .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  It 's just easier to do .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw.%-
C :  So , how do you determine what you use to group together to be a a ?

dialogue type : s
C :  The only other alternative would be to turn off speaker adaptation in both .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  Yeah . An - and e so that will tell us what the difference it between the mikes ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  The the other difference that we 'd have to take care of is that ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  uh yeah , we we don't have a mike that , uh , is particular to a person .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so we 'll have to do some clustering ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and that 'll be another another , uh , issue , too .

dialogue type : s^bd
C :  But , it it I could be wrong ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  the the level of degradation that you get from having the distant mike in a normal acoustic is much greater than what you get from , say , not applying speaker adaptation or applying speaker adaptation .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , we 'll see .

dialogue type : s
C :  But but , I think that the kind of gains that we 've seen from speaker adaptation on Hub - five sort of things are like a few percent .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^nd
C :  It doesn't make that much difference , I think .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  I would doubt that it would be a huge amount of difference for that .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  So , I mean , I I think that that difference would definitely be marginal .

dialogue type : s^cs
C : 

dialogue type : s^cs^e
C :  to do some cepstral mean subtraction on some level .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And , uh , so what 's different about this processing is just that we 're doing it at a much longer time scale .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  Right ?

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : h|s^am
C :  Um . Yeah , I guess .

dialogue type : fh
C :  But , um ,

dialogue type : s^bd^cs
C :  I also think that a again once we got into it , that , um , using some kind of clustering would probably work reasonably well there , too .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  Certainly for the the two microphone case ,

dialogue type : s
C :  which we 're not gonna mess with because it 's another whole deal with the low - quality microphones ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  we ought to be able to at least tell that it appears that things are coming from a particular direction .

dialogue type : s
C :  So we ought to be able to use that information , um , as well .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  But , I think we might be able to do not too bad a job of separating out sp uh , segments that appear to come from a single speaker

dialogue type : s^e
C :  both in terms of s acoustic similarity and in terms of direction .

dialogue type : s^bd
C :  So , I mean But that 's another research thing to do

dialogue type : s^bd^e
C :  and probably won't get done the next week .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , I mean , I 'm I 'm leaving for for the , uh , the New Orleans meeting , uh , next Saturday ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  and and , um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  it 'd be kinda nice to have some results at least a day or two before that , so that I could figure out what I wanted to say about it .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Uh , not to mention that that , uh , Mari 's putting together this report next week , too , you know .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So Uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  what we were hoping was that over the weekend we could do , uh , the , um , calculation on the training set

dialogue type : h
C : 

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  uh , maybe , you know , we could by the end of the weekend , we could have the top one ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  and and then early next week , do these .

dialogue type : s
C :  If we had enough machines , maybe do them in parallel .

dialogue type : s
C :  So that by the middle of the week we had s had some kind of result .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , it 's it 's one of these Hail Mary kinds of things .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bd
C :  it , uh might might not work out .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , uh , f figured I may as well ask for it .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^j^rt
C :  You have models of short males ?

dialogue type : s
C :  I think Markham 's out on vacation .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  I think , che check with Dave .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I thought they were like mushrooms .

dialogue type : s
C :  They 're popping up .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Cuz we still all have tha the that other one going ,

dialogue type : s
C :  which is the , uh the Macrophone training .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  That was in the Hub - five small training set ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^am
C :  I wonder about that , though .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , because all we 're doing The only reason we 're using the short training set is is for speed .

dialogue type : s
C :  And there we 're not really making any claims about using a smaller training set .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
C : 

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu
C :  Oh , you mean for for his normalizations .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^fa
C :  Oh , oh , oh . I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^br^co
C :  Say this again ?

dialogue type : s^fa|s^df
C :  Sorry I missed it .

dialogue type : s^aap
C :  He throws out some speakers that are that are very small .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
C :  Yeah . I think there was only a few

dialogue type : s
C :  we thought to be the case .

dialogue type : qy^d^g.%-
C :  Righ - ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  At that one ? Maybe .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt^t
C :  Been looking at synthesizers ?

dialogue type : s
C :  You were looking at Festival .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  This was a business about , uh , um , coming up with something that that was purely prosodic .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so , uh , we 're just gonna use a pitch detector ,

dialogue type : s
C :  drive a synthesizer ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and since it doesn't have a hook in it for , uh , modifying energy , we 'll have a little box at the output that 'll modify the energy .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^rt
C :  So . Rrrrr - rrrrm

dialogue type : s
C :  Something like that .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt^tc

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt^tc
C :  Digits ?
