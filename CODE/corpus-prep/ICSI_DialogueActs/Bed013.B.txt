dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : %
B :  Whew !

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  I almost forgot about the meeting .

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  I woke up twenty minutes ago , thinking , what did I forget ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Internal alarms .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : qw
B :  Now what are y what are you doing there ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I forgot ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  God bless America .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  Wait , aren't you flying on Lufthansa though ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba^rt
B :  Oh . Well then the you know , it 's not a big deal .

dialogue type : s
B :  Once you get to the United States it 'll be a problem ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but

dialogue type : qw^bu^d.%-
B :  On ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , like in AI they generally do the take in ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and then they also do the generation phase , like Nancy 's thing .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Or uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  you remember , in the the hand thing in one - eighty - two , like not only was it able to recognize but it was also to generate based upon situations .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  You mean that sort of thing ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well then , he probably

dialogue type : s^aap
B :  Well , once the system understands things .

dialogue type : s
B :  I just don't think I think we 're probably a year away from getting the system to understand things .

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
B :  The basic idea I guess would be to give allow the system to have intentions , basically ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Cuz that 's basically what needs to be added to the system for it .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well we 'd have to seed that ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  I mean .

dialogue type : s
B :  It wouldn't know what to ask .

dialogue type : %--
B :  I mean .

dialogue type : s
B :  Unless it was in a situation .

dialogue type : s
B :  We 'd have to set up a situation where , it didn't know where something was and it wanted to go there .

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
B :  Which means that we 'd need to set up an intention inside of the system . Right ?

dialogue type : s^e:s
B :  Which is basically , " I don't know where something is and I need to go there " .

dialogue type : s^ar|s^nd
B :  Well , no I guess not .

dialogue type : %--
B :  Excel

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Sure .

dialogue type : s^aap|s^aa
B :  Well , it will d r assign values to all the nodes . Yes .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I guess what I 'm afraid of is if we don't , you know , set up a situation , we 'll just get a bunch of garbage out ,

dialogue type : s
B :  like you know , everything 's exactly thirty percent .

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Well that was that was absurdly low , in the last meeting ,

dialogue type : s
B :  cuz I went and looked at it

dialogue type : s:s
B :  cuz I was thinking , that could not be right ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk^m
B :  thirty input nodes .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  Let 's see , so it would be two to the thirty for every output node ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Which is very th very large .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  Well , I 'm talking about

dialogue type : s
B :  Oh , I was gonna take a drink of my water .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I 'm talking about billions and billions and billions and

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  two to the thirty is like a

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  Bhaskara said , we had calculated out and Bhaskara believes that it 's larger than the number of particles in the universe .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  And if i

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Two to the thirty ?

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , two to the thirty is a billion ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but if we have to do it two to the twenty times , then that 's a very very large number .

dialogue type : s
B :  Cuz you have to query the node , for every a uh , or query the net two to the twenty times .

dialogue type : s^bsc.%--
B :  Or not two to th

dialogue type : s^fa|s^bsc
B :  excuse me , twenty times .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^e.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
B :  That 's @ @ That 's big .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Oh ! We calculated a different number before .

dialogue type : qw
B :  How did we do that ?

dialogue type : s
B :  If it takes us a second to do , for each one , and let 's say it 's twenty billion , then that 's twenty billion seconds ,

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^co
B :  Eva , do the math .

dialogue type : s
B :  Hours and hours and hours and hours .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  But we can do randomized testing .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Which probabilistically will be good enough .

dialogue type : s^co|qw^rt
B :  Wait , who ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Oh ! My advisor !

dialogue type : s
B :  I 'm gonna work on that today and tomorrow .

dialogue type : s
B :  I 'm gonna finish it today , uh hopefully .

dialogue type : s
B :  I wanna do one of those things where I stay here .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Cuz uh , if I go home , I can't finish it .

dialogue type : s^df^e:s
B :  I 've tried about five times so far , where I work for a while and then I 'm like , I 'm hungry .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  Either that or I think to myself , I can work at home .

dialogue type : s
B :  And then I try to work at home , but I fail miserably .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Like I ended up at Blakes last night .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  No .

dialogue type : s
B :  I almost got into a brawl .

dialogue type : s
B :  But I did not finish the uh ,

dialogue type : s
B :  But I 've been looking into it .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  I think

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  I will try to work on the SmartKom stuff

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and I 'll if I can finish it today , I 'll help you with that tomorrow ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  if you work on it ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I don't have a problem with us working on it though ?

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean we just I mean it wouldn't hurt to write up a paper ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz then , I mean , yeah I was talking with Nancy

dialogue type : s^df^e:s
B :  and Nancy said , you don't know whether you have a paper to write up until you write it up .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  And since Jerry 's coming back , we can run it by him too .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt
B :  Wait , is this a computer science conference

dialogue type : qrr.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , I really can't keep a straight face doing anything .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Did Ben harass you ?

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Good .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh .

dialogue type : s
B :  No wait . You have to put it on exactly like that ,

dialogue type : s^rt

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  See the p how the plastic things ar arch out like that ?

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
B :  Well , you said it was four thousand lines ?

dialogue type : qy^e.%-
B :  Is that what you s

dialogue type : s
B :  I would say that 's closer to six pages actually .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Four thousand lines of ASCII ?

dialogue type : qw^j^rt
B :  How many characters are on a line ?

dialogue type : s
B :  I got an email .

dialogue type : s:s
B :  By the way , Keith is comfortable with us calling him " cool Keith " .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^aa^j|s^j
B :  Yeah , you might get blacklisted .

dialogue type : qy
B :  Remember I came in and I started asking you about how we were sor going to sort out the uh , decision nodes ?

dialogue type : s:s
B :  I remember you talking to me , just not what you said .

dialogue type : s^rt
B : 

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  You know , it was whether it was whether we would have a Bayes - net on the output and on the input ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt
B :  or whether the construction was gonna be in the Bayes - net ,

dialogue type : s
B :  a and outside of it ,

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Well that was related to what we were talking about .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah sure .

dialogue type : qw^br^rt
B :  What ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , oh , oh , oh .

dialogue type : s
B :  I 've blocked every aspect of Phil Collins out of my mind .

dialogue type : qw
B :  Wait , what are the dots ?

dialogue type : s^df^no
B :  I don't remember what the dots were .

dialogue type : b
B :  Oh , oh .

dialogue type : s
B :  I 'd I 'd never seen it before either .

dialogue type : s|s^aa
B :  You can dynamically look up keys , yeah .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  And then grep , basically .

dialogue type : s^df|s^fa
B :  Uh s I was just dancing , sorry .

dialogue type : s^bk.%
B : 

dialogue type : %-
B :  We

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : %
B :  Hhh .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^nd^no
B :  I don't see unde how we would be able to distinguish between the two intentions just from the g utterance , though .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  I mean , uh bef or , before we don't before we cranked it through the Bayes - net .

dialogue type : fh
B :  I mean .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  We would ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
B :  but then so basically it 's just a for every construction we have a node in the net , right ?

dialogue type : s
B :  And we turn on that node .

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  I d I just I don't like having characterizing the constructions with location and path ,

dialogue type : s
B :  or li characterizing them like that .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Cuz you don't It seems like in the general case you wouldn't know how how to characterize them .

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  I mean or , for when .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I mean it just seems like @ @ has to have uh a node for the construction and then let the chips fall where they may .

dialogue type : s
B :  Versus uh , saying , this construction either can mean location or path .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , in this cas and since since it can mean either of those things , it would light both of those up .

dialogue type : qo
B :  Thoughts ?

dialogue type : qo
B :  Questions ?

dialogue type : qo
B :  Answers ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Mmm , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
