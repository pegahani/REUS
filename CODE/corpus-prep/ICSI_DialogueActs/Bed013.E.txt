dialogue type : s^nd^no
E :  Mmm , I don't know .

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  e I 'm sort of have the impression that getting it to say the right thing in the right circumstances is much more difficult than getting it to understand something given the circumstances and so on ,

dialogue type : s^df^e|qy^d^f^g
E :  you know , I mean just cuz it 's sort of harder to learn to speak correctly in a foreign language , rather than learning to understand it . Right ?

dialogue type : %--
E :  I mean

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g
E :  just the fact that we 'll get The point is that getting it to understand one construction doesn't mean that it will n always know exactly when it 's correct to use that construction . Right ?

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bu

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 's pretty big , though .

dialogue type : s
E :  I remember there being some other one floating around .

dialogue type : fh
E :  But anyway , uh .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Yeah , it 's g Anyway , the point is that given all of these different factors , it 's uh e it 's it 's still going to be impossible to run through all of the possible situations or whatever .

dialogue type : s|qy^d^f^g

dialogue type : s.%--

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s:s
E :  I I didn't really know what to do with it ,

dialogue type : s^bu
E :  like , this is the sort of the basic outline of the system or whatever ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  or

dialogue type : s:s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
E :  " here 's an idea " , right ?

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s:s
E :  " here 's here 's one possible thing you could do " ,

dialogue type : s
E :  short ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  eight pages ,

dialogue type : s^no
E :  and I just don't know what you have in mind for expanding .

dialogue type : s
E :  Like I 'd I what I didn't do is go to the web site of the conference

dialogue type : s
E :  and look at what they 're looking for or whatever .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Right . Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^ba|s

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^aa

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^j

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s:qw

dialogue type : b
E :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^df.%-
E : 

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  yeah , looking at that paper that that you had , I mean you know , like , you didn't really explain in detail what was going on in the XML cases or whatever

dialogue type : s:s
E :  you just sorta said well , you know , here 's the general idea ,

dialogue type : s
E :  some stuff gets put in there .

dialogue type : s
E :  You know , hopefully you can you can say something like constituents tells you what the construction is made out of , you know , without going into this intense detail .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  Give them the one paragraph whirlwind tour of w w what this is for ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  and Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  I think so .

dialogue type : s
E :  Oh I saw the diagram in the office ,

dialogue type : s
E :  Way !

dialogue type : s
E :  Oh , god , I hope not .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : qw^rt

E : 

dialogue type : s|s^bk
E :  Discourse is all things linguistic , yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Uh , so , wait so um , since this since this sort of technical stuff is going over my head ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  the the point is that you uh that when someone 's talking about a castle , you know that it 's the sort of thing that people are likely to wanna go into ?

dialogue type : qrr
E :  Or , is it the fact that if there 's an admission fee , then one of the things we know about admission fees is that you pay them in order to go in ?

dialogue type : s^bu^rt
E :  And then the idea of entering is active in the discourse or something ? And then

dialogue type : s^e
E :  blah - blah - blah ?

dialogue type : fh
E :  I mean .

dialogue type : b
E :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : fg

dialogue type : s^co

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^bu:qw
E :  OK . But you 're still doing look up so that when the person So the point is that when the person says , " where is it ? " then you sort of say , let 's go back and look at other things and then decide ,

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  You know like w

dialogue type : s:qw
E :  prior to the " where is it " question they say , you know , " how much does it cost to get in , you know , to to see a movie around here " ,

dialogue type : fh|s:qw
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  The the the point is that by mentioning admission fees , that just sort of stays active now .

dialogue type : s
E :  You know . That becomes part of like , their sort of current ongoing active conceptual structure .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then , um , over in your Bayes - net or whatever , when when the person says " where is it " , you 've already got , you know since they were talking about admission , and that evokes the idea of entering , um , then when they go and ask " where is it " , then you 're Enter node is already active

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because that 's what the person is thinking about .

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean that 's the sort of cognitive linguistic - y way ,

dialogue type : s^bd
E :  and probably not practical .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mmm , yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : b

E :  Well we were

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s^bu.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g
E :  I mean we 're talking about sort of anything that has the semantics of request for location , right ?

dialogue type : %--
E :  actually ?

dialogue type : %--
E :  Or ,

dialogue type : s|qy^d^g
E :  I mean , anyway , the node in the uh the ultimate , uh , in in the Bayes - net thing when you 're done , the the node that we 're talking about um , is one that says " request for location , true " , or something like that , right ?

dialogue type : s^bu:qw|qy^d^g
E :  Um , and and exactly how that gets activated , you know , like whether we want the sentence " how do I get there ? " to activate that node or not , you know , that 's that 's sort of the issue that sort of the linguistic - y side has to deal with , right ?

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : qh
E :  but why would you care about this ?

dialogue type : s|s^f
