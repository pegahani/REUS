dialogue type : z
B :  OK .

dialogue type : z
B :  You know how to toggle the display width function

dialogue type : z
B :  Yo .

dialogue type : h
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  uh in a in a smaller group we had uh , talked and decided about continuation of the data collection .

dialogue type : s
B :  So Fey 's time with us is almost officially over ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  and she brought us some thirty subjects and , t collected the data ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and ten dialogues have been transcribed

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  and can be looked at .

dialogue type : s^co^rt
B :  If you 're interested in that , talk to me .

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  Um , and we found another uh , cogsci student who 's interested in playing wizard for us .

dialogue type : s
B :  Here we 're gonna make it a little bit more complicated for the subjects , uh this round .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  She 's actually suggested to look um , at the psychology department students ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  because they have to partake in two experiments in order to fulfill some requirements .

dialogue type : s^df^e
B :  So they have to be subjected , before they can actually graduate .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  we want to design it so that they really have to think about having some time ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  two days , for example ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  to plan certain things and figure out which can be done at what time ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and ,

dialogue type : fh|s^e
B :  um , sort of package the whole thing in a in a re in a few more complicated um , structure .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  That 's for the data collection .

dialogue type : s
B :  As for SmartKom , I 'm the last SmartKom meeting I mentioned that we have some problems with the synthesis ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  which as of this morning should be resolved .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , so ,

dialogue type : s:s
B :  " should be " means they aren't yet ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  but but I think I have the info now that I need .

dialogue type : s
B :  Plus , Johno and I are meeting tomorrow ,

dialogue type : s^am
B :  so maybe uh uh , when tomorrow is over , we 're done .

dialogue type : s
B :  And ha n hav we 'll never have to look at it again

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Maybe it 'll take some more time ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  to be realistic ,

dialogue type : s
B :  but at least we 're we 're seeing the end of the tunnel there .

dialogue type : s^rt^tc
B :  That was that .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  the uh ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  uh I don't think we need to discuss the formalism

dialogue type : s^df^rt
B :  that 'll be done officially s once we 're done .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
B :  something happened , in on Eva 's side with the PRM that we 're gonna look at today ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  and um ,

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  we have a visitor from Bruchsal from the International University .

dialogue type : s
B :  Andreas , I think you 've met everyone except Nancy .

dialogue type : s^m
B :  Hi . Hi .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  Andy , you actually go by Andy ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : fh.%
B : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
B :  That will be Reuter ?

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  So my scientific director of the EML is also the dean of the International University ,

dialogue type : s
B :  one of his many occupations that just contributes to the fact that he is very occupied .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And , um ,

dialogue type : %--
B : 

dialogue type : fh|s^t
B :  um , he @ @ might tell us a little bit about what he 's actually doing ,

dialogue type : s
B :  and why it is s somewhat related ,

dialogue type : s^df
B :  and by uh using maybe some of the same technologies that we are using .

dialogue type : fh|qy^rt
B :  And um . Was that enough of an update ?

dialogue type : qy^t^tc
B :  In what order shall we proceed ?

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Um - hmm , um , well , first of all uh , uh , great looks , mu much cleaner ,

dialogue type : %
B :  nnn , nnn ,

dialogue type : s
B :  Certain certain beauty in it ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so , um , if beauty is truth , then , uh we 're in good shape .

dialogue type : fh
B :  But ,

dialogue type : %--
B :  the um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  as , uh , mentioned before we probably should look at t the details .

dialogue type : s
B :  So if you have a write - up then uh , I 'd love to read it

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  because , um ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  i Can you go all the way back to the the very top ?

dialogue type : fh|qy^rt
B :  Um , uh these @ @ these w w when these are instantiated they take on the same values ? that we had before ?

dialogue type : qrr
B :  or are they have they changed , in a sense ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
B :  And the , uh , other question I would have is that presumably , from the way the Stanford people talk about it , you can put the probabilities also on the relations .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's sort of in the definition or in the in Daphne 's definition of a PRM

dialogue type : s^e
B :  is that classes and relations ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and you 're gonna have CPT 's over the classes and their relations .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  I should say .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , that would be exactly my question .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  Then I think the w long term perspective is is pretty clear .

dialogue type : s^co
B :  We get rocking and rolling on this again , once we get a package ,

dialogue type : s^e:qw
B :  if , when , and how ,

dialogue type : s
B :  then this becomes foregrounded

dialogue type : s^e
B :  profiled ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  focused , again .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And um ,

dialogue type : s^cc^rt
B :  until then we 'll come up with a something that 's @ @ that 's way more complicated for you .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because this was laughingly easy ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^na.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qw^j^rt
B :  But what does it uh Would a pote potential result be to to split up and never talk to each other again ?

dialogue type : b
B :  You know .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^t^tc
B :  Good . Then , we can move on and see what Andreas has got out his sleeve .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Or Andy , for that matter ?

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
B :  Well , in a in one t one s mmm , small difference in a in a way , is that he doesn't have to come up with an answer ,

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  but he wants to point to the places w w

dialogue type : s^ng
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  Remember the uh , Prashant story ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  The absolutely no no linguistic background person that the IU sent over here .

dialogue type : s^e
B :  And Andreas and I tried to come up wi or we had come up actually with a eh with him working on an interface for FrameNet , as it was back then , that would p do some of the work for this machine ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  which uh , never got done because Prashant found a happy occupation

dialogue type : s^e.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Absolutely . Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  But so I 'm just saying , the uh , we had that idea

dialogue type : s^e
B :  uh to to exploit FrameNet there as well .

dialogue type : fh
B :  And um .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  And Srini 's doing information extraction also ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  with that FrameNet base .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  Uh it 's in the program ?

dialogue type : s^co
B :  You are being recorded right now , so beware .

dialogue type : qw^rt
B :  Who ?

dialogue type : s^cc
B :  I can take you to his office .

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's just around the corner .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah . I 'm sure .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  No . Wh - I had something in my calendar .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^j
B :  Uh well , maybe I can I can bribe my way out of this .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s
B :  So I did some double checking

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  and it seems like spring break in two thousand one .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  This uh Oh , they refused the budget again ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Is it so about CITRIS ?

dialogue type : s^e
B :  Yeah , still nothing .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  OK . So I I did manage to get pull my head out of the sling by sidetracking into CITRIS ,

dialogue type : s^bsc
B :  but uh or a temporarily putting it out of the sling

dialogue type : s
B :  but , I I 'll volunteer to put it right back in by stating that I am n uh among some other things in the process of writing up stuff that we have been discussing at our daily meetings ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
B :  and also revising ,

dialogue type : s^ft
B :  thanks for all the comments ,

dialogue type : s^e
B :  the c the original construal proposal .

dialogue type : s
B :  And , if I put one and one together , I may end up with a number that 's greater than one and that I I can potentially present once you get back .

dialogue type : s^nd.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Absolutely . Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  But um , and hopefully all sidetracking um , other things will have disappeared , soon .
