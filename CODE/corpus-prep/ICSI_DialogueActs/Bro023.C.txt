dialogue type : s
C :  And uh Hans - uh , Hans - Guenter will be here , um , I think by next next Tuesday or so .

dialogue type : s
C :  So he 's he 's going to be here for about three weeks ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  and ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : h|s^am
C :  Uh , we 'll see .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  We might might end up with some longer collaboration or something .

dialogue type : s
C :  So he 's gonna look in on everything we 're doing

dialogue type : s
C :  and give us his his thoughts .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so it 'll be another another good person looking at things .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa^r
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  No , he 'll be around for three weeks .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  He 's , uh , um , very , very , easygoing ,

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  easy to talk to ,

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  and , uh , very interested in everything .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa^r
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  yeah , he 's been here before .

dialogue type : s.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  N nine months .

dialogue type : s
C :  Something like that .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  He 's he 's done a couple stays here .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : h
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
C :  yeah , I mean , it was pretty it was pretty tiny .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  But it but looking at it the other way , isn't it what you 're saying that it didn't help you to have the longer time for training ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qw
C :  I mean , why would you do it , if you knew that you were going to have short windows in testing .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar|s
C :  No , total .

dialogue type : s
C :  The other thing , um , which maybe relates a little bit to something else we 've talked about in terms of windowing and so on is , that , um , I wonder if you trained with twelve seconds , and then when you were two seconds in you used two seconds ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and when you were four seconds in , you used four seconds ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  and you basically build up to the twelve seconds .

dialogue type : s
C :  So that if you have very long utterances you have the best ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but if you have shorter utterances you use what you can .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , the other way of looking at this , going back to , uh , mean cepstral subtraction versus RASTA kind of things , is that you could look at mean cepstral subtraction ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  especially the way you 're doing it , uh , as being a kind of filter .

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  And so , the other thing is just to design a filter .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  You know , basically you 're you 're you 're doing a high - pass filter or a band - pass filter of some sort

dialogue type : s
C :  and and just design a filter .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  And then , you know , a filter will have a certain behavior

dialogue type : s^df
C :  and you loo can look at the start up behavior when you start up with nothing .

dialogue type : s
C :  And and , you know , it will , uh , if you have an IIR filter for instance , it will , um , uh , not behave in the steady - state way that you would like it to behave until you get a long enough period ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  but , um ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  by just constraining yourself to have your filter be only a subtraction of the mean , you 're kind of , you know , tying your hands behind your back

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because there 's filters have all sorts of be temporal and spectral behaviors .

dialogue type : s
C :  And the only thing , you know , consistent that we know about is that you want to get rid of the very low frequency component .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa^r
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
C :  Yeah , and again , if you take this filtering perspective and if you essentially have it build up over time .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , if you computed means over two and then over four , and over six , essentially what you 're getting at is a kind of , uh , ramp up of a filter anyway .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so you may may just want to think of it as a filter .

dialogue type : s
C :  But , uh , if you do that , then , um , in practice somebody using the SmartKom system , one would think if they 're using it for a while , it means that their first utterance , instead of , you know , getting , uh , a forty percent error rate reduction , they 'll get a uh , over what , uh , you 'd get without this , uh , um , policy , uh , you get thirty percent .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then the second utterance that you give , they get the full you know , uh , full benefit of it if it 's this ongoing thing .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Well , I 'm saying in practice , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  that 's If somebody 's using a system to ask for directions or something ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  you know , they 'll say something first .

dialogue type : s:qw
C :  And and to begin with if it doesn't get them quite right , ma m maybe they 'll come back and say , " excuse me ? "

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean it should have some policy like that anyway .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And and , uh ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  uh , in any event they might ask a second question .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it 's not like what he 's doing doesn't , uh , improve things .

dialogue type : s
C :  It does improve things ,

dialogue type : s^e
C :  just not as much as he would like .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  And so , uh , there 's a higher probability of it making an error , uh , in the first utterance .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  Oh , the other thing I guess which which ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't know much about as much as I should about the rest of the system

dialogue type : fh
C :  but but , um ,

dialogue type : qy^cs.%--
C :  couldn't you , uh , if you if you sort of did a first pass

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I don't know what kind of , uh , uh , capability we have at the moment for for doing second passes on on , uh , uh , some kind of little small lattice , or a graph , or confusion network , or something .

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  But if you did first pass with , um , the with either without the mean sub subtraction or with a a very short time one ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and then , um , once you , uh , actually had the whole utterance in , if you did , um , the , uh , uh , longer time version then , based on everything that you had , um , and then at that point only used it to distinguish between , you know , top N , um , possible utterances or something , you you might it might not take very much time .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , I know in the large vocabulary stu uh , uh , systems , people were evaluating on in the past , some people really pushed everything in to make it in one pass

dialogue type : s
C :  but other people didn't and had multiple passes .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And , um ,

dialogue type : s:s
C :  the argument , um , against multiple passes was u u has often been " but we want to this to be r you know have a nice interactive response " .

dialogue type : s:s^bk
C :  And the counterargument to that which , say , uh , BBN I think had , was " yeah ,

dialogue type : s:s
C :  but our second responses are second , uh , passes and third passes are really , really fast " .

dialogue type : fh|qh
C :  So , um , if if your second pass takes a millisecond who cares ?

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  so if it turned out to be a problem , that you didn't have enough speech because you need a longer longer window to do this processing , then , uh , one tactic is you know , looking at the larger system and not just at the front - end stuff is to take in , um , the speech with some simpler mechanism or shorter time mechanism ,

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  um , do the best you can , and come up with some al possible alternates of what might have been said .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  And , uh , either in the form of an N - best list or in the form of a lattice , or or confusion network , or whatever .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then the decoding of that is much , much faster or can be much , much faster if it isn't a big bushy network .

dialogue type : s
C :  And you can decode that now with speech that you 've actually processed using this longer time , uh , subtraction .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  So I mean , it 's it 's common that people do this sort of thing where they do more things that are more complex or require looking over more time , whatever , in some kind of second pass .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  um , and again , if the second pass is really , really fast Uh , another one I 've heard of is is in in connected digit stuff , um , going back and l and through backtrace and finding regions that are considered to be a d a digit , but , uh , which have very low energy .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  So , uh I mean , there 's lots of things you can do in second passes , at all sorts of levels .

dialogue type : s
C :  Anyway , I 'm throwing too many things out .

dialogue type : fh
C :  But .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Is that using in combination with something else ?

dialogue type : s^e.%-
C : 

dialogue type : s^ar
C :  No , no ,

dialogue type : qr^rt
C :  but I mean in combination with our on - line normalization or with the LDA ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : fg|qy^rt
C :  So , does it g does that mean it gets worse ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  Or ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : s
C :  But that 's what I 'm confused about ,

dialogue type : s^bu^df
C :  cuz I think I thought that our system was more like forty percent without the Wiener filtering .

dialogue type : fg|s
C :  So I mean , if you can do all these in word errors it 's a lot a lot easier actually .

dialogue type : s^r|qy^d^f^g^rt
C :  If you do all these in word error rates it 's a lot easier , right ?

dialogue type : fh
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  cuz then you can figure out the percentages .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : qw
C :  so what 's it start on ?

dialogue type : qw^d
C :  The MFCC baseline is is what ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  Is at what level ?

dialogue type : s^ar|qw
C :  No , what 's what 's the number ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
C :  Four point three .

dialogue type : qw
C :  What 's ten point seven ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Ah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
C :  four point three ,

dialogue type : s
C :  ten point seven ,

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  Not changed .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
C :  Eighteen point five .

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  And what were you just describing ?

dialogue type : qw
C :  But where 's the , uh , on - line normalization and so on ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK ,

dialogue type : qw.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qw
C :  an and what are we talking about here ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Is this TI - digits

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qy^2^rt
C :  Italian ?

dialogue type : qw.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qw
C :  So , what was the , um , uh , corresponding number , say , for , um , uh , the Alcatel system for instance ?

dialogue type : qy.%
C :  Do you know ?

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  But it 's a pretty similar number in any event .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  But again , you 're you 're more or less doing what they were doing ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw
C :  What 's a channel zero VAD ?

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm I 'm confused about that .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Oh , oh , oh , oh .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : fh
C :  I mean ,

dialogue type : qy.%--
C :  so a are they going to pro

dialogue type : qw
C :  What are they doing to do ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  do we know yet ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  about as far as what they 're what the rules are going to be and what we can use ?

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So it 's not like that 's being done in one place or one time .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  That 's that 's just a rule

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  and we 'd you you were permitted to do that .

dialogue type : qy
C :  Is is that it ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  Oh , so they will send files

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
C :  so everybody will have the same boundaries to work with ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %
C :  c

dialogue type : s^aa^t1
C :  Right

dialogue type : s^t1
C : 

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  It 's all pretty related ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  It 's it 's there 's a di there 's a whole class of techniques where you try in some sense to minimize the noise .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it 's typically a mean square sense , uh uh uh , i in in in some way .

dialogue type : s
C :  And , uh uh , spectral subtraction is is , uh uh , one approach to it .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , in the long run you 're doing the same thing

dialogue type : s
C :  but y but there you make different approximations ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and in spectral subtraction , for instance , there 's a a an estimation factor .

dialogue type : s
C :  You sometimes will figure out what the noise is

dialogue type : s
C :  and you 'll multiply that noise spectrum times some constant and subtract that

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  even though this really should be in the power domain , sometimes people s work in the magnitude domain because it it it works better .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And , uh , uh , you know .

dialogue type : fg
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  yeah , I mean , there 's Car - Carmen 's working on another , on the vector Taylor series .

dialogue type : s
C :  So they were just kind of trying to cover a bunch of different things with this task and see , you know , what are what are the issues for each of them .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  So I 'm I 'm still a little confused .

dialogue type : qy^bu
C :  Is that channel zero information going to be accessible during this test .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : %
C :  Ma

dialogue type : s
C :  Makes sense .

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  Uh , how about the subspace stuff ?

dialogue type : b.%
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b.%
C :  Oh !

dialogue type : fg|qw
C :  Um , uh , what are you doing with negative , uh , powers ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
C :  Yep , there 's all there 's all sorts of , uh , deviations from the ideal here .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I mean , for instance , you 're you 're talking about the signal and noise , um , at a particular point .

dialogue type : s
C :  And even if something is sort of stationary in ster terms of statistics , there 's no guarantee that any particular instantiation or piece of it is exactly a particular number or bounded by a particular range .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , you 're figuring out from some chunk of of of the signal what you think the noise is .

dialogue type : s
C :  Then you 're subtracting that from another chunk ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and there 's absolutely no reason to think that you 'd know that it wouldn't , uh , be negative in some places .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh , on the other hand that just means that in some sense you 've made a mistake

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because you certainly have stra subtracted a bigger number than is due to the noise .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Um Also , we speak the whole where all this stuff comes from is from an assumption that signal and noise are uncorrelated .

dialogue type : s
C :  And that certainly makes sense in s in in a statistical interpretation , that , you know , over , um , all possible realizations that they 're uncorrelated

dialogue type : s
C :  or assuming , uh , ergodicity that i that i um , across time , uh , it 's uncorrelated .

dialogue type : s
C :  But if you just look at a quarter second , uh , and you cross - multiply the two things , uh , you could very well , uh , end up with something that sums to something that 's not zero .

dialogue type : s
C :  So in fact , the two signals could have some relation to one another .

dialogue type : s
C :  And so there 's all sorts of deviations from ideal in this .

dialogue type : s
C :  And and given all that , you could definitely end up with something that 's negative .

dialogue type : s
C :  But if down the road you 're making use of something as if it is a power spectrum , um , then it can be bad to have something negative .

dialogue type : qw
C :  Now , the other thing I wonder about actually is , what if you left it negative ?

dialogue type : qw
C :  What happens ?

dialogue type : s^df.%-
C : 

dialogue type : fh|qy^rt
C :  Um , are you taking the log before you add them up to the mel ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  So the thing is , I wonder how if you put your thresholds after that , I wonder how often you would end up with , uh with negative values .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng|qy^d^g
C :  But nonetheless , uh , you know , these are it 's another f kind of smoothing , right ?

dialogue type : s^e
C :  that you 're doing .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s
C :  So , you 've done your best shot at figuring out what the noise should be ,

dialogue type : s
C :  and now i then you 've subtracted it off .

dialogue type : s
C :  And then after that , instead of instead of , uh , uh , leaving it as is and adding things adding up some neighbors , you artificially push it up .

dialogue type : s
C :  Which is , you know , it 's there 's no particular reason that that 's the right thing to do either ,

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
C :  right ?

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , um ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  uh ,

dialogue type : s:s
C :  i in fact , what you 'd be doing is saying , " well , we 're d we 're we 're going to definitely diminish the effect of this frequency in this little frequency bin in the in the overall mel summation " .

dialogue type : s^bd
C :  It 's just a thought .

dialogue type : s^no.%-
C : 

dialogue type : h|s^aa
C :  Nnn , yeah ,

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but that means that in a situation where you thought that that the bin was almost entirely noise , you left it .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
C :  Well , yeah that 's that 's the opposite ,

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  People can also , uh , reflect it back up and essentially do a full wave rectification instead of a instead of half wave .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  But it was just a thought that that it might be something to try .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
C :  So these numbers he was giving before with the four point three , and the ten point one , and so forth , those were Italian , right ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  But do you have numbers in terms of word error rates on on Italian ? So just so you have some sense of reference ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw^d
C :  And this is , um , spectral subtraction plus what ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  On - line normalization and LDA ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Right .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
C :  plus , uh , I guess they have some sort of cepstral normalization , as well .

dialogue type : s^no
C :  I mean , it 's not clear that these musical noises hurt us in recognition .

dialogue type : s
C :  We don't know if they do .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , they they sound bad .

dialogue type : s
C :  But we 're not listening to it , usually .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  Well , none of these systems , by the way , have I mean , y you both are are working with , um , our system that does not have the neural net ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
C :  right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  So one would hope , presumably , that the neural net part of it would would improve things further as as they did before .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^am
C :  Maybe .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
C :  it could do a nonlinear spectral subtraction

dialogue type : s^no.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I mean , you have to figure out what your targets are .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^nd
C :  Yeah , well , that 's not so much spectral subtraction then ,

dialogue type : s.%--
C :  but but but it 's but at any rate , yeah , people ,

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  y yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
C :  in fact , we had visitors here who did that

dialogue type : s
C :  I think when you were here ba way back when .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Uh ,

dialogue type : s
C :  people d done lots of experimentation over the years with training neural nets .

dialogue type : s
C :  And it 's not a bad thing to do .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's another approach .

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  The objection everyone always raises , which has some truth to it is that , um , it 's good for mapping from a particular noise to clean

dialogue type : s
C :  but then you get a different noise .

dialogue type : s
C :  And the experiments we saw that visitors did here showed that it there was at least some , um , gentleness to the degradation when you switched to different noises .

dialogue type : s
C :  It did seem to help .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  So that you 're right ,

dialogue type : s^na
C :  that 's another another way to go .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Oh , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
C :  it did very well .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but to some extent that 's kind of what we 're doing .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  I mean , we 're not doing exactly that ,

dialogue type : s^df
C :  we 're not trying to generate good examples

dialogue type : s^df.%-
C :  but by trying to do the best classifier you possibly can , for these little phonetic categories ,

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
C :  it 's kind of built into that .

dialogue type : s
C :  And and that 's why we have found that it it does help .

dialogue type : fh
C : 

dialogue type : fh
C :  so ,

dialogue type : fh
C :  um ,

dialogue type : s^bk|s^cs
C :  yeah , I mean , we 'll just have to try it .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  But I I would I would I would imagine that it will help some .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , it we 'll just have to see whether it helps more or less the same ,

dialogue type : s
C :  but I would imagine it would help some .

dialogue type : s
C :  So in any event , all of this I was just confirming that all of this was with a simpler system .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
C :  OK ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  It 's amazing how often that happens .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  One five ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  One five ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  Five zero ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m
C :  Five zero .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qw
C :  What if you just look into the past ?

dialogue type : qw^d
C :  How m by how much ?

dialogue type : qw^d^r
C :  By how much ?

dialogue type : s^bu
C :  Worse .

dialogue type : b
C :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s
C :  It 's depending on how all this stuff comes out

dialogue type : s
C :  we may or may not be able to add any latency .

dialogue type : fg
C :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^bk|s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  I would worry about it a little .

dialogue type : s^df
C :  Because if we completely ignore latency , and then we discover that we really have to do something about it , we 're going to be find ourselves in a bind .

dialogue type : fh
C :  So , um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  you know , maybe you could make it twenty - five .

dialogue type : qy^d^f
C :  You know what I mean ?

dialogue type : s^cs
C :  Yeah , just , you know , just be be a little conservative

dialogue type : s^df
C :  because we may end up with this crunch where all of a sudden we have to cut the latency in half or something .

dialogue type : fh
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qy.%--
C :  isn't it the TCP buffer some ?

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa^r
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  all of that sort of stuff is things that they 're debating in their standards committee .

dialogue type : s
C :  That 'd be more like the JRASTA thing in a sense .

dialogue type : fh
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  I 'm confused .

dialogue type : s
C :  You said five hundred milliseconds

dialogue type : s
C :  but you said sixty - four milliseconds .

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  Which is which ?

dialogue type : qw.%--
C :  What ?

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : b
C :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
C :  So you take sixty - four millisecond F F Ts and then you average them over five hundred ?

dialogue type : qrr.%--
C :  Or ?

dialogue type : fh|qw
C :  Uh , what do you do over five hundred ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  Ah .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s
C :  e I 'm I 'm p s a little confused again ,

dialogue type : %--
C : 

dialogue type : qw.%--
C :  Uh , when you compare it with the V A D - based ,

dialogue type : qy.%-
C :  VAD - Is this is this the ?

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^d
C :  Oh , you 're not doing this with our system ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  But the spectral subtraction scheme that you reported on also re requires a a noise estimate .

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Couldn't you try this for that ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
C :  Do you think it might help ?

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  I see ,

dialogue type : s^bk^r
C :  I see .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
C :  It 's interesting .

dialogue type : s
C :  I mean , um , you know , in in JRASTA we were essentially adding in , uh , white uh , white noise dependent on our estimate of the noise .

dialogue type : s^e
C :  On the overall estimate of the noise .

dialogue type : fh|s
C :  Uh , I think it never occurred to us to use a probability in there .

dialogue type : s
C :  You could imagine one that that that made use of where where the amount that you added in was , uh , a function of the probability of it being s speech or noise .

dialogue type : b
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
C :  Cuz that that brings in sort of powers of classifiers that we don't really have in , uh , this other estimate .

dialogue type : s
C :  So it could be it could be interesting .

dialogue type : qw^rt
C :  What what what point does the , uh , system stop recording ?

dialogue type : qw.%--
C : 

dialogue type : qy^d
C :  It went a little long ?

dialogue type : s.%--
C : 

dialogue type : s^bk
C :  OK .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah , right .

dialogue type : fg
C :  OK .

dialogue type : s
C :  Well , Hans - Guenter will be here next week

dialogue type : s
C :  so I think he 'll be interested in all all of these things .

dialogue type : fh
C :  And , so .

dialogue type : b
C :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
C :  Sure .
