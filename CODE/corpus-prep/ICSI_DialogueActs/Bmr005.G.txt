dialogue type : z
G :  So I think maybe what 's causing it to crash is I keep starting it and then stopping it to see if it 's working .

dialogue type : z
G :  And so I think starting it and then stopping it and starting it again causes it to crash .

dialogue type : z
G :  So , I won't do that anymore .

dialogue type : z
G :  No .

dialogue type : z
G :  I 'm gonna collect the digit forms and write it down .

dialogue type : z
G :  So

dialogue type : z
G :  So they should be right

dialogue type : z
G :  with what 's on the digit forms .

dialogue type : z
G :  OK , so I 'll go ahead and start with digits .

dialogue type : z
G :  u

dialogue type : z
G :  And I should say that uh , you just pau you just read each line an and then pause briefly .

dialogue type : s
G :  And I 'm surprised I sort of I 'm surprised I forgot that ,

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  but uh I think that would be a good thing to add .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  After I just printed out a zillion of them .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
G :  You wanna just go around ?

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Hmm , metaphorically .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  So , do you think his interest is in using this as a data source ,

dialogue type : qrr^rt
G :  or training material ,

dialogue type : qrr
G :  or what ?

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
G :  Wrong ,

dialogue type : b
G :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  And I imagine that transcripts of speech I mean text that is speech probably has more of those than sort of prepared writing .

dialogue type : s^no.x
G :  I I don't know whether it would or not , but it seems like it would .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
G :  Yeah , I 'm just thinking , you know , when you 're when you 're face to face , you have a lot of backchannel

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
G :  And so I think it 's just easier to do that sort of broad inference jumping if it 's face to face .

dialogue type : s^rt:s
G :  I mean , so , if I just read that Dan was saying " we 're ahead of the game " in that in that context ,

dialogue type : s.x
G :  I might not realize that he was talking about disk space as opposed to anything else .

dialogue type : b
G :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2
G :  I guess it would be the same .

dialogue type : s^ng^rt
G :  It 's in my notes .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Well , I think he 's doing that intentionally ,

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
G :  aren't you ?

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  Oh , that would be interesting .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , especially with Morgan , with the way we have the microphones arranged . I 'm sort of right on axis

dialogue type : s
G :  and it would be very hard to tell .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Uh .

dialogue type : s^aap^rt.%--
G :  Sure , but I think if I 'm talking like this ?

dialogue type : s
G :  Right now I 'm looking at Jane and talking ,

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  now I 'm looking at Chuck and talking ,

dialogue type : sj
G :  I don't think the microphones would pick up that difference .

dialogue type : s
G :  So if I 'm talking at you , or I 'm talking at you .

dialogue type : s^2^rt
G :  Lawyers .

dialogue type : s:s
G :  And we did mention who " he " was .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  Early in the conversation .

dialogue type : qy^rt.%--
G :  Do Sh - Can I say

dialogue type : qrr
G :  or or is that just too sensitive ?

dialogue type : s.x
G :  It 's not a meeting .

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  Well , we t we t we talked about this during the anon anonymization .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  If we wanna go through and extract from the audio and the written every time someone says a name .

dialogue type : s^bu
G :  And I thought that our conclusion was that we didn't want to do that .

dialogue type : s.x
G :  Well , the inference structures was Lokendra .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  Oh , I don't think we 've been doing it at that level of detail .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : fg|s^bu
G :  Well You weren't talking about just overlaps

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  were you ?

dialogue type : s^bs
G :  You were just talking about acoustic events .

dialogue type : s
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^fe
G :  Oh , God !

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  Ugh .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  So let 's say me and Jane are talking at the same time ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  and then Liz starts talking also over all of us .

dialogue type : qw
G :  How many events would that be ?

dialogue type : fg|s
G :  So , two people are talking , and then a third person starts talking .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Is there an event right here ?

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  So i if two or more people are talking .

dialogue type : fg|s^na
G :  Well , but But you could imagine that three people talking has a different spectral characteristic than two .

dialogue type : s^2
G :  So . You had to start somewhere .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^m
G :  That 's a lot of overlap ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  yeah ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  for forty - five minutes .

dialogue type : qy.%--
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  The the reason that I generated the mixed file was for IBM to do word level transcription , not speech event transcription .

dialogue type : s
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , if I 'm tapping on the table , you it 's not gonna show up on any of the mikes , but it 's gonna show up rather loudly in the PZM .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  If you use the combination of the close - talking mikes , you would hear Jane interrupting me ,

dialogue type : s^df
G :  but you wouldn't hear the paper rustling .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aap.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , I 'm doing weird normalizations and things like that .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : qy.%-
G :  Did Did you

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  Well , it 's more realistic but it 'll it 'll be a lot harder .

dialogue type : s^bc
G :  Twelve minutes .

dialogue type : s^nd
G :  Well , not just the overlaps , everything .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well , also Jane Jane was doing word level .

dialogue type : s
G :  So we weren't concerned with exactly when an overlap started and stopped .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^nd.%--
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G :  And

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Right .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  That 's what I was gonna bring up .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  I 've I 've written a program to do that ,

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : fh|s
G :  and so but it 's it 's doing something very , very simple .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  It just takes a threshold , based on on the volume ,

dialogue type : fg|s^e
G :  um , and then it does a median filter , and then it looks for runs .

dialogue type : sj
G :  And , it seems to work ,

dialogue type : s
G :  I 've I 'm sort of fiddling with the parameters , to get it to actually generate something ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I don't what I 'm working on was working on was getting it to a form where we can import it into the user interface that we have , into Transcriber .

dialogue type : fh|s^cc
G :  And so I told I said it would take about a day .

dialogue type : s
G :  I 've worked on it for about half a day ,

dialogue type : fh|s^cc
G :  so give me another half day and I we 'll have something we can play with .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s^ft^t3.%
G :  Thanks .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and I haven't tried using that .

dialogue type : s
G :  It would probably help the program that I 'm doing to first feed it through that .

dialogue type : s^e
G :  It 's a cross - correlation filter .

dialogue type : sj
G :  So I I haven't tried that , but that If It it might be something it might be a good way of cleaning it up a little .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Exactly . Yep .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
G :  It seemed like the right thing to do .

dialogue type : s
G :  That was with zero literature search .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  That 's good validation .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Yeah , do you have a patent on it ?

dialogue type : s
G :  Just output .

dialogue type : qw
G : 

dialogue type : s^ba.%
G :  That 's alright .

dialogue type : s
G :  I was doing pretty short , you know , tenth of a second , sorts of numbers .

dialogue type : sj
G :  I b I bet they 're more , because the beginning of the meeting had a lot more overlaps than than sort of the middle .

dialogue type : s^bsc
G :  Middle or end .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  Because i we 're we 're dealing with the Uh , in the early meetings ,

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  we 're recording while we 're saying who 's talking on what microphone , and things like that ,

dialogue type : s
G :  and that seems to be a lot of overlap .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : qw^bu^rt
G :  What 's that ?

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah , something like that .

dialogue type : %-
G :  And then then we

dialogue type : s^ng
G :  Well , I haven't sent them yet because I was having this problem with the missing files .

dialogue type : s
G :  About twelve by now . Twelve or thirteen .

dialogue type : s^ar
G :  Nope .

dialogue type : s
G :  Jerry .

dialogue type : s^na
G :  That 's what we 're aiming for .

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  We 'll find out tomorrow whether we can really do this or not .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s
G :  Actually that 's something I wanted to ask ,

dialogue type : s
G :  is I have a bunch of scripts to help with the transcription of the digits .

dialogue type : s
G :  We don't have to hand - transcribe the digits because we 're reading them and I have those .

dialogue type : s
G :  And so I have some scripts that let you very quickly extract the sections of each utterance .

dialogue type : s
G :  But I haven't been ru I haven't been doing that .

dialogue type : fh|qy^rt
G :  Um , if I did that , is someone gonna be working on it ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  I mean , is it something of interest ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , I I 'm I 'm interested in it ,

dialogue type : s
G :  I just don't have time to do it now .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yep . Yep .

dialogue type : s
G :  I I would really like someone to do adaptation .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  So if we got someone interested in that , I think it would be great for Meeting Recorder .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Since it 's the same people over and over .

dialogue type : s
G :  We had some good ones earlier .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  I think it 's hard to record those .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  Oh , that 's a good idea .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  That 's That would be a good match .

dialogue type : s
G :  Right , as we are .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
G :  Stage some political debates .

dialogue type : s
G :  We don't have to do the digits at all if we don't want to .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
G :  It seems like it 's a big part of this corpus is to have the close - talking mikes .

dialogue type : h|s
G :  Well , I 've been burning two C Ds a day , which is about all I can do with the time I have .

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  So it 'll be early next week .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^aap.%--
G : 

dialogue type : qy^bh
G :  Yeah , who knows where they are .

dialogue type : s^ar
G :  Nope .

dialogue type : s
G :  Yeah , you we can't complain .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
G :  Yep . I think that 's probably true .

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's pipeline , pipeline issues .

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  Once the pipeline fills .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
G :  Oh , and we 're just chatting ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yeah , we have a lot of those .

dialogue type : s^am|s
G : 

dialogue type : qy^d^rt:s
G :  You know , our " soccer ball " meeting ?

dialogue type : s
G :  I guess none of you were there for our soccer ball meeting .

dialogue type : sj^ba
G :  That was hilarious .

dialogue type : b
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^ng
G :  I just really doubt that uh any of the State of California meetings would be recordable and then releasable to the general public .

dialogue type : s
G :  So I I mean I talked with some people at the Haas Business School who are i who are interested in speech recognition

dialogue type : s
G :  and , they sort of hummed and hawed and said " well maybe we could have meetings down here " ,

dialogue type : s:s
G :  but then I got email from them that said " no , we decided we 're not really interested and we don't wanna come down and hold meetings . "

dialogue type : s
G :  So , I think it 's gonna be a problem to get people regularly .

dialogue type : b.%
G :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^t
G :  Um . We 're getting towards the end of our disk space ,

dialogue type : fh|s^co
G :  so we should think about trying to wrap up here .

dialogue type : s^co
G :  OK , leave leave them on for a moment until I turn this off , cuz that 's when it crashed last time .
