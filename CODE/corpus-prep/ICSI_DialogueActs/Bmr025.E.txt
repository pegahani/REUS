dialogue type : qh^cs
E :  Why don't you try and merge Transcriber and THISL IR ?

dialogue type : s^df
E :  They 're both Tcl interfaces .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Right .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then you get they then you get the Windows media playing for free .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^df
E :  Right . But the point is that the Transcriber uses Snack and then you can but you can use a a lot of the same functionality

dialogue type : %-
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  Well my thought was is that it would be nice it would be nice to have the running transcripts um eh you know , from speaker to speaker .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  Well if you wanted to do that maybe the right architecture for it is to get a PDA with a wireless card .

dialogue type : s
E :  And and that way you can synchronize very easily with the the the meeting

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , you 'd have to do a little eh a little bit of coding to do it .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  But you could imagine ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , if if all you really wanted was you didn't want this secondary note - taking channel

dialogue type : s
E :  but just sort of being able to use m markers of some sort ,

dialogue type : s^cs

dialogue type : s^e
E :  sort of ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , as you said .

dialogue type : s^aa
