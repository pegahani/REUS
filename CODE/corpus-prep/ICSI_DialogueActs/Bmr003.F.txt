dialogue type : z
E :  OK , this is Jane on channel five .

dialogue type : z
E :  Oh , darn , what am I doing wrong ?

dialogue type : z
E :  Uh , screen no ,

dialogue type : z
E :  it is ,

dialogue type : z
E :  oh , maybe it just warmed up ?

dialogue type : z
E :  Oh , darn ,

dialogue type : z
E :  can you can't see channel five yet ?

dialogue type : z
E :  Oh , this would be k

dialogue type : z
E :  OK ,

dialogue type : z
E :  is that better ?

dialogue type : z
E :  Hello ,

dialogue type : z
E :  hello .

dialogue type : z
E :  Alright .

dialogue type : z
E :  Would you like to join the meeting ?

dialogue type : z
E : 

dialogue type : z
E :  This is abou we 're we 're mainly being taped but we 're gonna talk about , uh , transcription for the m future meeting meetings .

dialogue type : z
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
E :  e

dialogue type : z
E :  OK .

dialogue type : z
E :  Y you 'd be welcome .

dialogue type : z
E :  You 'd be welcome .

dialogue type : z
E :  Why didn't I you were saying that

dialogue type : z
E :  but I could hear you really well on the on the transcription on the , uh , tape .

dialogue type : z
E :  It 's badly designed .

dialogue type : z
E :  So that 's what you 're d He 's got it on his temples so it cuts off his circulation .

dialogue type : z
E :  Try it .

dialogue type : z
E :  We could do it with noise .

dialogue type : z
E :  Uh , this is the same one I had before .

dialogue type : z
E :  No

dialogue type : z
E :  Now , just to be sure , the numbers on the back , this is the channel ?

dialogue type : z
E :  That 's the microphone number .

dialogue type : z
E :  Uh - oh .

dialogue type : z
E :  OK , good .

dialogue type : z
E : 

dialogue type : z
E :  Good .

dialogue type : z
E :  OK .

dialogue type : z
E :  Well , this is Jane , on mike number five .

dialogue type : z
E :  Um .

dialogue type : z
E :  I just start ?

dialogue type : z
E :  Do I need to say anything more ?

dialogue type : z
E :  Uh , you said turn off the what ?

dialogue type : z
E :  Oh .

dialogue type : z
E :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : z
E :  I See .

dialogue type : z
E :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : z
E :  I do wish there were big booms coming down from the ceiling .

dialogue type : z
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : z
E :  Yeah , yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : z
E :  You know .

dialogue type : z
E :  Oh , that 'll be good .

dialogue type : z
E :  OK .

dialogue type : z
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  that 's right .

dialogue type : s
E :  Oh , that 's better .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 's better .

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah , it 's noticeable .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  I think candles would be nice if they don't make noise .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I saw it .

dialogue type : s
E :  I 've been watching for that corpus .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
E :  They had people come in to a certain degree and they and they have DAT recorders .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  I I assume so , actually ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  I hadn't thought about that .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Unless they added close field later on

dialogue type : fh|s
E :  but , um , I 've listened to some of those data

dialogue type : s
E :  and I , um , I 've been I I was actually on the advisory board for when they set the project up .

dialogue type : s
E :  I 'm glad to see that it got released .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  So it it 's a very nice thing .

dialogue type : qr.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Great idea .

dialogue type : s
E :  And and their recording conditions are really clean .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  I mean , I 've I 've heard I 've listened to the data .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^df.%-
E : 

dialogue type : h|s^bk
E :  Um , oh ,

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  good question

dialogue type : s
E :  and I can't ans answer it .

dialogue type : s^no
E :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yep .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  The other thing too is that their their jus their transcription format is really nice and simple in in the discourse domain .

dialogue type : s
E :  But they also mentioned that they have it time aligned .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  I mean , I s I I saw that write - up .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  It 's very nice .

dialogue type : s
E :  CSAE .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Corpus of Spoken American English .

dialogue type : s
E :  Yeah , sp I 've been I was really pleased to see that .

dialogue type : s
E :  I knew that they they had had some funding problems in completing it

dialogue type : fh
E :  but , um ,

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  this is clever .

dialogue type : s
E :  Got it through the LDC .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Great .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Great .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Super .

dialogue type : s^ba^r
E :  Super .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Great .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
E :  Yeah , that I mean , they 're really well respected in the linguistics d side too and the discourse area ,

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  So this is a very good corpus .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s
E :  I did include a glo uh , a certain first pass .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  well , if it 's parenthetical , which I know that Liz has worked on , then uh y y you 'll have different prosodic aspects .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then also if it 's a r if it 's a repair where they 're like what I just did , then it 's nice to have sort of a sense of the continuity of the utterance ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  the start to be to the finish .

dialogue type : fh|s^ba
E : 

dialogue type : s^e
E :  and sometimes or of it 's in the middle .

dialogue type : fg|s
E :  Anyway , so what I was doing was bracketing them to indicate that they were repairs

dialogue type : s^e
E :  which isn't uh , very time - consuming .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
E :  As a pilot study .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  as a pilot study .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  That 's right ,

dialogue type : s^aa^r
E :  that 's right .

dialogue type : s.%-
E :  I wanna hear about these uh , we have a g you were s continuing with the transcription conventions for s

dialogue type : s^ar|%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^fe
E :  I object to that characterization !

dialogue type : s^ft
E :  Oh , thank you .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  Well th there is als

dialogue type : s^na
E :  Yeah , really .

dialogue type : s
E :  There is also the o other possibility which is if you can provide not money but instructional experience or some other perks , you can you could get people to to um , to do it in exchange .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ng
E :  I 'm afraid I haven't made any progress in that front yet .

dialogue type : s
E :  I should 've sent email and I haven't yet .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  I have a bunch of hours ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  Actually that 's the the one people usually use , ten X .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
E : 

dialogue type : qw^bk^rt
E :  How fast am I ?

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  I haven't done a

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  There 's some interesting human factors problems like , yeah , what span of of time is it useful to segment the thing into in order to uh , transcribe it the most quickly .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Cuz then , you know , you get like if you get a span of five words , that 's easy .

dialogue type : s
E :  But then you have to take the time to mark it .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then there 's the issue of it 's easier to hear it th right the first time if you 've marked it at a boundary instead of somewhere in the middle ,

dialogue type : s^df
E :  cuz then the word 's bisected or whatever

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : fh
E :  And

dialogue type : s
E :  so I mean , I 've been sort of playing with , uh , different ways of mar cuz I 'm thinking , you know , I mean , if you could get optimal instructions you could cut back on the number of hours it would take .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  No , it doesn't

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  but what a super tool .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  It 's a great environment .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 's an interesting idea .

dialogue type : s^bk^fe
E :  Hey !

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 's interesting .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : %
E :  I

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 'd be fun .

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No ,

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : s^r
E :  boundary .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 's ideal .

dialogue type : s
E :  Although I was I you know , the alternative , which I was sort of experimenting with before I ran out of time , recently was , um that , you know , ev if it were like an arbitrary segment of time i t pre - marked

dialogue type : s^df
E :  cuz it does take time to put those markings in .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  It 's really the i the interface is wonderful

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because , you know , the time it takes is you listen to it , and then you press the return key .

dialogue type : s
E :  But then , you know , it 's like , uh , you press the tab key to stop the flow and and , uh , the return key to p to put in a marking of the boundary .

dialogue type : s
E :  But , you know , obviously there 's a lag between when you hear it and when you can press the return key

dialogue type : s
E :  so it 's slightly delayed ,

dialogue type : s
E :  so then you you listen to it a second time and move it over to here .

dialogue type : s
E :  So that takes time .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  uh , not in this case .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Oh , interesting point .

dialogue type : s^ba^r
E :  Ah ! Interesting point .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
E :  OK , that would make a difference .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  I mean , it 's not bad

dialogue type : s
E :  but it does take twice .

dialogue type : s^ba^fe
E :  Oh , good point !

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Ah !

dialogue type : s^na
E :  We 've got volume .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Wow .

dialogue type : fg|%-
E :  But but it op

dialogue type : s^fa
E :  I 'm sorry .

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : s^r
E :  wish you 'd told me .

dialogue type : qw^d
E :  At what part ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I 'm alright .

dialogue type : qy^rt
E :  Could you get it so that with so it would it would detect volume on a channel and insert a marker ?

dialogue type : s
E :  And the the format 's really transparent .

dialogue type : s^df.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bu|qy^d^g^rt
E :  it 's XML , isn't it ?

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's very I mean , I looked at the the file format and it 's just it has a t a time a time indication and then something or other , and then an end time or something or other .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
E :  Yes I have .

dialogue type : s^no
E :  S I 'm not sure if it 's that 's much

dialogue type : s
E :  but anyway , enough to work with .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Good idea .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^na
E :  Yeah , that 's what I was thinking .

dialogue type : s
E :  I 'd I 'd be cheating a little bit g with familiarity effect .

dialogue type : s^ar
E :  No .

dialogue type : s
E :  Now , there 's a plan .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^cc^j
E :  I 'll do that tomorrow .

dialogue type : s^j
E :  I should have it finished by the end of the day .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Exactly .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^df
E :  uh , it wasn't a pure task the first time ,

dialogue type : s
E :  so uh , it 's gonna be an upper bound in in that case .

dialogue type : s
E :  And it 's not really strictly comparable .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  So I think though it 's a good proposal to be used on a new a new batch of text that I haven't yet done yet in the same meeting . Could use it on the next segment of the text .

dialogue type : qy.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , I see what you mean .

dialogue type : s|qy^g^rt
E :  Well , but the oracle boundaries would come from volume on a partic specific channel wouldn't they ?

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , I see what you mean .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 's good .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  I like that .

dialogue type : s
E :  And the other thing too is with with speaker identification ,

dialogue type : s
E :  if if that could handle speaker identification that 's a big deal .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^ba
E :  Yeah , I mean , that 's a nice feature .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 'd be so great .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  We didn't finish the the part of work already completed on this ,

dialogue type : qy^g
E :  did we ?

dialogue type : s
E :  I mean , you you talked a little bit about the transcription conventions ,

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  So , I when I i the it 's quickest for me in terms of the transcription part to say something like , you know , if if Adam spoke to , um to just say , " A colon " ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Like who could be , you know , I mean at the beginning of the line .

dialogue type : s
E :  and E colon instead of entering the interface for speaker identification and clicking on the thing , uh , indicating the speaker ID .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , and then he has a script that will convert it into the the thing that , uh , would indicate speaker ID .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  If that 's clear .

dialogue type : s
E :  It 's Perl script .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s^bk|s^na
E :  Yeah , well that 's true ,

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : qw
E :  What i just approximately , what did you find out in terms of price or or whatever ?

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
E :  Of of tape ?

dialogue type : qrr^d
E :  Or of action ?

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh !

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Interesting .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That 's very interesting .

dialogue type : s^co^j
E :  Talk slowly but with few words .

dialogue type : s
E :  There you go .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
E :  We could have some telegraphic meetings .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  That might be interesting .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
E :  I think uh that would give us a a good good estimate .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : qy^bu^d
E :  you 'd say ten ?

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah , that 's right .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  That 's right .

dialogue type : s
E :  And there 's another aspect too .

dialogue type : s
E :  The other thing too is that , uh , if they were linguistics they 'd be you know , in terms of like the post editing , i uh tu uh content wise they might be easier to handle

dialogue type : s^df
E :  cuz they might get it more right the first time .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Good point .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Good point .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Oh , interesting .

dialogue type : h|qy^rt
E :  Um , now would this involve some manner of uh , monetary compensation

dialogue type : qrr
E :  or would I be the voluntary , uh , coordinator of multiple transcribers for checking ?

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh ,

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  I don't wanna stop working for Dave .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Oh , cool .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
E :  We 'll see .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , I see .

dialogue type : fg
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Yeah , I see .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^j
E :  Boy , if I wanted to increase my income I could start doing the transcribing again .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  I see .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Good .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
E : 

dialogue type : s^m^na
E :  more .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yes .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  What Well , you know what I thought was right now we have p

dialogue type : s
E :  So I gave him the proposal for the transcription conventions .

dialogue type : s
E :  He made his , uh , suggestion of improvement .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  The the It 's a good suggestion .

dialogue type : s
E :  So as far as I 'm concerned those transcription conventions are fixed right now .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  They 're very minimal .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , it would be good to just to summarize that .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  So , um , one of them is the idea of how to indicate speaker change ,

dialogue type : s^df
E : 

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Boy , it 's such a nice interface .

dialogue type : s^e.%--
E :  When you when you get the , um you you get the speech signal you also get down beneath it , an indication of , uh ,

dialogue type : s^e
E :  if you have two speakers overlapping in a s in a single segment , you see them one displayed one above each other .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  And then at the same time the top s part of the screen is the actual verbatim thing .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  You can clip click on individual utterances and it 'll take you immediately to that part of the speech signal , and play it for you .

dialogue type : s
E :  And you can , eh you can work pretty well between those two these two things .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh .

dialogue type : %
E :  Ho

dialogue type : b
E :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  Yeah , I do too .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
E :  Pre - lay .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , and they 've thought about things .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  So you have when you when you play it back , um , it 's it is useful to have , uh , a a break mark to se segment it .

dialogue type : s
E :  But it wouldn't be strictly necessary

dialogue type : s^df
E :  cuz you can use the uh , the tabbed key to toggle the sound on and off .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  I mean , it 'll stop the s speech you know if you if you press a tab .

dialogue type : fh
E :  And , um .

dialogue type : fh
E :  And so ,

dialogue type : fh|s^ba
E :  uh , that 's a nice feature .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then also once you 've put a break in then you have the option of cycling through the unit .

dialogue type : s
E :  You could do it like multiply

dialogue type : s^e
E :  until you get crazy and decide to stop cycling through that unit .

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : %
E : 

dialogue type : s^nd
E :  That 's not something I wanted to have happen .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  I see .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  I I agree .

dialogue type : s
E :  They they have several options .

dialogue type : s
E :  So , uh , you know , I mentioned the looping option .

dialogue type : s
E :  Another option is it 'll pause when it reaches the end of the boundary .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  And then to get to the next boundary you just press tab

dialogue type : s^e
E :  and it goes on to the next unit .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  I mean , it 's very nicely thought out .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  and also it 'll go around the c the , uh ,

dialogue type : s
E :  I wanna say cursor

dialogue type : s^no
E :  but I 'm not sure if that 's the right thing .

dialogue type : s
E :  Anyway , you can so they thought about different ways of having windows that you c uh work within ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and But so in terms of the con the conventions , then , uh , basically , uh , it 's strictly orthographic

dialogue type : s^df
E :  which means with some w provisions for , uh , w uh , colloquial forms .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  So if a person said , " cuz " instead of " because " then I put a an apostrophe at the beginning of the word and then in in double ang angle brackets what the full lexical item would be .

dialogue type : s
E :  And this could be something that was handled by a table or something

dialogue type : s
E :  but I think to have a convention marking it as a non - standard or wha I don't mean standard but a a a non uh , ortho orthographic , uh , whatever .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  " Gonna " or " wanna " ,

dialogue type : s
E :  you know , the same thing .

dialogue type : s
E :  And and there would be limits to how much refinement you want in indicating something as non - standard pres pronunciation .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
E :  Backchannels ?

dialogue type : fh
E :  Um ,

dialogue type : %--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  oh , yes ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  in my view , when i when you 've got it densely overlapping , um , I didn't worry about I didn't worry about s specific start times .

dialogue type : s
E :  I sort of thought that this is not gonna be easily processed anyway

dialogue type : s:s^ar
E :  and maybe I shouldn't spend too much time getting exactly when the person said " no " , or , you know , uh , i " immediate " .

dialogue type : s
E :  And instead just sort of rendered " within this time slot , there were two people speaking during part of it

dialogue type : s
E :  and if you want more detail , figure it out for yourself " ,

dialogue type : s^e
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
E :  That happened very seldom .

dialogue type : s^ft^j
E :  Oh , well , thank you Dan .

dialogue type : s^ft^j
E :  Appreciate it .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , if it if there was a word like " right " , you know , then I wou I would indicate that it happened within the same tem time frame

dialogue type : s
E :  but wouldn't say exactly when it happened .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  A lot of overlapping , yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^na
E :  well that 's true .

dialogue type : s
E :  That 's another issue .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aap
E :  Only when it was otherwise gonna be puzzling

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because he was in the other room talking .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  That 's true .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  I know .

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  Well he was

dialogue type : s
E :  so so he was checking the meter levels

dialogue type : s
E :  and and we were handling things while he was labeling the the whatever it was ,

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
E :  the PDA ?

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : fh
E :  you know ,

dialogue type : s:s^cc
E :  so I was saying , like " and I could label this one left .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g
E :  Right ? "

dialogue type : s:s
E :  And he and he said , " I don't see anything " .

dialogue type : s:s
E :  And he said he said , " I wasn't talking to you " .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Or it wasn't it didn't sound quite that rude .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Uh , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  I know .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well , you 'll see .

dialogue type : s
E :  You can listen to it .

dialogue type : s
E :  Oh , I thought it was you who was .

dialogue type : fg|s^df
E :  No , well , but you were you were asking off the wall questions .

dialogue type : s
E :  And that 's w that 's where I added comments .

dialogue type : s
E :  The rest of the time I didn't bother with who was talking to who

dialogue type : s^df
E :  but but this was unusual circum circumstance .

dialogue type : s
E :  Well and part of it was funny , uh reason was because it was a mixed signal

dialogue type : s^df
E :  so you couldn't get any clues from volume that , you know , he was really far away from this conversation .

dialogue type : s
E :  You couldn't do that symmetrically in any case .

dialogue type : s^ba^na
E :  That 's a good idea .

dialogue type : s
E :  But I thought it would be you know , I I didn't wanna add more contextual comments than were needed

dialogue type : s^df
E :  but that , it seemed to me , clarified that the con what was going on .

dialogue type : fh
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk|s
E :  OK , my my focus was to try and maintain conten con content continuity and , uh , to keep it within what he was saying .

dialogue type : s^e
E :  Like I wouldn't say breath groups but prosodic or intonational groups as much as possible .

dialogue type : s^df:b
E :  So if someone said " mm - hmm " in the middle of a of someone 's , uh , uh , intonational contour , I I indicated it as , like what you just did .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  then I indicated it as a segment which contained @ @ this utterance plus an overlap .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  that 's right .

dialogue type : s
E :  And you know , it could be made more precise than that

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , I see what you mean .

dialogue type : s^j
E :  And then " hesitation " .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
E :  OK ,

dialogue type : s:fh
E :  and so then , uh , in terms of like words like " uh " and " um " I just wrote them

dialogue type : s^df
E :  because I figured there 's a limited number ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and I keep them to a uh , limited set

dialogue type : s^df:fh
E :  because it didn't matter if it was " mmm " or " um " , you know , versus " um " .

dialogue type : s
E :  So I just always wrote it as U M .

dialogue type : s:b
E :  And " uh - huh " , you know , " UHUH . " I mean , like a s set of like five .

dialogue type : s
E :  But in any case I didn't mark those .

dialogue type : s
E :  I 'd be happy with that .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  That 'd be fine .

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  It 'd be good to have that in the in the conventions , what 's to be used .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^ba^na
E :  that 's a fine idea .

dialogue type : s^ba^na
E :  That 's a fine idea .

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^aa
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : %-
E :  I d

dialogue type : s^na
E :  Well , you see , that 's possible too .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  Uh - huh .

dialogue type : s
E :  Which allows five .

dialogue type : s^bu
E :  And it can be m edited after the fact ,

dialogue type : qy^g
E :  can't it also ?

dialogue type : s^bu
E :  But their but their format , if you wanted to in indicate the speakers right there instead of doing it through this indirect route , then i they a c window comes up and it only allows you to enter two speakers .

dialogue type : fh
E :  So .

dialogue type : fh
E :  But .

dialogue type : s.%-
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  And that works nicely cuz this so quick to enter .

dialogue type : s
E :  So I wouldn't wanna do it through the interface anyway adding which worry who the speaker was .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then , uh , let 's see what else .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Oh , yes ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  So sometimes a pers I uh

dialogue type : s
E :  in terms of like the continuity of thought for transcriptions , it 's i it isn't just words coming out ,

dialogue type : s
E :  it 's like there 's some purpose for an utterance .

dialogue type : s
E :  And sometimes someone will do a backchannel in the middle of it

dialogue type : s
E :  but you wanna show that it 's continued at a later point .

dialogue type : s
E :  So I have I have a convention of putting like a dash arrow just to indicate that this person 's utterance continues .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then when it uh , catches back up again then there 's an arrow dash ,

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  and then you have the opposite direction to indicate continuation of ones own utterance versus ,

dialogue type : fh
E :  um ,

dialogue type : s
E :  sometimes we had the situation which is you know , which you which you get in conversations , of someone continuing someone else 's utterance ,

dialogue type : s
E :  and in that case I did a tilde arrow versus a arrow tilde , to indicate that it was continuation

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s
E :  Oh , I guess I did equal arrow for the for the own for yourself things

dialogue type : s^df
E :  cuz it 's the speakers the same .

dialogue type : s
E :  And then tilde arrow if it was a different if a different speaker , uh , con continuation .

dialogue type : s
E :  But just , you know , the arrows showing continuation of a thought .

dialogue type : s.%--
E : 

dialogue type : s
E :  you know , at the end of this unit you 'd know what happened later .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  And that was like this person continued

dialogue type : s^df
E :  and you 'd be able to look for the continuation .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
E :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
E :  Yeah , I didn't use it very often .

dialogue type : s^ba
E :  Excellent .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
E :  Well that 's you know , I mean I that 's why I didn't I didn't do it

dialogue type : s.%--
E :  n I mean , that 's why I thought about it , and and re - ev

dialogue type : s
E :  and it didn't do I didn't do it in ten times the the time .

dialogue type : fh
E :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
E :  I also wanted to ask you if you have a time estimate on the part that you transcribed .

dialogue type : qy.%-
E : 

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s
E :  You 're the one who raised the issue .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^bk
E :  OK ,

dialogue type : s^cs
E :  now , w the alternative to a web site would be to put it in Doctor speech .

dialogue type : s^df
E :  Cuz cuz what I have is a soft link to my transcription that I have on my account

dialogue type : s
E :  but it doesn't matter .

dialogue type : b
E :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba

dialogue type : s^bk
