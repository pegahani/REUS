dialogue type : fh|s

dialogue type : s^cs

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^df

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : s^bk

dialogue type : s
D :  Uh . Uh , if you wanna put it that way .

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : fh|s.%-

dialogue type : %-
D :  You know .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
D :  So um .

dialogue type : s^cs^tc
D :  So so we could talk a little bit about that now if if there 's some time .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  Um I jus So the latest result was that um

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  um yot I tested the uh the sort of final version of the PLP configuration um on development test data for for this year 's Hub - five test set .

dialogue type : s
D :  And the recognition performance was exactly , and I mean exactly up to the you know , the first decimal , same as with the uh Mel Cepstra front - end .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yes .

dialogue type : s^bd.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  i overall .

dialogue type : s
D :  They They were The males I think were slightly better and the females were slightly worse but nothing really .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean definitely not significant .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then the really nice thing was that if if we combine the two systems we get a one and a half percent improvement .

dialogue type : %-
D :  So .

dialogue type : %-
D :  t

dialogue type : s
D :  With N - best ROVER , which is like our new and improved version of ROVER .

dialogue type : s
D :  Which u actually uses the whole N - best list from both systems to mmm , uh c combine that .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Next time we have an evaluation they want to do uh , you know , basically a at least the system combination .

dialogue type : fh|qh
D :  Um , and , you know , why not ?

dialogue type : fh
D :  Uh . So .

dialogue type : h|qw^bu
D :  Uh w what do you mean ?

dialogue type : qr
D :  More features in the sense of front - end features or in the sense of just bells and whistles ?

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Well

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  So , we cou

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  You know , if you you know you basically multiply your effort by N , where N is a number of different systems

dialogue type : fh
D :  and Um .

dialogue type : s
D :  So . So one one compromise would be to only to have the everything up to the point where you generate lattices be basically one system

dialogue type : s
D :  and then after that you rescore your lattices with the multiple systems

dialogue type : s
D :  and combine the results and that 's a fairly painless um thing .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  I I think so .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  Maybe a little less because at that point the error rates are lower

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  You know , maybe it 's only one percent or something but that would still be worthwhile doing .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s
D :  Um Jus - You know , just wanted to let you know that that 's working out very nicely .

dialogue type : s^tc.%--
D : 

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  So this was uh really really sort of just to get Dave going with his um experiments .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  And so , uh .

dialogue type : s
D :  But as a result , um , you know , we were sort of wondering why is the Hub - five system doing so well on the digits .

dialogue type : s
D :  And the reason is basically there 's a whole bunch of read speech data in the Hub - five training set .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  And you c

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^nd
D :  No it 's actually , digits is only a maybe a fifth of it .

dialogue type : s
D :  The rest is is read is read TIMIT data and uh ATIS data and Wall Street Journal and stuff like that .

dialogue type : s
D :  A fifth would be maybe uh two hours something .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  But it definitely helps to have the other read data in there

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  You know the error rate is half of what you do if you train only on ti uh TIMIT uh not TIMIT uh TI - digits ,

dialogue type : qw
D :  which is only what

dialogue type : qy^bu^rt
D :  two hours something ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So . Uh , more read speech data definitely helps .

dialogue type : s
D :  And you can leave out all the conversational data with no performance penalty .

dialogue type : %-
D :  That 's e

dialogue type : %-
D :  That was e

dialogue type : b
D :  Right , right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , yeah .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  So we only for the Hub - five training , we 're only using uh a fairly small subset of the Macrophone database .

dialogue type : fh|sj^cs
D :  Um , so , you could beef that up and probably do even better .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , I mean that 's plenty of read speech data .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , Wall Street Journal , uh , take one example .

dialogue type : %--
D :  But um .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , you know that might be useful for the people who train the the digit recognizers to to use uh something other than TI - digits .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^tc
D :  Well , that was that .

dialogue type : s^tc
D :  And then I th guess Chuck and I had some discussions about how to proceed with the tandem uh system

dialogue type : qy^cs^d
D :  and You wanna You wanna see where that stands ?

dialogue type : s
D :  An - And one side effect of that would be that it 's um that the phone set would change .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  forty - eight phones ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Uh which is smaller than the um than the phone set that that we 've been using so far .

dialogue type : sj
D :  And that that that will probably help , actually ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  You know we want to try things like deltas on the tandem features .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so you h have to multiply everything by two or three .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so , you know , fewer dimensions in the phone set would be actually helpful just from a logistics point of view .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s
D :  So so that was the other thing .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then we wanted to s just limit it to maybe uh something on the same order of dimensions as we use in a standard um front - end .

dialogue type : s
D :  So that would mean just doing the top I don't know ten or twelve or something of the KLT dimensions .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Once we have the new M L P trained up , uh one thing I wanted to try just for the fun of it was to actually run uh like a standard hybrid system that is based on you know , those features

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  uh and uh retrain MLP and also the you know , the dictionary that we use for the Hub - five system .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Exactly .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  So that would basically give us a , um , more hopefully a a better system

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  um because you know , compared to what Eric did a while ago , where he trained up , I think , a system based on Broadcast News

dialogue type : s
D :  and then uh tra retraining it on Switchboard

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  But he I think he d he didn't he probably didn't use all the training data that was available .

dialogue type : sj
D :  And his dictionary probably wasn't as tuned to um conversational speech as as the as ours is .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  So .

dialogue type : s
D :  And the dictionary made a huge difference .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Uh . We we made some improvements to the dictionary 's uh to the dictionary about two years ago

dialogue type : s
D :  which resulted in a uh something like a four percent absolute error rate reduction on Switchboard ,

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  But that w

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : fg
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  And And that number I think was on Switchboard - one data ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Where the error rate now is in the twenties .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  So , um .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  That 's yet s

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  just at least to give us an idea of how well the hybrid system would do .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  And the other thing that that would help us to evaluate is to see how well the M L P is trained up .

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s
D :  Because it 's a pretty good um indicator of that .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  So it 's sort of a sanity check of the M L P outputs before we go ahead and train up the uh you know , use them as a basis for the tandem system .

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  No .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Sure .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh oh that 's a good question .

dialogue type : h|s^no
D :  Yeah , we we weren't sure whether it 's worth to just use the alignments um from the S R I recognizer

dialogue type : s
D :  or whether to actually go through one or more iterations of embedded training where you realign .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Alright .

dialogue type : s.%-

dialogue type : %-
D :  Well but i

dialogue type : qy^rt

dialogue type : qrr

dialogue type : s^2.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b

dialogue type : sj.%--
