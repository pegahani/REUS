dialogue type : s^na
D :  I saw her earlier .

dialogue type : %-
D :  I think

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  She 'll probably come up .

dialogue type : s^na^t
D :  I 've got a couple of things to talk about .

dialogue type : h|s^t
D :  Uh , IBM stuff and , um , just getting uh , meeting information organized .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  In my mind .

dialogue type : s
D :  Now the the You saw the note that the PLP now is getting basically the same as the MFCC .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  Yeah . So , um , talked with Brian and gave him the alternatives to the single beep at the end of each utterance that we had generated before .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^j^m
D :  The Chuck chunks .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s
D :  And so he talked it over with the transcriber

dialogue type : s^cs^e
D :  and the transcriber thought that the easiest thing for them would be if there was a beep and then the nu a number , a digit , and then a beep , uh , at the beginning of each one

dialogue type : s^df
D :  and that would help keep them from getting lost .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And , um , so Adam wrote a little script to generate those style , uh , beeps

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I came up here and just recorded the numbers one through ten .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Does it sound OK ?

dialogue type : s
D :  So , um Yeah . We just used those .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
D :  Yeah . He then he d I recorded Actually , I recorded one through ten three times at three different speeds and then he picked .

dialogue type : s
D :  He liked the fastest one , so he just cut those out and spliced them in between , uh , two beeps .

dialogue type : qh
D :  Does it ?

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  That 'll throw them ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g
D :  huh ?

dialogue type : s^am
D :  Yeah . Huh ! Maybe .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  And she said it wasn't gonna the transcriber said it wouldn't be a problem cuz they can actually make a template , uh , that has beep , number , beep .

dialogue type : s
D :  So for them it 'll be very quick

dialogue type : s^e
D :  to to put those in there when they 're transcribing .

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  So , um , we We 're gonna send them one more sample meeting ,

dialogue type : s
D :  uh , and Thilo has run his segmentation .

dialogue type : s
D :  Adam 's gonna generate the chunked file .

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  And then , um , I 'll give it to Brian and they can try that out .

dialogue type : s
D :  And when we get that back we 'll see if that sort of fixes the problem we had with , uh , too many beeps in the last transcription .

dialogue type : h|qy^bu^d^rt
D :  Uh . Our s our On our side ?

dialogue type : qrr
D :  or including IBM 's ?

dialogue type : s^no
D :  Well , I don't know .

dialogue type : s
D :  The last one seemed like it took a couple of weeks .

dialogue type : fh|s^e
D :  Um , maybe even three .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Uh , that 's just the I B M side .

dialogue type : s
D :  Our side is quick .

dialogue type : qw.%-
D :  I mean , I I don't know . How long does your ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Right .

dialogue type : fg
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  I Yeah , I I hope @ @ we can get a better estimate from this one that we send them .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So . Um .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I I don't know yet how long that 'll take .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right . Right .

dialogue type : s^j
D :  Burn - out .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  No .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  For all the Meeting Recorder data .

dialogue type : s^bd
D :  We should have .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um . And so we 've got a plan for what we 're gonna do there .

dialogue type : s
D :  And then , Jane also s prepared a um , started getting all of the the meetings organized , so she prepared a a spreadsheet , which I spent the last couple of days adding to .

dialogue type : s
D :  So I went through all of the data that we have collected so far , and have

dialogue type : s
D :  been putting it into , uh , a spreadsheet with start time , the date , the old meeting name , the new meeting name , the number of speakers , the duration of the meeting , comments , you know , what its transcription status is , all that kind of stuff .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  And so , the idea is that we can take this and then export it as HTML and put it on the Meeting Recorder web page

dialogue type : s^df
D :  so we can keep people updated about what 's going on .

dialogue type : fh|s^cc
D :  Um , I 've gotta get some more information from Jane

dialogue type : s^df
D :  cuz I have some some gaps here that I need to get her to fill in ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but so far , um , as of Monday , the fourteenth , um , we 've had a total number of meeting sixty - two hours of meetings that we have collected .

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Uh , some other interesting things , average number of speakers per meeting is six .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^cc
D :  and I 'm gonna have on here the total amount that 's been transcribed so far ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  uh , that 's what I have to talk to Jane about , figuring out exactly which ones have have been completed and so forth .

dialogue type : s
D :  But , um , this 'll be a nice thing that we can put up on the the web site and people can be informed of the status of various different ones .

dialogue type : s
D :  And it 'll also list , uh , like under the status , if it 's at IBM or if it 's at ICSI , uh , or if it 's completed or which ones we 're excluding

dialogue type : s
D :  and and there 's a place for comments , so we can , um , say why we 're excluding things and so forth .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Content , really .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Talk .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Could it have to do with the the lower frequency cut - off on the Switchboard ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Were they out of balance ?

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I didn't I didn't notice .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  Hmm . We 're using sixty - four ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  right ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^2^bu^d^rt
D :  Than you do with the standard ?

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  Well , that was combined with the triangular .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah . Right .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  The low - frequency cut - off .

dialogue type : qw
D :  What what is the parameter ?

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  Is it , uh , just the f lower cut - off that you want ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  One experiment we should we 'll probably need to do though when um , at some point , is , since we 're using that same the net that was trained on PLP without all these things in it , for the tandem system , we may wanna go back and retrain ,

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  yeah , yeah ,

dialogue type : s^e|s^f
D :  for the tandem . You know ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so we can see if it what effect it has on the tandem processing .

dialogue type : s
D :  So , we But but we may not . I mean , if it doesn't perform as well , we may not know why .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Cuz we need to do the exact experiment .

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
D :  So , Morgan , an another thing that Andreas and I were talking about was ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so @ @ in the first experiment that he did we just took the whole fifty - six , uh , outputs

dialogue type : s
D :  and that 's , um , basically compared to a thirty - nine input feature vector from either MFCC or PLP .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
D :  Yeah . Through the regular tandem outputs .

dialogue type : s^m^na
D :  Through the KLT .

dialogue type : s^e
D :  All that kinda stuff .

dialogue type : s^na
D :  That 's what we did .

dialogue type : qy^d^f^g^rt
D :  Right ?

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  so we treated the th first thirteen as though they were standard features .

dialogue type : qy.%--
D :  I mean , did Dan do experiments like that to ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Cuz in a sense , the net 's already got quite a bit of context in those features ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so if we did deltas and double - deltas on top of those , we 're getting sort of even more .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah . There could be a bug in in the somewhere before that .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^df
D :  E Eric coached me through then that part of it ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so I 'm pretty confident in that .

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , the only slight difference is that I use normalization values that , um , Andreas calculated

dialogue type : s^e
D :  from the original PLP ,

dialogue type : s
D :  which is right .

dialogue type : %--
D :  N

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^bu
D :  Oh , we actually don't do that normalization for the PLP ,

dialogue type : qy^g^rt
D :  do we ?

dialogue type : s^e
D :  For the st just the straight PLP features ?

dialogue type : s^bk^m|s^bk
D :  S R I system does that . Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : fg|s
D :  Yeah . It 's hard with features ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  cuz you don't know what they should look like .

dialogue type : s^df^e.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So another huge experiment we could do would be to take the tandem features , uh , do SRI forced alignments using those features , and then re - do the net with those .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qy.%--
D :  Did he did he try to ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d.%-
D :  So he always ended up with a feature vector that was twice as long as either one of the ?

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  Yeah .
