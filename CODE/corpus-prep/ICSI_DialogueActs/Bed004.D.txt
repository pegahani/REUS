dialogue type : z
D :  OK .

dialogue type : z
D :  I tried to go for the EE Cummings sort of feeling ,

dialogue type : z
D :  but

dialogue type : z
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : z
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : z
D :  No , I didn't see that movie .

dialogue type : z
D :  Who did who made that ?

dialogue type : z
D :  Oh .

dialogue type : z
D :  OK .

dialogue type : z
D :  Uh . We 're having , a

dialogue type : z
D :  tiramisu tasting contest this weekend .

dialogue type : z
D :  No ?

dialogue type : z
D :  Um . There was a a a fierce argument that broke out over whose tiramisu might be the best

dialogue type : z
D :  and so we decided to have a contest where those people who claim to make good tiramisu make them ,

dialogue type : z
D :  and then we got a panel of impartial judges that will taste do a blind taste and then vote .

dialogue type : z
D :  Should be fun .

dialogue type : z
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : z
D : 

dialogue type : z
D :  y you guys have plans for Sunday ?

dialogue type : z
D : 

dialogue type : z
D :  it 's probably going to be this Sunday , but um we 're sort of working with the weather here

dialogue type : z
D :  because we also want to combine it with some barbecue activity where we just fire it up and what whoever brings whatever you know , can throw it on there .

dialogue type : z
D :  So only the tiramisu is free , nothing else .

dialogue type : z
D :  So you 're going to the west Bay then ?

dialogue type : z
D :  No ,

dialogue type : z
D :  south Bay ?

dialogue type : z
D :  South Bay .

dialogue type : z
D :  OK , I 'll let you know .

dialogue type : z
D :  They are gonna get more comfortable headsets .

dialogue type : z
D :  They already ordered them .

dialogue type : fh
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s^co^t
D :  Let 's get started .

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : qy
D :  Should I go first , with the uh , um , data .

dialogue type : qy
D :  Can I have the remote control .

dialogue type : s^ft
D :  Thank you .

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  So . On Friday we had our wizard test data test and um these are some of the results .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  This was the introduction .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  I actually uh , even though Liz was uh kind enough to offer to be the first subject , I sort of felt that she knew too much ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  so I asked uh Litonya . just on the spur of the moment , and she was uh kind enough to uh serve as the first subject .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So , this is what she saw as part of as uh for instr introduction ,

dialogue type : s
D :  this is what she had to read aloud .

dialogue type : s
D :  Uh , that was really difficult for her

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^na^rt.%--
D :  The names and um

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  this was the uh first three tasks she had to to master after she called the system ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  and um then of course the system broke down ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  and those were the l uh uh

dialogue type : s^rt
D : 

dialogue type : fh
D :  Um .

dialogue type : s
D :  There are here are uh the results .

dialogue type : fh
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^t
D :  We will skip the reading now .

dialogue type : fh
D :  D Um .

dialogue type : fh
D :  And um .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  The reading was five minutes , exactly .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  It was bo it both times the same person .

dialogue type : s
D :  One time , pretending to be a system ,

dialogue type : s
D :  one time , to pretending to be a human , which is actually not pretending .

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  No no no .

dialogue type : s^co
D :  We u Wait .

dialogue type : sj^ba.%--
D :  OK , good question , but uh

dialogue type : s^co
D :  you you just wait and see .

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's You 're gonna l learn .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  And um the wizard sometimes will not be audible ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  Because she was actually they there was some uh lapse in the um wireless ,

dialogue type : s
D :  we have to move her closer .

dialogue type : s
D :  They 're mispronouncing everything ,

dialogue type : %--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  This is the system breaking down , actually .

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  " Did I call Europe ? "

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  So , this is it .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  Well , if we we um

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  There was a strange reflex .

dialogue type : s
D :  I have a headache .

dialogue type : s
D :  I 'm really sort of out of it .

dialogue type : s^t^tc
D :  OK , the uh lessons learned .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  The reading needs to be shorter .

dialogue type : sj
D :  Five minutes is just too long .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  Um , that was already anticipated by some people suggested that if we just have bullets here , they 're gonna not they 're subjects are probably not gonna going to follow the order .

dialogue type : s
D :  And uh she did not .

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  No .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  She she jumped around quite a bit .

dialogue type : s^aa|s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  Um . We need to So that 's one thing .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs^rt
D :  And we need a better introduction for the wizard .

dialogue type : s
D :  That is something that Fey actually thought of a in the last second that sh the system should introduce itself , when it 's called .

dialogue type : fg|s^cs
D :  And um , um , another suggestion , by Liz , was that we uh , through subjects , switch the tasks .

dialogue type : s^e^rt
D :  So when when they have task - one with the computer , the next person should have task - one with a human , and so forth .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  So we get nice um data for that .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
D :  Um , we have to refine the tasks more and more , which of course we haven't done at all , so far , in order to avoid this rephrasing ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so where , even though w we don't tell the person " ask blah - blah - blah - blah - blah "

dialogue type : s
D :  they still try , or at least Litonya tried to um repeat as much of that text as possible .

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
D :  And uh my suggestion is of course we we keep the wizard , because I think she did a wonderful job ,

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  in the sense that she responded quite nicely to things that were not asked for ,

dialogue type : qw
D :  " How much is a t a bus ticket and a transfer "

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  so this is gonna happen all the time , we d you can never be sure .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  Um . Johno pointed out that uh we have maybe a grammatical gender problem there with wizard .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So um .

dialogue type : fg
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Well , there is witch and warlock ,

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : fg
D :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
D : 

dialogue type : fh|s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  And this , and in case no you hadn't seen it , this is what Litonya looked at during the uh um while taking the while partaking in the data collection .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  I 'm completely clueless , but I 'm willing to learn .

dialogue type : %
D :  N

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Student - type worker ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  or ?

dialogue type : b
D :  Hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
D :  This is sort of what I gave her , so this is for example h how to get to the student prison ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and I didn't even spell it out here

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  and in some cases I I spelled it out a little bit um more thoroughly ,

dialogue type : s
D :  this is the information on on the low sunken castle , and the amphitheater that never came up ,

dialogue type : fh|sj^cs
D :  and um , so i if we give her even more um , instruments to work with I think the results are gonna be even better .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
D :  Yeah she she didn't explicitly state that

dialogue type : fh
D :  so .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And um I told her that we gonna um figure out a meeting time in the near future to refine the tasks and s look for the potential sources to find people .

dialogue type : s
D :  She also agrees that you know if it 's all just gonna be students the data is gonna be less valuable because of that

dialogue type : fh
D :  so .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ng
D :  However , we may run into a problem with a reading task there .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And um , we 'll see .

dialogue type : b^rt
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : b^rt
D :  OK .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj^ba
D :  Sounds good .

dialogue type : s^t.%--
D :  The uh other two things is um

dialogue type : s^cs^rt^t
D :  we 've can have Johno tell us a little about this

dialogue type : s^rt^t
D :  and we also have a l little bit on the interface ,

dialogue type : s^e^rt^t
D :  M - three - L enhancement ,

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  and then um that was it , I think .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qw
D :  What 's " tourbook " ?

dialogue type : b^rt
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj
D :  Well , I think this is still , I mean , ad - hoc .

dialogue type : s
D :  This is sort of th the second version and I I I look at this maybe just as a , you know , a a whatever , UML diagram or , you know , as just a uh screen shot , not really as a Bayes - net as John Johno said .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
D :  But the uh the the nice thing is that you know , it just is a is a visual aid for thinking about these things which has comple clearly have to be specified m more carefully

dialogue type : %-
D :  and uh

dialogue type : fg|s.%--
D :  I mean , ultimately we we may w w

dialogue type : s
D :  we regard this as sort of an exercise in in thinking about the problem

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  and maybe a first version of uh a module , if you wanna call it that , that you can ask ,

dialogue type : s
D :  that you can give input

dialogue type : s
D :  and it it 'll uh throw the dice for you ,

dialogue type : s^bc
D :  uh throw the die for you ,

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because um I integrated this into the existing SmartKom system in in the same way as much the same way we can um sort of have this uh this thing .

dialogue type : s^t1
D :  Close this down .

dialogue type : s
D :  So if this is what M - three - L um will look like and what it 'll give us ,

dialogue type : fh
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  And a very simple thing .

dialogue type : s
D :  We have an action that he wants to go from somewhere , which is some type of object , to someplace .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  It 's doing it twice now because it already did it once .

dialogue type : fh|s^cc
D :  Um , we 'll add some action type , which in this case is " Approach " and could be , you know , more refined uh in many ways .

dialogue type : s
D :  Or we can uh have something where the uh goal is a public place

dialogue type : s
D :  and it will give us then of course an action type of the type " Enter " .

dialogue type : s^bs
D :  So this is just based on this one um , on this one feature ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and that 's that 's about all you can do .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  And so in the f

dialogue type : s
D :  if this pla if the object type um here is is a m is a landmark , of course it 'll be um " Vista " .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And um this is about as much as we can do if we don't w if we want to avoid uh uh a huge combinatorial explosion where we specify " OK , if it 's this and this but that is not the case " , and so forth , it just gets really really messy .

dialogue type : qw
D :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Exactly .

dialogue type : s
D :  Every public place you enter , and statue you want to go as near as possible .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj
D :  And it it would do us no good .

dialogue type : s
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Ultimately .

dialogue type : %-
D :  W

dialogue type : qw^rt
D :  Hmm ?

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  No .

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
D :  No .

dialogue type : %--
D :  And

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  this is just in order to exemplify what what we can do very , very easily is , um

dialogue type : s
D :  we have this this silly uh interface and we have the rules that are as banal as of we just saw , and we have our content .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I whi which is sort of what what we see here , which is sort of the Vista , Schema , Source , Path , Goal , whatever .

dialogue type : s
D :  This will um be um a job to find ways of writing down Image schema , X - schema , constructions , in some some form ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and have this be in a in a in the content ,

dialogue type : s
D :  loosely called " Constructicon " .

dialogue type : s
D :  And the rules we want to throw away completely .

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  And um and here is exactly where what 's gonna be replaced with our Bayes - net ,

dialogue type : s
D :  which is exactly getting the input feeding into here .

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  the the Enter ,

dialogue type : s
D :  the Vista ,

dialogue type : s
D :  or the whatever

dialogue type : s
D :  uh Approach um construction should be activated , IE just pasted in .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Aspects of the X - schema to add .

dialogue type : s^2
D :  Object type ,

dialogue type : b
D :  mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  Also it strikes me that we we m may want to approach the point where we can sort of try to find a uh , a specification for some interface , here that um takes the normal M - three - L , looks at it .

dialogue type : s
D :  Then we discussed in our pre - edu EDU meeting um how to ask the ontology , what to ask the ontology

dialogue type : fh|s
D :  um the fact that we can pretend we have one , make a dummy until we get the real one ,

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
D :  and so um we we may wanna decide we can do this from here ,

dialogue type : s^e
D :  but we also could do it um you know if we have a a a belief - net interface .

dialogue type : s
D :  So the belief - net takes as input , a vector ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  right ?

dialogue type : s^e
D :  of stuff .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^rt
D :  And um it Output is whatever , as well .

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  But this information is just M - three - L ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and then we want to look up some more stuff in the ontology

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  maybe we want to ask the real world ,

dialogue type : s^cs^rt
D :  maybe you want to look something up in the GRS ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but also we definitely want to look up in the dialogue history um some s some stuff .

dialogue type : %--
D :  Based on

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  I was just made some examples from the ontology

dialogue type : s
D :  and so we have for example some information there that the town hall is both a a a building and it has doors and stuff like this ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but it is also an institution , so it has a mayor and so forth and so forth

dialogue type : s
D :  and we get relations out of it and once we have them , we can use that information to look in the dialogue history ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  " were any of these things that that are part of the town hall as an institution mentioned ? " ,

dialogue type : qy^rt
D :  " were any of these that make the town hall a building mentioned ? " ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and so forth ,

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  and maybe draw some inferences on that .

dialogue type : sj^rt
D :  So this may be a a sort of a process of two to three steps before we get our vector , that we feed into the belief - net ,

dialogue type : %-
D : 

dialogue type : s^aa
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  So this is actually , s if if we were to build something that is um ,

dialogue type : h|s
D :  and , uh , I had one more thing ,

dialogue type : s.%--
D : 

dialogue type : fh
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : sj^cc
D :  I think we I I can come up with a a code for a module that we call the " cognitive dispatcher " , which does nothing ,

dialogue type : s
D :  but it looks of complect object trees and decides how are there parts missing that need to be filled out ,

dialogue type : s
D :  there 's this is maybe something that this module can do , something that this module can do

dialogue type : s
D :  and then collect uh sub - objects and then recombine them and put them together .

dialogue type : s^cs
D :  So maybe this is actually some some useful tool that we can use to rewrite it , and uh get this part ,

dialogue type : %--
D :  then .

dialogue type : s
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
D :  There 're no primitives upon which uh

dialogue type : b
D :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
D :  Maybe we sho

dialogue type : qy:qw^rt
D :  should we a add then the " what 's this ? " domain ?

dialogue type : %--
D :  N

dialogue type : s
D :  I mean , we have to

dialogue type : s:qw
D :  " how do I get to X " .

dialogue type : s.%--:qw.%--
D : 

dialogue type : s
D :  Um Johno , actually , does not allow us to call them " intentions " anymore .

dialogue type : s
D :  So he he dislikes the term .

dialogue type : fg|sj
D :  But um , I 'm sure the " what 's this ? " questions also create some interesting X - schema aspects .

dialogue type : fh
D :  So .

dialogue type : b^rt
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^2.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
D :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : sj
D :  It 's unfortunate also that English has sort of got rid of most of its spatial adverbs

dialogue type : s^df
D :  because they 're really fancy then , in in for these kinds of analysis .

dialogue type : fh
D :  But uh .

dialogue type : s^aap
D :  Yeah , but they 're they 're easier for parsers .

dialogue type : s
D :  Parsers can pick those up but but the with the spatial adverbs , they have a tough time .

dialogue type : s
D :  Because the mean the semantics are very complex in that .

dialogue type : b
D :  OK , yeah ?

dialogue type : s^t1
D :  I had one more thing .

dialogue type : s^no
D :  I don't remember .

dialogue type : s
D :  I just forgot it again .

dialogue type : h
D :  No .

dialogue type : s^fe
D :  Oh yeah ,

dialogue type : s
D :  b But an architecture like this would also enable us maybe to to throw this away and and replace it with something else , or whatever ,

dialogue type : s
D :  so that we have so that this is sort of the representational formats we 're we 're we 're talking about that are independent of the problem ,

dialogue type : s
D :  that generalize over those problems , and are oh , t of a higher quality than an any actual whatever um belief - net , or " X " that we may use for the decision making , ultimately .

dialogue type : s
D :  Should be decoupled , yeah .

dialogue type : b
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  Yeah , um , Liz also asks whether we 're gonna have presentations every time .

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : h
D :  And um .

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : qh
D :  Yeah ?

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  The uh um , she w she was definitely good in the sense that she she showed us some of the weaknesses

dialogue type : fh|s.%-
D : 

dialogue type : b
D :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
D :  So I think that um I mean , w

dialogue type : s
D :  Looking just looking at this data , listening to it , what can we get out of it in terms of our problem ,

dialogue type : s
D :  for example , is , you know , she actually m said you know , she never s just spoke about entering , she just wanted to get someplace , and she said for buying stuff .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Nuh ?

dialogue type : sj.%--
D : 

dialogue type : fh|s^rt
D :  Um , and in the other case , where she wanted to look at the stuff at the graffiti ,

dialogue type : s
D :  also , of course , not in the sentence " How do you get there ? " was pretty standard .

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
D :  Nuh ?

dialogue type : s
D :  except that there was a nice anaphora , you know , for pointing at what she talked about before ,

dialogue type : s
D :  and there she was talking about looking at pictures that are painted inside a wall on walls ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  so

dialogue type : s
D :  Actually , you 'd need a lot of world knowledge .

dialogue type : sj
D :  This would have been a classical um uh " Tango " , actually .

dialogue type : fh|s^df
D :  Um , because graffiti is usually found on the outside and not on the inside ,

dialogue type : fh
D :  but

dialogue type : s^bk
D :  OK .

dialogue type : s
D :  So the mistake would have make a mistake the system would have made a mistake here .
