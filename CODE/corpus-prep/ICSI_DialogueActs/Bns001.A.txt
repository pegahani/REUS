dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %
A :  Hm

dialogue type : s.%-
A :  I think you

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
A : 

dialogue type : qy^cs^d^rt
A :  In this thing of seamless handoff or handovers should think more maybe in different layers ?

dialogue type : s^df
A :  So one layer is having the seamless handover .

dialogue type : s
A :  It 's clear if a technology doesn't provide that quality of service , you can't do magic and have it .

dialogue type : s
A :  There are certain constraints on that .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  It 's true .

dialogue type : s
A :  That 's still in mind .

dialogue type : s
A :  But for with the cases there There , it is possible .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
A :  So that should be made possible then ?

dialogue type : fg
A :  So

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
A :  There are still enough problems i in doing it .

dialogue type : s^bk
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  But it might be the wrong thing to promise , uh , ten megabits to everywhere .

dialogue type : s
A :  There you are .

dialogue type : s
A :  But saying " OK if it 's a if the technology is OK , you can do it . "

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : b
A :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : z
A :  Hi .

dialogue type : z
A :  ist fertig .

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  How 's it start ?

dialogue type : qw^rt
A :  Who is using mobile phones ?

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^df
A :  But usually WAP shouldn't is so general that it can be used with UMTS .

dialogue type : s
A :  So if you still want to use WAP with UMTS you might be able to do it .

dialogue type : %-
A :  But

dialogue type : s.%-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  But usually that 's not the reason to have UMTS .

dialogue type : s^aa
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s
A :  My impression on this proposal is that every single block has some research done already .

dialogue type : s
A :  So , multicast . This means that there are many things done .

dialogue type : qw^t1
A :  Oh , what was it ?

dialogue type : s
A :  Maybe I was routing mobility management

dialogue type : s
A :  But no one actually put them together .

dialogue type : s
A :  But So that 's the big problem .

dialogue type : s
A :  But the problem with this problem , might be that it 's too big

dialogue type : s^e.%-
A :  to put all these big pieces to

dialogue type : s
A :  So that you really have a complete a complete scenario .

dialogue type : s
A :  You have , in one scenario , multicast , quality of service , routing and mobile um networking .

dialogue type : s
A :  Not just the islands alone .

dialogue type : fg|%-
A : 

dialogue type : b
A :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
A : 

dialogue type : s
A :  But for theoretical or for historical reasons a really good question , " if we would have the money what would we do with that ? "

dialogue type : s
A :  So if we don't know what we would like to do with the money , we probably wouldn't get any money to do what we don't know .

dialogue type : s
A :  So that 's why , I think , yeah , it 's a good question .

dialogue type : b
A :  Yep .

dialogue type : s^na
A :  That 's just the same question just other way around .

dialogue type : s^ba^t1
A :  Modernistic stuff !

dialogue type : s^ba^t1
A :  Completely useless !
