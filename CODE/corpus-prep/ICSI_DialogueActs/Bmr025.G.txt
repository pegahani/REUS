dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^co
G :  Guess who I practice on ?

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  So another idea I w t had just now actually for the demo was whether it might be of interest to sh to show some of the prosody uh work that Don 's been doing .

dialogue type : fh|s^cs^e
G :  Um actually show some of the features

dialogue type : s^cs^e
G :  and then show for instance a task like finding sentence boundaries or finding turn boundaries .

dialogue type : fh
G :  Um ,

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  you know , you can show that graphically , sort of what the features are doing .

dialogue type : s
G :  It , you know , it doesn't work great but it 's definitely giving us something .

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I don't know if that would be of interest or not .

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , you 're looking at this now

dialogue type : qr^rt
G :  Are you looking at Waves or Matlab ?

dialogue type : s^aa.%-
G :  Yeah def

dialogue type : %-
G :  I

dialogue type : qr^bu
G :  Oh , the end of this month or next month ?

dialogue type : s^bk|qy^bu^d^rt
G :  Oh , you mean like today ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  Oh .

dialogue type : s^bk^m
G :  Next month .

dialogue type : s^fa
G :  Sorry .

dialogue type : s^fa^r
G :  Sorry .

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^cs.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G :  cuz we 're doing this anyway as part of our you know , the research ,

dialogue type : s^e
G :  visualizing what these features are doing

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  it might not be integrated

dialogue type : s
G :  but it it could potentially be in it .

dialogue type : s
G :  Could find some .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean it 's different .

dialogue type : s
G :  I don't think anyone has done this on meeting data

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  so it might be neat , you know .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Oh , quick question on that . Is do we have the the seat information ?

dialogue type : qy^e^rt
G :  In in the Key files now ?

dialogue type : s^bk.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^2
G :  For the new one

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Great .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Sea - yeah .

dialogue type : b
G :  Alright .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : b
G :  Alright .

dialogue type : s^bd
G :  Never mind .

dialogue type : s:qr^rt
G :  I 'm just trying to figure out , you know , when Morgan 's voice appears on someone 's microphone are they next to him or are they across from him ?

dialogue type : s
G :  Cuz I mean I haven't been putting it in

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^r
G :  I have not .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G :  Well it

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean they 're on th right , these ,

dialogue type : s
G :  but I just hadn't ever been putting it in the Key files .

dialogue type : s
G :  And I don't think Chuck was either

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^bk|s^fa
G :  Oh , so we 're both sorry .

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Right . Well I I just realized I hadn't been doing it

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa
G : 

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G :  I don't ,

dialogue type : s.%-
G :  maybe I forgot to d

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : fg
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s:qw
G :  And I was I was looking at Chuck 's , like , " oh what did Chuck do ,

dialogue type : s:s^cc
G :  OK I 'll do that " .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : fg
G : 

dialogue type : s^cc
G :  We will do better .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : qo
G :  Well , what if you 're sitting there and you just wanna make an X

dialogue type : s
G :  and you don't wanna take notes

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  and you 're you just wanna

dialogue type : s
G :  get the summary of the transcript from this time location

dialogue type : s
G :  like you know , and and then while you 're bored you don't do anything

dialogue type : s
G :  and once in a while , maybe there 's a joke and you put a X

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : s^bs^cs
G :  in in other words you can use that just to highlight times in a very simple way .

dialogue type : s
G :  Also with I was thinking and I know Morgan disagrees with me on this

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  but suppose you have a group in here and you wanna let them note whenever they think there might be something later that they might not wanna distribute in terms of content ,

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  they could just sort of make an X near that point

dialogue type : s^e
G :  or a question mark that sort of alerts them that when they get the transcript back they c could get some red flags in that transcript region

dialogue type : s^e
G :  and they can then look at it .

dialogue type : fh
G :  So .

dialogue type : s
G :  I know we haven't been using it

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  but I w I can imagine it being useful just for sort of marking time periods

dialogue type : s^e
G :  which you then get back in a transcript

dialogue type : fh
G :  so .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s
G :  And you don't have a lot of other cues that might be useful ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  so .

dialogue type : qy^rt
G :  Well , could we keep one of these things for another year ?

dialogue type : s^df.%-
G :  Would h I mean is there a big cau

dialogue type : s^df.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  even maybe some of the transcribers who might be wanting to annotate

dialogue type : s
G :  uh f just there 's a bunch of things that might be neat to do

dialogue type : s
G :  but I it might not be the case that we can actually synchronize them and then do all the infrastructure

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  but we could at least try it out .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Right .

dialogue type : s
G :  Yeah I don't think it has to be part of a what everybody does in a meeting

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  but it might be a useful , neat part of the project

dialogue type : s^df
G :  that we can , you know , show off as a mechanism for synchronizing events in time

dialogue type : s^df^e
G :  that happen that you just wanna make a note of ,

dialogue type : s
G :  like what Jane was talking about

dialogue type : s^e
G :  with some later browsing , just just as a convenience ,

dialogue type : s
G :  even if it 's not a full - blown note taking substitute .

dialogue type : qw.%--
G :  So what kind of input would you be ?

dialogue type : qy^d.%-
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah ,

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  that be good .

dialogue type : %-
G :  M

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  right .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  That would be fine too .

dialogue type : s
G :  I mean , I don't have , you know , grandiose ideas in mind

dialogue type : s:s
G :  but I 'm just sort of thinking well we 've we 're getting into the next year now

dialogue type : s
G :  and we have a lot of these things worked out at in terms of the speech

dialogue type : s
G :  maybe somebody will be interested in this

dialogue type : fh
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^2:s
G :  Or like this is my " I 'm supposed to do this " kind of button ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  like " I better remember to "

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah

dialogue type : s^e
G :  something like that

dialogue type : %--
G : 

dialogue type : b
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
G :  W

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : s
G :  Well it also it 's maybe realistic cuz people are supposed to be bringing their P D As to the meeting eventually ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
G :  right ?

dialogue type : s^df.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  I don't know what I don't wanna cause more work for anyone

dialogue type : s
G :  but I can imagine some interesting things that you could do with it

dialogue type : s.%--
G :  and so if we don't have to return it

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s^no
G :  I don't know .

dialogue type : s^aa
G :  Yeah .

dialogue type : %-
G :  We c

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  One would probably be fine .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  Maybe we could do like a student project ,

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  you know , maybe someone who wants to do this as their main like s project for something would be cool .

dialogue type : fg|s.%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  Jeremy 's gonna be an he 's a new student starting on modeling brea breath and laughter , actually ,

dialogue type : s^rt
G :  which sounds funny

dialogue type : s^ba^rt
G :  but I think it should be cool ,

dialogue type : fh
G :  so .

dialogue type : b
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^j
G :  " Ha - ha - ha . "

dialogue type : qy^rt^t3
G :  You 're you 're gonna tease me ?

dialogue type : s^bk
G :  OK .

dialogue type : s^ba
G :  Great .

dialogue type : s^j
G :  That 's a very philosophical statement from Morgan .

dialogue type : s
G :  I just it 's sort of a anachronism ,

dialogue type : s.%--
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  It 's great .

dialogue type : s^cs
G :  We could do simultaneous .

dialogue type : s^df
G :  Initiate him .

dialogue type : fg|qy
G :  Well , I 'm just thinking , are you gonna try to save the data before this next group comes in ?

dialogue type : s^cs^r^rt
G :  Yeah , so we might wanna do it simultaneous .

dialogue type : s^aa|%-
G : 

dialogue type : s
G :  so we might n we might need to do that actually .

dialogue type : s^co
G :  You have to plug your ears , by the way uh Eric ,

dialogue type : %-
G : 

dialogue type : s^df
G :  or you start laughing .
