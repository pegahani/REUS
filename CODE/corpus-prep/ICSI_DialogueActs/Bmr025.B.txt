dialogue type : fh

B :  cuz the the next next occupants were pushing for it ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Um .

dialogue type : fh
B :  So .

dialogue type : s^t

dialogue type : s^bk^rt
B :  OK .

dialogue type : qy^rt^t

dialogue type : qr
B :  or that 's something you 're having to program ?

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  And then again , maybe not .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , that soun that sounds reasonable .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah , it loo it my my recollection of it is it 's it 's a pretty reasonable uh demo sort of format .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : qo^cs
B :  How about having it run under free BSD ?

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s^co
B :  But it would what would serve would serve both purposes , is if you contact him and ask him if he 's already done it .

dialogue type : s
B :  If he has then you learn ,

dialogue type : s
B :  if he hasn't then he 'll do it .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Tony Robinson ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Steve Renal - Steve Renals .

dialogue type : s^ar
B :  No .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Oh , OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  The thing I was asking about with , um , free BSD is that it might be easier to

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^tc
B :  So there was that demo , which was one of the main ones ,

dialogue type : s
B :  then we talked about um some other stuff

dialogue type : s
B :  which would basically be um showing off the the Transcriber interface itself

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  and as you say , maybe we could even merge those in some sense ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  but but um ,

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  uh and part of that was showing off what the speech - non uh nonspeech stuff that Thilo has done s looks like .

dialogue type : b^rt
B :  Mm - hmm .

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  Well I think

dialogue type : s^na
B :  at at the very least we 're gonna want something illustrative with that

dialogue type : s^df
B :  cuz I 'm gonna want to talk about it

dialogue type : s
B :  and so i if there 's something that shows it graphically it 's much better than me just having a bullet point

dialogue type : s^e
B :  pointing at something I don't know much about ,

dialogue type : fh
B :  so .

dialogue type : s
B :  S so when we here were having this demo meeting , what we 're sort of coming up with is that we wanna have all these pieces together , to first order , by the end of the month

dialogue type : s
B :  and then that 'll give us a week or so .

dialogue type : %-
B :  Ju

dialogue type : s
B :  June . June . June .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Uh that 'll that 'll give us that 'll give us a week or so to uh to port things over to my laptop and make sure that works ,

dialogue type : b
B :  yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  Yeah . Well , this is to an audience of researchers

dialogue type : %--
B :  so I mean , you know ,

dialogue type : s
B :  to let s the goal is to let them know what it is we 're doing .

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Good .

dialogue type : s^rt^t^tc
B :  Done with that .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt^t^tc
B :  XML tools ?

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Seat ?

dialogue type : s^bk|s
B :  Oh ! Not not the quality or anything . No .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK . I see .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  That 's more seat information than we wanted .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Mmm , yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  Some of these are missing .

dialogue type : qy^rt
B :  Aren't they ?

dialogue type : s^t1.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  Ah , OK .

dialogue type : s^j
B :  Small shocks

dialogue type : %-
B : 

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK .

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  if it 's stationary it 's not going to go through the increment it 's not gonna burden things in the incremental backups .

dialogue type : s^aa|s
B :  Yeah , so the monthly full will be a bear

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : qy^bh
B :  Really ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So I guess the idea is that we would be reserving the non - backed - up space for things that took less than twenty - four hours to recreate or something like that ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  OK .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  So we can get more disk .

dialogue type : fh
B :  Yeah . So .

dialogue type : s^bk
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm !

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  Good . CrossPads ?

dialogue type : qo^d^rt^t^tc
B :  CrossPads ?

dialogue type : s^bu
B :  So we 've never used them .

dialogue type : qy^bu^d^rt
B :  Once ?

dialogue type : %-
B :  i

dialogue type : fg
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  So it 's it 's um it 's a regular pad , just a regular pad of paper but there 's this pen which indicates position .

dialogue type : s
B :  And so you have time and position stuff stored

dialogue type : s
B :  so that you can you have a record of whatever it is you 've written .

dialogue type : s
B :  And one of the reasons that it was brought up originally was because uh we were interested in in higher - level things ,

dialogue type : s
B :  not just the , you know , microphone stuff but also summarization and so forth

dialogue type : s:qw
B :  and the question is if you were going to go to some gold standard of what wa what was it that happened in the meeting you know , where would it come from ?

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  And um I think that was one of the things ,

dialogue type : qy^d^g^rt
B :  right ?

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  And so the it seemed like a neat idea .

dialogue type : s^rt
B :  We 'll have a you know , have a scribe ,

dialogue type : s
B :  have somebody uh take good notes and then that 's part of the record of the meeting .

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : s^j
B :  probably chose the wrong scribe

dialogue type : s.%--
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^m
B :  Summary .

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  I guess so , you know , what what makes one think i is maybe we should actually schedule some periods where people go over something later

dialogue type : s
B :  and and and put some kind of summary or something

dialogue type : fh|s^cs
B :  uh you know , some there 'd be some scribe who would actually listen , w who 'd agreed to actually listen to the whole thing ,

dialogue type : s
B :  not transcribe it , but just sort of write down things that struck them as important .

dialogue type : s
B :  But then you don't you don't have the time reference uh that you 'd have if you had it live .

dialogue type : s^am
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s
B :  Well one thing that we might try um is on some set of meetings , some collection of meetings , maybe EDU is the right one or maybe something else ,

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  we we get somebody to buy into the idea of doing this as part of the task .

dialogue type : %-
B :  I mean ,

dialogue type : s
B :  uh part of the reason I think part of the reason that Adam was so interested in uh the SpeechCorder sort of f idea from the beginning is he said from the beginning he hated taking notes

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s^e
B :  and so forth

dialogue type : fh|s
B :  so and and Jane is more into it

dialogue type : fh
B :  but eh uh

dialogue type : s^no
B :  you know I don't know if you wanna really do do this all the time

dialogue type : s^cs
B :  so I think the thing is to to get someone to actually buy into it

dialogue type : s^cs^e
B :  and have at least some series of meetings where we do it .

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : s
B :  and if so , it 's probably worth having one .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  The p the the problem with the the more extended view ,

dialogue type : s^e.%--
B :  all these other you know with uh quibbling about particular applications of it

dialogue type : s^e
B :  is that it looks like it 's hard to get people to um uh routinely use it ,

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean it just hasn't happened anyway .

dialogue type : s^cs.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^na
B :  Yeah , I do like the idea of having a couple buttons

dialogue type : s^e:s^fe
B :  where like one one button was " uh - oh "

dialogue type : s^e:s^ba
B :  and then another button was " that 's great "

dialogue type : s.%-
B :  and another button " that 's f "

dialogue type : b
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s^aa|s^na
B :  No , no , but it 's just it 's just storing the pixel informa position information ,

dialogue type : s
B :  it 's all digital .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Right .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah . Yeah .

dialogue type : s.%--
B :  So we have no

dialogue type : s^co
B :  but uh by I I would suggest you return one .

dialogue type : s^df
B :  Because we we you know , we we haven't used it at all .

dialogue type : s
B :  We have some aspirations of using them

dialogue type : fh
B : 

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^cs^j
B :  Maybe Jeremy could sit in some meetings and press a button when there when when somebody laughed .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah , yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : b
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s^fe
B :  Well dear .

dialogue type : b
B :  Hmm .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK .

dialogue type : s
B :  You know what he means

dialogue type : qh^rt
B :  but isn't that funny sounding ?

dialogue type : s:s
B :  " We ordered more wireless . "

dialogue type : s
B :  It 's like wires are the things

dialogue type : s
B :  so you 're wiring you 're you 're you we 're we ordered more absence of the thing .

dialogue type : fg
B :  Anyway .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : s
B :  I mean there 's there 's all this stuff going on uh between uh Andreas and and and Dave and Chuck and others with various kinds of runs

dialogue type : fh|s^e
B :  uh um recognition runs ,

dialogue type : s
B :  trying to figure things out about the features

dialogue type : s
B :  but it 's it 's all sort of in process ,

dialogue type : s
B :  so there 's not much to say

dialogue type : s^e
B :  right now .

dialogue type : fh|qh^cs^t
B :  Uh why don't we start with our our esteemed guest .

dialogue type : s.%-
B : 

dialogue type : s^na
B :  We we could .

dialogue type : s^aa
B :  Yeah .

dialogue type : fg|s^co
B :  Well OK , so let 's do one of those simultaneous ones .

dialogue type : s^ba
B :  That sounds good .

dialogue type : qy^d^rt
B :  Everybody ready ?

dialogue type : s
B :  A one .

dialogue type : fg
B :  OK ,

dialogue type : s
B :  a one and a two and a three .

dialogue type : z
B :  OK , babble , take five .
